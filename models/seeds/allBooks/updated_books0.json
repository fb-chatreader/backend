[{"title":"#GIRLBOSS","author":"Sophia Amoruso","summary":"What kind of chief executive drops out of high school and then spends years dumpster-diving, shoplifting and working mediocre jobs to pay the bills? A truly kick-ass one like author Sophia Amoruso, who used her colorful life experience to start one of the most successful fashion companies in the past decade. In #GIRLBOSS, Amoruso explains how she turned a vintage clothes hobby into a multimillion-dollar business. In these blinks, you’ll learn how she also used her creativity and her business savvy to launch a worldwide movement to connect young women. In the following blinks, you’ll also discover: what hitchhiking teaches you about entrepreneurship; how you need to forget everything you learned in school to truly succeed; and why working at a big chain bookstore can make you the world’s best boss. When you were growing up, did your parents tell you that if you failed in school, you’d fail in life? Well, it’s not true. Some people do well at school; others don’t. Either way, good grades won’t determine whether you’ll achieve success later in life. After all, there are many different kinds of people in the world, and each person has different skills. Being successful is matter of figuring out what you’re good at and parlaying that skill into a career. Once you identify your special talent, this will free you to focus on what you enjoy and what you’re good at. This way, you can perform to the best of your ability and in tandem, succeed. That’s the story of Sophia Amoruso. She had a knack for negotiating discounts on coveted vintage clothing and then reselling items for a healthy profit. The venture started as a hobby, but the thrill and challenge eventually drove her to establish her own clothing empire. The author was simply being herself and doing what she was good at; that’s what made her successful. But she was able to find this path as she had accepted her own strengths and weakness. Accepting yourself is incredibly important – because as mentioned above, people are different. There are extroverts and introverts, and each type has an environment that works best for them. Extroverts flourish when they’re interacting with others. This personality type is well-suited for working on Wall Street, for example, where you have to push and shove and shout to make trades. But such an environment would be a nightmare for an introvert. In Amoruso’s case, her inner introvert blossomed thanks to social media. She built customer relationships online, where she could interact with fans in a measured, non-aggressive way. If you want to achieve greatness, it’s important to realize that no matter how motivated you are, there’s no straight line to success. And in fact, trying to follow a straight path will only limit you, as you might miss out on new and surprising opportunities. Imagine an aspiring astronaut who has spent years with his head buried in books. During his first zero-gravity flight test, he discovers he has severe motion sickness. Even though he spent his whole life training to be an astronaut, his laser-like focus prevented him from finding the right path that would truly suit his abilities. So choose a more serpentine path – yet know that you might have to take a few odd jobs along the way. Some people resist this, but you’ll see that you can learn something new with each opportunity. Although she was an anti-capitalist, Amoruso once took a job working at a large commercial bookstore chain. She started with a bad attitude and carried a lot of prejudices, but ultimately acquired customer service skills that would later set her own business apart. There are unexpected advantages to following an unconventional path. There is also, of course, the other side of the coin: failure. Failure can happen to anyone – so don’t fear it, own it! Chances are, if you aren’t succeeding at something, then what you’re doing isn’t fueling your inner passion. If it were, it would be effortless. That’s exactly what Amoruso discovered. Prior to starting her own business, she’d had her fair share of failures, dozens of jobs from which she was either fired or quit. At the time, she thought the reason things weren’t working out was because she was lazy. But the truth was that these jobs simply didn’t work for her. Yet when she was collecting clothes and bargaining and selling her creations on eBay, Amoruso could work all hours of the day without even once checking the clock. Once you’ve figured out what you love to do, how can you succeed in doing it? Start by becoming an expert in your field, and learn everything you can. If you’re in the business world, the best way to gain expertise is through experience. For Amoruso, this meant building her own company from scratch. In the beginning, she did everything herself: bought the clothes, packed and shipped them to customers. This ensured that she knew the whole business, inside and out. And so when items didn’t sell, she would adjust her marketing approach, through changing text or images on her website. By being so adaptable, she gained lots of experience and knowledge about what exactly her customers wanted. During the first few years, Amoruso also styled all her own fashion shoots. In the process, she did much more than sell clothing; she offered young women an immersive, inspiring fashion experience. She did this by choosing approachable, cool-looking models and dressed them in a quirky way that her customers loved and wanted to copy. Ultimately, customers didn’t just connect with her product, they also connected with each other, creating a powerful community. This approach gave her fledgling business a major advantage over other vintage shops on eBay, many of which had dull photos and poor marketing. So when she moved from eBay to her own site, her community followed. And their loyalty didn’t end there. Her customers loved NastyGal so much they shared their find with friends. This word-of-mouth marketing helped Amoruso grow her customer base. By working hard and building experience, the author developed expert insight into what her customers wanted. But what really helped her succeed was that she was able to put all this expertise into building an influential, loyal community. There are no stupid questions. But there are questions that go unanswered because they were never asked in the first place. So if you want to do something, you have to start by asking for it. Think about it this way: If you don’t tell people what you want, you’re never going to get it. It’s simple! You have to vocalize your hopes and dreams if you want people to help you achieve them. Amoruso learned this one day when she was trapped on the side of the road during a heavy rainstorm. Although she didn’t have a dollar on her, she took a chance and held out her thumb to hitch a ride from a Greyhound bus. The bus stopped, and the driver let her ride for free. This lesson hit her like a lightening bolt: Ask, and you shall recieve. Another important aspect of getting what you want is trusting your intuition. That means knowing which rules are okay to break. After all, to build a successful business you have to be creative and break some rules. It’s not about seeing the world in black and white, but rather in shades of gray. Being more flexible in your thinking will also prevent you from worrying so much about whether you’re doing something right. Instead, break some rules, cross some lines – and make something new. Yet not all rules are meant to be broken. Amoruso learned this when she was busted for shoplifting. After paying a fine to avoid jail time, the author was humbled by her experience. She decided that the only rules worth breaking were arbitrary ones, like wearing last year’s shoes to a fashion party. So when it comes to breaking rules, don’t waste time by breaking the law. Unless you really feel like learning a different lesson in jail. So we’ve learned that there are some rules you can break, and others you can’t. But there’s also the Golden Rule: Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. Basically, this means if you put positivity out into the universe, you’ll receive the same in return. And what’s more, by focusing on what you like rather than what you don’t, you’ll free up energy that you can then pour back into your passions. Amoruso was tempted to ignore this advice when a friend copied the entire NastyGal website and tried to pass it off as her own. If the author had dwelled on this incident and stayed angry, it only would have helped her competitor, who would have used the opportunity to steal customers who weren’t getting the great customer service they were used to. But the author didn’t cave. She didn’t waste time plotting revenge, and instead rededicated herself to her business. As Amoruso learned, you can’t worry about what others are doing or thinking. If you spend your time obsessed with others, you’ll neglect the innovation and creativity inside of you. High school was miserable for the author. She was always paralyzed with fear by what others thought of her. So she left school early. Ultimately, she realized that worrying about what others think of you only wastes time and energy. So to stay focused and ignore the noise, create sigils. These are small words that are encoded with your goals. To make a sigil, jot down your goal in a word or short phrase and then slice it up, removing or combining whatever letters you want until you’re left with a pictogram no one else understands. These private codes can empower you to think positively about your dreams and stay motivated. Now that you know to stay positive and be true to yourself, how do you apply these skills to your entrepreneurial goals? The next blinks will show you how. When we’re children, creativity comes from paint sets, crayons and paper dress patterns. But as adults, we learn that problem-solving too is inherently creative. And when you combine creativity with business, you can set yourself apart. A creative entrepreneurial approach relies on questioning everything; in doing so, you create options for your business. Accepting the status quo will only limit you. For example, NastyGal does not heed the fashion-industry standard of thin, flat-chested models. The company rather established a reputation for creatively dressing different body shapes and marketing its products to women with curves. This innovative approach to styling wasn’t just a creative choice; for NastyGal, it was also a smart business decision that helped generate revenue. However, creative people sometimes get so swept up in the more imaginative aspects of their work that they ignore the more practical business side. It’s important to balance the two. While the author enjoyed thinking about the font on her website and the photographs she used to showcase her products, she also devoted plenty of energy and attention to acquiring and retaining customers. She always considered the shopping experience from her customer’s point of view, while making sure the aesthetics were consistent and unique across the site. Through this, she connected her entrepreneurial side with her more creative talents. Creative people can often be especially effective at marketing, so think of focusing your energies here. It’s a way of tapping your inner artist while also growing your business. Some people think that just because they’re a stylist (or some other creative type) that they can’t also be a businessperson. Thinking this way is negative, and almost guarantees that you will fail. As an entrepreneur, it’s important to choose the right team of employees and investors. But how? The best sort of team to work with is honest, hard-working and loyal. The author learned this one year when the NastyGal’s warehouse chief quit during the crucial Black Friday shopping period, leaving the warehouse in the lurch. Yet a number of motivated employees jumped in to help. They packed boxes, fulfilled orders and made sure the whole operation ran smoothly. They went above and beyond their job descriptions to make sure the company didn’t miss any customer orders during a critical time. For a CEO, a staff like this is a dream. Knowing that you can count on employees makes it easier to sleep at night. And meanwhile, as you and your team are hard at work, make sure your investors are supporting your efforts, and not undermining them. Investors are there to help you grow your dreams, not impose their own. As Amoruso personally experienced, some investors can be bullies. One potential investor, for example, asked the company’s male senior executives whether the author, as a woman, had trouble managing money. His small-mindedness was totally out of sync at a company like NastyGal. Especially one built from the ground up by a woman who’d never even taken out a business loan. Eventually, the author found investors who understood that she was starting a movement, not just a fluffy site for women to waste money. In the end, it’s important that you hold on to your principles and refuse to compromise, just for financial gain. Certain decisions might seem appealing in the short-term, but they’ll only cause problems in the long run. You know how some people have a glow? It’s all about confidence; when you feel good in your own skin, you look good too. This holds true both on a personal level and on a business level. If you know what you are as a company, you’ll be able to feel comfortable and confident following your own path. Otherwise, you’ll just get distracted by every new trend that springs up in your industry. With NastyGal, the author learned that it’s important to represent a business persona as a kind of girl who can talk to anyone, even a stranger. Maybe it would be more “cool” to seem aloof, as some competing brands do, but that kind of unfriendliness hints more instead to a lack of confidence. And as we all know, you can’t buy confidence. Sure, great clothes can help, but only if you have the smarts to back them up. This means listening when others are speaking and having the courage to form your own opinions. It also means knowing when to delegate a decision to someone with more expertise or experience. Never insist that you know everything, as it will only alienate. Instead, remain humble and confident. If you follow these suggestions, you’ll be naturally attractive to everyone you meet. And if you pair that with a fantastic dress? You’ll blow them away. The key message in this book: Becoming a successful entrepreneur isn’t about doing well in school, it’s about figuring out what you really love and letting your passion drive you. So if you want to succeed, ask for what you want and find a way to connect your entrepreneurial side with your creative talents. Most importantly, be confident! Actionable advice: Create a sigil, or a small word encoded with your goals. Lost sight of your goals and need a boost to get back on track? Write down one of your dreams in a word or short phrase and then literally slice it up, removing or combining whatever letters you want until you’re left with a pictogram no one else can understand. This small, private code will empower you to think positively about your dreams and stay motivated. Suggested further reading: Nice Girls Don’t Get the Corner Office by Lois P.

Harter, PhD","summary":"We’ve all been there: it’s seven o’clock in the morning and time to get up, shower and head to work. But how motivated are you? Whether you write novels, take care of patients as a doctor or therapist or work as a manager in an office, there always comes a time when the motivation to work seems to have run out. Sometimes it doesn’t even happen to you – but to your employees. And you have to watch them wallow in misery, their performance gradually getting worse and worse until they finally make enough mistakes that you can justify firing them. But that doesn’t boost your motivation either, right? So how can you manage to increase not only your own motivation but also that of your employees? Gallup, Inc. wondered the same thing and, after taking data from thousands of surveys, found an answer: there are 12 elements to great management. In these blinks, we'll explore the most important ones. We’ll also discuss why motivated employees create more profit for companies; what really motivates employees; and why team spirit is more important than hierarchies. Talk to any manager and they’ll tell you that one of the hardest parts of the job is keeping all of their employees happy and productive. To help identify the best management techniques, and the reasons they work so well, Gallup, Inc. conducted millions of surveys with managers and employees. The following information is the result of years of work investigating what really motivates employees. One of the most significant and apparent findings is that happy employees are good for business. They show up to work more often and they’re less prone to quitting, all of which saves the employer time and money. More precisely, employees who were positive about their work had a 27-percent higher attendance rate than others. These are the people you want on your payroll. Otherwise, you’ll be paying the same for less time spent at work, which is, of course, bad for business. The data also showed that unhappy or disengaged employees are 31 percent more likely to quit their job, and that finding a suitable replacement costs significant time and money – especially when the position requires highly specialized skills. So if you lose a chemical engineer or an elevator mechanic – people with unique talents – it’ll be difficult and costly to find a replacement. Perhaps more surprising is that happy employees are also less likely to have accidents on the job. Many jobs come with the risk of injury. If you work for a shipping company, for instance, you might get hurt loading a truck. What makes happy workers less prone to injury is their engagement and focus. Since they like what they’re doing, they pay attention to it. And that means they’re less likely to get careless. Gallup found that those in the bottom quarter of the happiness index suffered 62 percent more injuries than those in the top quarter. Clearly, it’s mutually beneficial for both employees and companies to have a work environment that promotes happiness. In the blinks that follow, we’ll take a closer look at how to foster such an environment. If you’re hiring someone to build your house, you’d want to be sure of two things: that they have all the tools they’ll need and that they understand exactly what is expected of them. If they lack equipment or understanding, you might end up with a log cabin instead of your desired stucco villa. The same is true in organizations. One significant piece of data showed that only 50 percent of employees strongly agreed with the statement, “I know what’s expected of me.” But when a company’s employees scored higher on this question, they also turned out to be 5- to 10-percent more productive. Employees also benefit from knowing exactly how their jobs fit in with those of other people in the company and what they can expect from others. This is illustrated by the work of management experts Robert Huckman and Gary Pisano, who in 2005 discovered that surgeons who work at multiple locations do their best work at the hospital where they spend the most time overall. This was attributed to the fact that at these hospitals, the surgeons were familiar with the staff and knew exactly what they could expect from each person, for instance knowing which residents would provide the most accurate patient data. Another key to happy employees is making sure they know precisely how their work contributes to the company’s goals. This was a big problem at the Winegardner & Hammons Hotel in Dallas. When Nancy Sorrells was hired to help get the business back on track, she discovered that no one understood how his or her job fit into the overall success of the company. To remedy this situation, she went over the company’s mission statement with the employees to help them understand how their individual roles could help provide a great experience for every guest. With this in mind, receptionists could see that there was more they could do to accommodate guests than just handing them a room key. As a result, everyone became more motivated – and a few months later, the hotel scored 95 out of 100 points in an inspection! If your parents wanted you to clean your room when you were a child, they might have tried using a reward to motivate you. Maybe they said they’d take you out for ice-cream if you did a good job. Believe it or not, incentives like this are effective in adulthood, too – and especially in the workplace. But, rather than offering sweet treats, a good manager will offer sweet words. In fact, when employees receive regular praise, productivity and revenue generally increase by 10 to 20 percent. So don’t underestimate the power of giving employees recognition; it’s a simple way to make them much happier. Most people find praise pleasant. An employee’ brain will release dopamine – which triggers feelings of satisfaction and happiness – when he hears kind words. This release also creates the urge to recapture this feeling, and this goal will keep the employee working at his best. This chemical process also explains why some people lose motivation. When there’s a lack of dopamine associated with work, there’s less reason to perform a task or to put in anything more than the minimum amount of effort required to get it done. And employees who feel their work is not rewarded or recognized are twice as likely to quit during the next year as those who do feel appreciated. However, praise should be doled out prudently. It can lead to jealousy and resentment, so it’s important for managers to deliver praise in one-on-one situations. Companies often make the mistake of praising employees in team meetings, which can backfire in ways that manager Elżbieta Górska is all too familiar with. In 2002, she oversaw the warehouse team at the International Paper Company in Poland, where many employees were only familiar with the procedures of the times when the state owned the business and everyone just received orders and no compliments were given. During a team meeting, Górska made the mistake of praising four employees and creating an atmosphere of jealousy that broke the team spirit. Górska realized her error and fixed it by setting up one-on-one meetings every week where she could listen to employee concerns and give individuals recognition for work well done. As humanity has developed as a species, we’ve transitioned into a more city-based economy. But this doesn’t mean we aren’t still drawn to the benefits of a tight-knit community. This is why another step toward employee satisfaction is to make them feel as though they’re part of a tribe. This means forming a cohesive team of coworkers, giving them shared goals to work toward and prioritizing employee interests. Employees are happy to be a member of a tribe because it means they’re part of a network of individuals who care for each other, a state of affairs that historically has provided an evolutionary advantage. It’s been shown that those who were sociable and remained part of a tribe were more likely to survive and flourish, since jobs like hunting and farming became much easier when more people were involved. And all the attributes of a tribal community can be found in a modern company: there’s a shared language and wardrobe, there are territorial boundaries and there’s a manager who acts as a sort of tribal leader. However, to take advantage of an employee’s desire to be part of a community, a manager needs to reinforce her role as the tribal leader by showing genuine interest in her employees. This was how Larry Walters was able to turn around the disastrous conditions at Qwest’s call center in Idaho Falls. When he was hired as a manager in 2003, employees were unmotivated and delivering poor results, which was partly due to the other managers’ impersonal approach to leadership. To get things on the right path, Walters went in the opposite direction – instead of just focusing on numbers, he learned the names of every employee, got to know their interests and asked them how their kids were doing in school. Like a football coach, Walters fostered a positive team spirit and practiced daily affirmations by placing signs in the middle of the call center proclaiming things like “You’re all rock stars!” The employees soon felt more committed and motivated. They wanted to impress their new leader because, in his eyes, each of them was much more than a mere cog in the machine. Being part of a team isn’t all camaraderie and praise; it can also lead to tiresome conflict – and this is why some managers think it’s easier for everyone to just put their heads down and follow orders rather than working together. Let’s call this the “scientific approach” to management. It’s an outdated, often frustrating and demotivating approach which many large organizations still adhere to. The man to blame for this is Frederick Winslow Taylor, who helped businesses thrive during the industrial revolution. To make labor more efficient, Taylor devised a way to improve employee performance by delegating all planning and thinking work to managers who supervised and controlled the workflow. In this model, employees had no reason to question anything – all they needed to do was show up and do what they’re told. This approach may have increased productivity at the time, but it also created a workforce that followed orders like a horde of mindless robots and was controlled by managers whose sole interest was meeting production quotas. But, of course, employees are not mindless robots – they are human beings. And they’re naturally motivated and productive when they have the chance to work on projects that they have had a hand in developing. Knowing this can make problem-solving in the workplace much smoother. Just consider the following example: In 2001, a children’s hospital in Toronto was facing a reduction in their MRI budget. This meant they had to find a way to work more quickly while still getting quality images. A standoff followed: Technicians proposed sedating children so that they’d remain still and reduce the number of times the MRI would need to be retaken due to movement. But nurses didn’t like this proposal; to them, unnecessary sedation seemed like a dangerous solution. Manager Susan Jewell solved the problem by setting up a day-long meeting where representatives of both teams could think about a solution that everyone could agree on. This way, the nurses felt like they were involved in the process, and, when they understood that they were being entrusted with the responsibility to decide which children wouldn’t need sedation, the plan to sedate went through. Which would you rather do: Work on a product that generates profit for a corporation, or one that helps children learn? The second proposition probably sounds better and more meaningful, yet these two company goals aren’t necessarily mutually exclusive. Often all that’s needed is a change in perspective, and this is another important part of making sure employees are satisfied with their work. Once we humans have our basic needs for food and shelter taken care of, our minds begin searching for ways to fulfill our higher needs, such as finding a purpose in life. Why humans have this kind of self-awareness is still a mystery, but it is clearly there. In a 1990 Gallup poll, 1,657 Americans were asked to rate how important it is for life to have meaning, and 83 percent gave the highest rating of “very important.” When a company taps into the happiness provided by a worthwhile purpose, they can reap major rewards. Companies were found to be 5- to 15-percent more profitable when they had employees who gave the most positive responses to the statement, “The mission or purpose of my company makes me feel my job is important.” But it takes the right managers to give employees the proper perspective on their work. A new tablet device could be seen as just another cash grab by a greedy corporation, but when it’s framed in the right way, it can be a humanitarian effort to provide children with better access to education. This is why a company needs to lay out meaningful goals in their mission statement, and then hire managers who can convince their employees of that mission’s merit. The mission statement of Cabela’s, a successful outdoor-equipment company, reads: “We passionately serve people who enjoy the outdoor lifestyle by delivering innovation, quality and value in our products and services.” Part of Cabela’s success is thanks to the fact that 60 percent of their employees strongly agree with this meaningful goal. And this is due to Cabela’s managers, all of whom are passionate about an outdoor lifestyle and make sure the company hires employees with similar passions. The very fact that you’re engaged with these blinks right now probably means that you have a desire to learn exciting new facts about the world around you. Maybe you even like mastering new skills, like cooking, coding or speaking Hindi. This desire to develop and grow is another natural urge for the human mind. In our first twenty years of life, it’s what drives us to learn how to walk, write, read, ride a bike and so on, without needing an external reward to motivate us. In our very first years, our brains are growing rapidly by the day. At school, our knowledge progresses more and more each year. But this desire to learn doesn’t just stop completely when we finish our schooling. Experts believe that looking forward to further development in life is hardwired into our nature. The influential American psychologist Abraham Maslow believed that continued development was of the utmost importance to human beings, which is why he put “self-actualization” – or the fulfillment of one’s potential – at the top of his hierarchy of needs. Naturally, the desire to continue developing extends to the workplace. It even factors into the meaning of the word “career,” which is defined thusly: “professional progress: somebody’s progress in a chosen profession or during that person’s working life.” In short, a developing employee is a happy employee who will be motivated to do better work. This is evidenced by the fact that businesses tended to outperform other companies by 10 percent when their employees strongly agreed with the statement, “This last year, I have had opportunities at work to learn and grow.” And a good manager should make sure her employees know the ways in which they can develop their skills. Research shows that having a strong interest in something is directly related to higher brain activity in the areas responsible for both concentration and happiness, both of which are crucial to delivering good work. So don’t forget: There are fundamentally human reasons why happy employees are the best employees a company could hope for. The key message in this book: Many companies still fail to recognize the fact that satisfied and motivated employees can have a significant positive impact on corporate performance. These companies need to learn how to motivate their employees, or they’ll find themselves fighting a losing battle in the marketplace. Actionable advice Make sure that your employees have the equipment they need. If people are allowed to explain what they need to do their jobs correctly, they will feel more valued and motivated. So you should always listen to your employees when they describe what materials they need, and ensure they get them. Otherwise, you run the risk of fueling frustration about not being able to perform their duties, which can lead to frustration about the job and workplace in general. Got feedback?

Maxwell","summary":"Have you ever worked for a boss who thinks that having the word “manager” in his job title automatically makes him an excellent leader? If you have, you’ll know that such people are usually the most incompetent leaders imaginable. The best leaders recognize that a position of authority is just one step on the path to becoming a great leader, and these blinks will show you all five steps anyone can take to become the type of leader people willingly follow. In these blinks you’ll learn what the US Marine Corps can teach you about leadership; why you should become a flock of geese rather than a herd of buffalo; and how you can leave a legacy. If you’ve ever had the pleasure of working under a great boss, you already know that having an inspiring leader can make a world of difference. Great leaders have the vision – that is, the ability to navigate a dynamic, fast-changing business world. A modern company is like a sailboat on a stormy sea. Like the captain, the leader knows how to navigate the stormy waters and chart the course to get to where you’re going. After all, the steering wheel and sails can be operated by anyone on-board, as long as there’s a leader to set the right course. As you can see, having a visionary, forward-thinking leader is crucial. However, it may surprise you to learn that these kinds of leaders are made, not born. Pretty much anyone can be appointed to a leadership position. But that doesn’t automatically give them influence or sway over other people. We’ve all experienced bosses who seem to think that their rank allows them to do anything they please, but leaders like that never manage to motivate their team or achieve the desired results. On the other hand, influential leaders know how to reach the right people, develop a good strategy and get things moving. And as we’ll see in the following blinks, there are five distinct levels you have to pass in order to become that kind of effective leader. It’s important to note that learning these leadership skills is like climbing a ladder: you have to master each step before you can climb higher. So keep reading to find out how to climb the leadership ladder and become a truly inspiring boss. Have you ever had a boss with lots of formal authority but no actual talent for leadership? If so, you’ve experienced a positional leader: someone at level one of the leadership ladder, who thinks position alone gives them the power to command. Unfortunately, positional leaders waste energy and fail to get the best out of their subordinates. After all, when formal position is the only thing legitimizing your leadership, you have to spend all your time defending your authority. In fact, we often see positional leaders behaving like medieval rulers, obsessed with accumulating huge armies and castles to buttress their power. In real-world terms, imagine a manager obsessed with attaining the largest possible staff and the biggest budget all in order to make themselves look important. Exacerbating the poor leadership, positional leaders have trouble giving their employees direction. They may order people around, but the subordinates will do only what is specifically expected, and very little more. The lesson here is that instead of seeing a leadership position as your only goal, you should see it as a starting point. It’s a chance to develop your own way of leadership and create lasting influence. Here’s another way to think about it: Although you may have a defined position within the company, you still have to fill it with life by choosing core values and deciding to implement specific working practices. Ultimately, you can develop any kind of leadership style, as long as it’s effective and true to who you are. The former CEO of Southwest Airlines learned this lesson while observing the behavior of two court litigators. One was very diplomatic and calm; the other was aggressive and emotional. But despite the difference in style, both were outstandingly successful. He realized that you have to bring your own personality to the position. As we’ve learned, positional leaders waste energy protecting their own interests and power. The best way to break free from this type of leadership is by shifting focus from ourselves to others. The advantages of being more outward-facing are manifold: positive relationships and a pleasant environment raise energy levels and foster an enjoyable workplace. Consider what happens when you spend time with people you don’t like. Most likely, it drains your energy and feeds a negative outlook. On the contrary, spending time with friends is like recharging your batteries – it makes us feel energetic and full of life! So, how do you build up these positive relationships? You need to get people’s permission to lead them. This is the next step on the managerial ladder. You have to value the people around you and treat them accordingly. You’ll find that if you practice a positive mode of communication, you’ll connect with others easily. To that end, imagine commanding a co-worker in an aggressive way; he’ll probably respond defensively. On the other hand, if you stay calm and gently ask for a favor, he’ll probably be open to your message, making it more impactful. This kind of communication is crucial, because when people around you trust you and feel appreciated, they tacitly give you permission to lead them. In other words, people cling to leaders they can trust. Especially when your workplace is dealing with difficult situations, feeling that someone’s looking out for everyone on the team strengthens ties. For instance, at the U.S. Marines, one of the core values is to leave no one behind, regardless of status. That’s why when they go into combat, officers waive their insignias of rank. Not wearing this symbol sends a clear message: we are in this together; we live and die together, regardless of rank. And this ethos plays a key role in the organization’s imposing reputation. Though getting your subordinates’ permission to lead them is important, in most companies leaders are only measured by the outcome of their leadership. This is why level three of the leadership ladder is the ability to produce results. And for any leader, the best way to produce results is to build an effective team. But how is this done? First, it’s important to recognize that an effective team isn’t simply a collection of individuals. Rather it’s a finely-calibrated balance of various skills and attributes. In other words, a good team is greater than the sum of its parts, because all the strengths are fused together to balance out the weaknesses. For instance, think of a basketball team, which consists of specialized players each perfectly fulfilling the demands of their specific position, whether dunking or shooting three-pointers. Members play in their own unique sweet spot, thereby maximizing strengths and minimizing weaknesses.   This kind of collaborative action is also well-suited to solving complex problems. Or as basketball coach John Wooden said, “Everyone who scores a basket has ten hands.” Meaning, each time an individual player scores, it’s thanks to his teammates’ contributions. But of course, every good team needs a good leader, someone who ensures that everyone’s working together and heading in the right direction. And that leader is also responsible for identifying strengths and weaknesses to compose the team. Bringing back the basketball analogy, you have to put your best defensive players in defense and the best attackers in offense. Furthermore, it’s crucial for the team that the leader never loses sight of the big picture and charts a course towards the final destination. Even in sports, the final goal isn’t always obvious. Just as in business, succeeding at basketball is way more complex than just “winning the game.” The coach has to also ask herself how she can prevent the team from overexertion, to save some energy for upcoming tournaments? In the business world, leaders have to ask the same questions. There’s more to producing results than building the right team. As a leader, you must also lead by example. If you perform aggressively or reluctantly, this attitude will translate into poor team performance. But if you show enthusiasm and drive, people will follow suit. For example, legend has it that once during the Revolutionary War, George Washington rode up to a group of soldiers who were having trouble raising a beam. Instead of helping directly, the commander first stood aside and shouted words of encouragement. But when he realized that the task exceeded the soldiers’ strength, Washington dismounted his horse and joined the struggle. Soon enough, the group succeeded in lifting the beam. But there’s one thing that’s even more important than inspiring people through your own actions: capitalizing on your victories to build momentum. Producing positive results is uplifting, and it will motivate your team to produce even better results.  As essayist Thomas Carlyle said: “Nothing builds self-esteem and self-confidence like accomplishment.” This virtuous cycle allows you to build up momentum in your team, and momentum is every leader’s best friend, for it amplifies good results and nullifies bad ones. Just think if Apple, for example. For years it was a niche company struggling to make inroads against the market leaders IBM and Microsoft. But thanks to products like the iPhone, it managed to turn the tide. Since then, it seems the company can do no wrong: nearly every move it has made has been lauded. This is thanks to the tremendous wave of momentum it has been riding: success begets success. One key challenge all leaders face is today's ever-changing business-environment. What works now may no longer work next year, so attaining sustainable, long-term success is very challenging. What can you as a leader do about it? Simple: remember that any company’s greatest resource is its people. After all, markets change, facilities deteriorate, supplies get used up, but people have the potential to grow and surpass themselves. And that’s exactly why successful companies focus on improving their people – that is, giving them room to learn and grow. In 1999, Fortune named Synovus Financial Corporation the best place to work in America. And looking back, the former CEO says that the award was only possible because the company always emphasized team-building and people development. A true leader is like a mentor, and this is reflected in the next step of the leadership ladder; focusing on transforming the people around him, the leader will help them grow. To this end, people development is one of the most important aspects of leadership. For example, the author observed that transformative leaders only put 20 percent of their effort in personal productivity; expending the other 80 percent on staff development. Meaning, great leaders put their own advancement far behind the broader goal of building a phenomenal team. It’s important to note that personal development isn’t just good for the company; it’s also a major human need. Fulfilling it will give your employees a sense of loyalty to the company, reducing possible interest in seeking opportunities elsewhere. As we’ve learned, people development is extremely important for the long-term success of an organization. And as a mentor, you have to find the balance between teaching your employees and empowering them to grow on their own. As you’ll see in the next blink, that means you have to put some power in their hands. Becoming a successful leader is a long process, but the rewards are great. Still, the journey never really ends. Because a true leader keeps giving back by teaching others to become leaders, too. There are a few reasons why this is important. Firstly, having just one leader creates an organizational bottleneck. In other words, when just one person makes all the decisions, the rest of the company becomes passive and dependent. The authors even compare traditional leadership models to a herd of buffaloes. Instead of blindly following a head buffalo, truly effective organizations are organized like a flock of geese, flying in a V formation and continually rotating who is at the head to oppose the wind. Another reason having just one leader doesn’t make sense: when that person quits, how can anyone else be ready to take on the load? Before that time comes, it’s crucial to create a culture of leadership within the organization and empower team members to become leaders themselves. How? Simply include them in the managerial process, allowing them to partake in key decisions. This allows them to develop their own leadership skills. Developing future leaders is not only an organizational necessity; it’s also the final step in the ladder; the pinnacle of all you do: creating fellow leaders who can act autonomously and also rear their own new leaders will effectively reproduce your work to infinity. Consider Socrates’ model. The Ancient Greek philosopher’s student, Plato, founded an academy that passed on knowledge to generations of students. Among these students was Aristotle, who later became an important mentor of Alexander the Great. Leaders crafted future leaders. And, there’s one more important benefit of teaching others: seeing other people grow and follow in your footsteps is greatly rewarding. In fact, it's the greatest source of personal fulfillment there is!   The key message: A true leader isn’t characterized by her formal job description, but rather by her influence on other people. To have the greatest impact as a leader, support your staff, build effective teams and allow people to grow and become leaders themselves.  Actionable advice: Listen carefully to how your employees are doing. In our daily lives when most of us ask, “How are you?” we don't really pay attention to the response. As a leader, you need to change this. In order to establish a connection to the people you work with, try to really listen to their answers: Watch the other person’s body language to try to gauge how they’re feeling; be genuine to establish a new level of understanding and nurture trust. Suggested further reading: The Effective Executive by Peter Drucker In The Effective Executive, author Peter Drucker offers a step-by-step guide to becoming a more productive and effective executive. By mastering a few procedures and principles, you can develop your own capacities as a leader and also support your employees’ strengths, with the goal of improving results across your organization.

Dialogue, he believed, reflects the way great ideas first emerge: through a kind of verbal sparring match, each contestant clarifies and improves on what the other has just said. At its best, communication can be open, receptive and constantly moving toward a shared understanding. If you’ve had a row with your partner or been in a meeting recently, you’ll know that communication in the real world can fall significantly short of this ideal. It’s all too easy to get bogged down in your own way of seeing things, to stop listening to others and to start repeating yourself. So what’s going wrong? Well, Jeremie Kubicek and Steve Cockram believe they’ve found the cause of all this unnecessary strife: if you don’t understand how to talk to others, it’s likely because you haven’t realized that everyone uses different “voices.” Individuals switch between multiple voices, but usually fall back on one dominant voice. Getting to grips with the communicative advantages and disadvantages of each of these unique voices, makes us more mindful about when to use one and refrain from using another. And that makes both workplace and personal conversations much more productive and rewarding. In these blinks, you’ll learn: how to identify the five different voices; when to give way and when to hold your ground in a verbal contest; and how to encourage those who usually stay quiet to speak up. When it comes to communication, the authors identify five different “voices” we all use. We switch between them depending on the situations we find ourselves in, but most of us fall back on a single dominant voice – our primary means of self-expression. So what are these voices? Well, say you’re someone who values the input of others and emphasizes group harmony: your predominant voice is that of a nurturer. Nurturers go out of their way to look out for those around them. They often put others’ needs ahead of their own and are most comfortable in environments where kindness and shared values come first. Nurturers are firmly anchored in the present: they want to take action now to ensure that relationships and the companies they work for flourish in the future. Nurturers also tend to believe that people are more important than profits. A nurturing manager, for example, will put in extra hours to talk to employees and make sure that they’re happy with their work, feel motivated and have everything they need to do their jobs well. Outside work, a nurturer is the kind of person who’ll cancel his own plans to help a friend move into a new apartment. That all sounds positive, right? It is, but nurturing types often run into a problem: they struggle to make themselves heard. This can have a big knock-on effect in organizations – after all, nurturers will keep their eyes on the wellbeing of people when everyone else is scrambling to meet targets. Without them, companies risk embracing a dog-eat-dog ethos that’s bound to undermine morale in the long run. But because they’re modest by nature, nurturers often undervalue their own contributions and end up keeping their heads down rather than speaking up. And here’s a crazy thing: according to the authors’ calculations, around 43 percent of the population is made up of nurturers. That’s a huge number of people who aren’t having their concerns taken seriously! We’ll explore what can be done about this later on. But before that, let’s take a closer look at the second voice. What’s your dominant voice? Let’s find out. If you’re highly imaginative, always looking to the future and daydreaming about the next big invention or business idea, chances are you’re a creative. This is the voice of innovation and change. You’ll find creatives in every walk of life. The mind behind the Post-it Note is a creative. So are artists, engineers and hobbyists tinkering in garages or coming up with new ways to insulate buildings. What they all have in common is that they’re interested in answering old questions in new ways, and set on redefining the questions being asked. The authors estimate that creatives are a pretty rare species: by their calculations, just nine percent of the population falls into this category. Creatives tend to gravitate toward organizations and institutions that reward out-of-the-box thinking – areas like academia, technology, the arts and the nonprofit sector. Working with creatives can be both intensely rewarding and supremely frustrating for other personality types. That’s because there’s a thin line between the brilliantly innovative and the downright unrealistic. But that’s not the only issue: creatives also struggle to make others understand their ideas. Why? Well, creativity is about inspiration and serendipity, and thus can be pretty messy. When creatives attempt to explain their thought processes to the more logically minded, their insights will often leave their audience cold or confused. That’s a painful experience for creatives and it often leads to them retreating into their shells. Take Paul, a graphic designer who worked with the authors. When he pitched his ideas for a branding campaign, he was met with a wall of silence. A week later, another team member pitched almost the exact same idea with greater clarity and charisma, and the team loved it. Few experiences are more likely to undermine the self-confidence of a creative! The best way to avoid such situations is for creatives to pay more attention to the way they communicate their ideas, and for non-creatives to make an effort to show that they value creative contributions. If you mapped different voices onto political beliefs, guardians would undoubtedly be conservatives. Whether you regard conservatism as a hidebound defense of old evils or a necessary bulwark against new ones, there’s no disputing that it’s an important voice in society. So what exactly do guardians stand for? Well, as the name suggests, their primary aim is to protect the tried and tested ways of doing things. Like nurturers, guardians are focused on the present. Their motivation isn’t to protect the interests of people, however, but to prevent what they see as unnecessary change. That’s because they see more positives than negatives in the current system, and emphasize its successes rather than its shortcomings. Like conservatives, guardians often get a bad press. In an age that cherishes openness and innovation, guardians are likely to come across as boring and restrictive. As a result, they’re often underestimated. Lots of people regard arguing in favor of the status quo as the least sophisticated position, and thus conclude that those who do so can’t be all that clever! This dismissive view tends to overlook the fact that guardians usually have very good reasons for defending the present order. Guardians are also defined by their pragmatism and realism – qualities that allow them to quickly identify the drawbacks of new ideas. By rejecting overly ambitious and unfeasible schemes, guardians often end up saving organizations huge amounts of time, energy and money that might otherwise have been squandered on dead-end projects. That also goes for deals and opportunities that seem too good to be true. If your company is presented with an offer for cut-price magic beans, you can be sure that the guardians will be doing the due diligence on precisely what riches the beans are likely to yield over the next quarter. Boring they may be, but guardians are frequently all that stands between an organization and the kind of reckless, impulsive decisions that can undo years of good work in a single day! Imagine throwing a party and inviting people from the different areas of your life – your friends, family, colleagues and neighbors. It might be tricky to get everyone on the same page and feeling comfortable around each other, right? Well, it’s in such situations that connectors come into their own. These are the people who effortlessly bring individuals together, and who can get on with strangers as if they’ve known them for years. You can spot a connector by a couple of telltale signs. If there’s a problem in the office, a connector will reach out to a peer who’s well placed to resolve the issue quickly and efficiently. Connecters also tend to be generous with their contacts. If you’re looking for a new job and a connector knows someone who’s hiring, she’ll almost certainly put the two of you in touch. The downside of having such brilliant people skills is that it’s easy to end up with lots of acquaintances but few true friends – the most common drawback of being a social butterfly.   That said, connectors thrive in more formal settings like the workplace. In fact, they’re invaluable additions to any team or company. This stands to reason: they’re invariably excellent motivators and are infectiously enthusiastic about virtually every activity. And if they’re fascinated by something or find it rewarding, they won’t keep it to themselves. A connector who suddenly discovers a love of Nordic walking will soon have the rest of her team stomping around in the countryside with her! All these traits boil down to one thing: connectors cherish collaboration, and will always go out of their way to get everyone involved and having fun in the workplace. This makes them a great asset to any organization that relies on teamwork. Some people are simply impossible to argue with. It’s not necessarily that they have the loudest voices – though they often do – so much as the fact that there’s no budging them from their position. Whether they’re right or wrong, they’ll argue their case with such conviction that countering them is like trying to turn back the tide. If that rings a bell, there’s a good chance you know a pioneer! If pioneers are stubborn, it’s because they’re strategic thinkers who have a very strong and clear vision of their personal and professional goals. Getting in the way of this is like stepping onto the tracks in front of a freight train: you’re going to get flattened. Their other defining trait is ambition. Pioneers don’t open a mere coffee shop or burger joint – they envisage their modest enterprise as the first step toward a globe-spanning commercial empire as ubiquitous and successful as Starbucks or McDonald’s! Those intent on achieving fame and fortune should be prepared to make some tough calls, and that’s just what pioneers do. As they see it, work is simultaneously a game and a winner-takes-all battle. Whatever the objective, pioneers are in it to win it by any means necessary. As in chess, pawns sometimes have to be sacrificed to secure long-term objectives. Take it from Jane Fardon, the English CEO of a struggling cosmetics business. A recession had undermined the company to such an extent that, from a financial point of view at least, the only sensible decision was to shutter the operation. But remember what we said about everyone having multiple voices? Well, Jane’s inner nurturer was telling her to hold out – after all, if she closed the business down her employees would be out of work. With the authors’ help, however, she realized that her strongest voice was her inner pioneer and that she should learn to trust that instinct. She dissolved the company and rebuilt her cosmetics empire from the ground up. Today, the new business is thriving and Jane has settled on a compromise to end the conflict between her pioneering and nurturing voices: while she makes the big strategic calls, the day-to-day running of the company is in the hands of trusted nurturers and guardians. By now you should have a good understanding of the five voices. But what happens when you bring them all together in one room? If you’ve been in a team meeting lately, you may already know the answer: the loudest people end up talking at cross purposes while the quiet types sit it out on the sidelines. But it doesn’t have to be that way. In the next couple of blinks, we’ll take a look at what you can do to improve each team member’s experience. Let’s start with nurturers. As we’ve seen, nurturers often undervalue their own contributions and rarely speak up. The key here is to explicitly encourage them to make themselves heard, and to rein in more vocal members when nurturers are talking. That’s important because the more opinions a nurturer hears before his own turn comes around, the less confident he’ll be about presenting his ideas. Start by taking a moment to convince a nurturer that his views really are valued. To do that, you’ll have to make it clear that you understand that his voice best expresses the concerns of the people who depend on your company, whether these be employees or customers. The next step is to have a word with other team members and tell them that criticism of the nurturer’s ideas is off-limits for the time being. You don’t want to wrap him in cotton wool, but it’s helpful to protect him as he becomes more confident. If his ideas really aren’t feasible, keep your critique factual, and make a solid case explaining why the ideas won’t work, rather than getting personal. Next up: creatives. Here you’ll need to redefine the creative’s role to give her free rein to think outside the box. To do that, you’ll have to first accept that the craziest ideas can lead to something brilliant if they’re given time and careful consideration, so you should resist the urge to reject them outright. Finally, you’ll need to learn to live with the fact that some ideas will be duds – just think of them as rough sketches leading toward that masterpiece! Explaining this to other team members and asking them to refrain from strong criticism, and to instead pose clarifying, constructive questions, should help speed the process along. So far we’ve looked at how to encourage the quieter voices in your team to share their ideas and insights. Now it’s time to explore how to manage the more boisterous types, starting with guardians.   As we know, guardians are skeptical about change. While others might view them as a nuisance, they see their tough questions as an essential part of a healthy company culture. And here’s the thing: they’re right. That means it’s your job to explain to other team members that guardians aren’t the enemy and that when they show up to meetings with reams of carefully structured notes and insist on going over every point in minuscule detail, it’s for the good of the organization.    So how do you do that? Well, it’s a good idea to remind other personality types of the dangers guardians are trying to protect the company from. After all, rushing headlong into poorly planned projects that are doomed to fail isn’t in the interest of anyone, including the creative types who may have proposed said projects!   This brings us to connectors. Here, it’s all about timing. Once the guardians are done with their forensic analysis and cross-examination, hand things over to the connectors and let them deploy their social skills to drum up enthusiasm and motivate the whole team. One last tip: connectors are usually highly emotional, so don’t forget to caution them against taking criticism too personally. Finally, there are the pioneers. You may have guessed that it’s a good idea to ask them to speak last because they tend to be the most dominant characters in a meeting. If they over-egg the pudding even after waiting for their turn, and jump in with overly harsh criticism of other members, remind them to keep things constructive and empathetic. Putting these tips into practice will help you keep the nurturers, creatives, guardians, connectors and pioneers in your organization working together as a team and bringing their ideas to the table. When a flight attendant runs through a plane’s safety features, he reminds you to secure your own oxygen mask before helping others, especially children. There’s a good reason for this: you’re not going to be of any use to anyone if you’re unconscious! Team leaders are in a similar position in the workplace – if they’re not in control of their own voices, it’s unlikely they’ll be able to help other team members control theirs. That’s why it’s so important to lead by example and remember that your voice is responsible for the team. Of course, it’s hard to keep track of your main voice when you’re getting bogged down in discussions that aren’t really your priority. The key is to focus on the attributes of your authentic voice.   If you’re a nurturer, try to keep your focus on representing a harmonious working environment and humane company values. If you’re a guardian, your goal should be to embody and safeguard the values of proven systems and traditions, not to mention fiscal conservatism! If you’re a creative, stay true to yourself by thinking outside the box, but be equally attentive to communicating your ideas as clearly as you can. If you’re a connector, make sure you’re facilitating open, clear dialogue between team members. Finally, if you’re a pioneer, your goal is to keep your eye on the strategic context and step up to the plate when difficult decisions need to be made. That doesn’t mean you should always use your most dominant voice. In fact, your “secondary voices” will often be sources of new insights. Take the author Steve Cockram. He’s naturally a pioneer, although he also has pronounced nurturing and guardian tendencies. Over time, he’s worked out that he performs best when spending around 70 percent of his time in pioneer mode to get the bulk of his strategic consulting work done, and switching to his other voices when it comes to tasks like editing books or checking legal contracts. So now you know all about the five different voices, what they stand for, and how to bring them together in team settings. Once you start applying this new knowledge at work and in your private life, you’ll be amazed how much easier communicating with even the most difficult people can be! The key message in these blinks: There are five different communicative styles or “voices.” These belong to five different character types – the nurturer, the creative, the guardian, the connector and the pioneer – which each have their role to play in group settings. Whether it’s a family or a company team, a group is at its best when each unique voice is given a chance to make itself heard and everyone feels that their views are being taken into account.  Actionable advice: Question ingrained biases against certain voices in your culture.  Different cultures do things differently. That’s a no-brainer, right? Well, like fish in water, we often fail to notice this precisely because it’s so obvious. The upshot is that certain voices hold greater sway than those that don’t mesh with dominant cultural norms. In a country that prizes rugged individualism, like the US, pioneering voices are much more likely to make themselves heard. In a country like Switzerland, by contrast, a preference for order and efficiency gives guardian voices an advantage in the workplace. That’s why it’s a great idea to take a step back and check if ingrained biases are marginalizing certain voices in your team. So ask yourself: are your American guardian colleagues getting a fair hearing? How about those Swiss pioneers? Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Despite progress in recent years, a certain stigma still surrounds them. It means people who have experiences with psychiatric illnesses are often unwilling to speak out. That’s unfortunate and, as far as Nassir Ghaemi is concerned, things don’t have to be that way. His approach is plain. If we look to the past, we can see that many of the world’s greatest leaders had mental health issues. If we accept and elevate that tendency, we can find a way to celebrate what can be the positive consequences of psychiatric illness. In the past, this taboo has meant that we preferred to support the representatives and leaders who seemed the most “normal.” But having depression or bipolar disorder, for example, may be an advantage when serving in office. As you’ll see in these blinks, some of the most impactful leaders in the world’s history personally experienced mental health issues. By looking at these leaders’ behavior, we can shed some light on the relationship between mental health and political leadership, challenging some of our deep-seated prejudices about this topic. In these blinks, you’ll learn: how hyperthymic personality disorder may have prevented nuclear war; why Tony Blair wasn’t as monomaniacal as he’s often portrayed; and into what surprising profession the prejudice against mental health reaches. Mental illness is serious. In its most extreme forms, it can be devastating for those who have it and their loved ones. Furthermore, a social taboo still surrounds mental illness. That may explain why some people experiencing mental illness are ashamed and try to hide it. However, the author believes that some forms of mental illness involve abilities that are otherwise inaccessible to the rest of the population. Specifically, the author has two mental illnesses in mind: major depressive disorder – commonly called depression – and bipolar disorder. They each foster important character traits. For instance, let’s consider someone who’s faced depression. Depression is a disorder that affects the mood and leads to feelings of sadness. It can also reduce motivation and interest in the world. However, it often means that someone who experiences it is more empathic than average since he’ll have experience and understanding of sadness. People who’ve not suffered from depression might be able to conceive of the experience of severe depression, but it’s not the same as having been through it. And if you’ve managed to come through it, then you may have a better grasp of the struggles of the human experience. Bipolar disorder is somewhat different. People who have it may rapidly oscillate in their moods between mania and depression. It can make them more spontaneous. However, those high levels of energy and heightened moods are balanced with deep lows of depression. Also – and we’ll return to these in later blinks – this means bipolar-disorder personalities often look at things from non-standard perspectives. They are able to imagine creative solutions to problems that someone who hasn’t experienced bipolar disorder would find hard to conceive. Both of these disorders also occur in “milder” forms. Dysthymic personality disorder is associated with depressive types, while hyperthymic personality disorder corresponds with bipolar disorder. People with dysthymic personalities lead their lives in a constant state of mild depression, which may culminate in several depressive episodes over the course of a lifetime. Dysthymic personalities are often empathic and deep thinkers. Hyperthymic personalities are often bursting with energy and creativity. They are charming and without fear. They are, essentially, in a constant state of mild mania. Now that we’ve gotten an overview of these disorders, let’s look at some of the most influential leaders of recent decades with dysthymic and hyperthymic personalities. In all likelihood, few people would suspect that two leaders who inspired – and continue to inspire – hope in millions of people were depressive characters. The author, Ghaemi, believes Mahatma Gandhi was a dysthymic personality, while Martin Luther King Jr. experienced at least three episodes of severe depression. Both of these leaders initially suffered periods of depression in childhood, which set a trend into adulthood. As it happens, both King and Gandhi attempted suicide at young ages. When Gandhi was a teenager, he deliberately ate some poisonous seeds with a friend. His rationale was that he wasn’t able to care properly for his elderly father. He felt guilty. As for King, he twice jumped out of a window when he was 12. King’s friend, the psychiatrist Alvin Poussaint, explained this behavior as merely an impulsive reaction to the death of King's grandmother. However, the author is firmly of the belief that these were real suicide attempts. The author sees similar behavior patterns in these two leaders’ later years. Apparently, depression was either triggered or exacerbated by the pressure in their lives. After all, both led rights movements that were faced with huge counter-reactions. When you think about it, then, these leaders probably felt great responsibility for their followers and were frustrated that obstacles seemed unsurpassable. Empathy can be observed as a neurological phenomenon – for example, when we see another person being abused, our brains react as though we were the ones on the receiving end of the abuse. It’s known as the mirror neuron system and has been seen in experiments on macaques. As we saw in the last blink, depression strengthens empathy. A study of college students showed that depression lets people feel what others feel more intensely, even when they’re not in a depressive episode. The author sees a link with King and Gandhi’s politics here, interpreting their politics as a form of “radical empathy.” In other words, both leaders advocated for love and understanding; opponents were not to be hated. The connection is clear for the author. These two leaders set about resolving conflict through non-violent means, but it was an approach that drew upon non-normative world views shaped by mental illness. In 1938, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain stood before the House of Commons to make an announcement. He would travel to Germany to meet Hitler in an attempt to convince him of the unnecessariness of war. MPs jumped up and cheered at the plan. But Winston Churchill remained seated, despite others rebuking him for not joining in. Churchill had his reasons. In 1930, long before anyone else in British government came to the same conclusion, Churchill had recognized the Nazis’ threat. They were a danger to world peace. In the author's professional opinion, Churchill likely had type II bipolar disorder. This resulted in several manic and depressive phases. Therefore, in the author’s eyes, Churchill’s depressive experience meant he was able to discern situations realistically. In comparison, his mentally healthy colleagues' optimism was misplaced. The thirty-fifth president of the United States, John F. Kennedy, is also an interesting figure. For the author, JFK exemplifies hyperthymic personality disorder. Simply put then, he was a hyperactive and creative risk-taker – with a sex drive to match. This was particularly in evidence during the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962. The Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev sent Russian nuclear missiles to Cuba to goad Kennedy into a pre-emptive strike – with atomic weapons. But Kennedy held firm. He ignored the advice of everyone around him. By doing so, he averted nuclear disaster. Other leaders who might not have had Kennedy’s experience with mental health struggles would probably have acted differently. No doubt they would have shared the natural impulse common among Kennedy’s advisers and ordered a preemptive attack. Adolf Hitler is another world leader worth considering when thinking about mental health. The author is certain that Hitler had bipolar disorder. But what really caused the evils he leveled on the world was his vile ideology mixed with an overreliance on methamphetamines. Certainly, Hitler suffered from bouts of mania and depression during his childhood. It’s thanks to his friend August Kubizek that we know this. Hitler had always had an aggressively megalomaniacal streak, but it was as a leader capable of manipulating the masses that he found his feet. The author even argues that his demagoguery might have been facilitated by his personality disorder. It’s also worth remembering that Hitler's aggressive and maniacal behavior went into overdrive from 1937 onward. That’s when his doctor started prescribing him methamphetamines. It’s quite possible that Hitler’s prolonged use of methamphetamines heightened his mental instability. Consequently, over time he became less and less likely to listen to the advice given to him by subordinates. His outbursts of violent rage also became more frequent. It’s fairly common for journalists and political commentators to start blaming politicians’ mental health when they don’t like their decisions and actions. That was very much the case with forty-third US President George W. Bush and Tony Blair, the UK prime minister from 1997 to 2007. Many people thought that their political decisions were indicative of mental instability. But as far as the author is concerned, their thought processes were fairly typical for mentally healthy minds. After 9/11, both leaders felt their countries were threatened. They wanted to act. It’s now clear that this impulse led them to invade Iraq on evidence that later proved extremely dubious. Let’s run a thought experiment here. What if these leaders had either hyperthymia or bipolar personalities? Both of these disorders are closely associated with higher creativity. Therefore, we may speculate that such leaders would have been able to see the unfolding situation from multiple perspectives. Such a leader might well have realized that the evidence was too insubstantial to support an invasion. He would have found another way forward, probably one inconceivable to less creative, mentally healthy types. Just think of Kennedy's response during the Cuban Missile Crisis for a comparison. Bush and Blair’s next move was also typical for the mentally healthy. Once their decision had been made, they found themselves unable to change course. They were simply unwilling to see that their assessment of the situation in Iraq had been wrong and that  the evidence on which they based their arguments for invasion was insubstantial. Even once it was clear that they hadn’t been successful, they refused to budge. The author is therefore of the opinion that Bush and Blair chose to keep troops in Iraq instead of acknowledging their mistakes. Such stubbornness is typical of those who are mentally healthy. So Bush and Blair were hardly exceptional – characteristically, most people just don’t like admitting they have ever been wrong. This thought experiment just goes to show that had the United Kingdom and the United States had leaders with more experience of mental illness, then the whole world might ultimately have benefited. In a hypothetical world, had Kennedy been president after 9/11 there would have been no Iraq invasion. Or, had there been an invasion, troops wouldn’t have been stationed there long once it was clear an error had been made. Despite the author’s sympathetic portrayal of mental illness, the fact remains that mental illness remains a taboo subject. There’s clear evidence that we, as a society, are scared of mental illness. A 2004 study published in the Psychiatric Bulletin showed that even medical professionals were prejudiced against people diagnosed with mental illnesses. This situation makes it incredibly difficult for someone faced with mental illness. It also makes it very tricky for non-sufferers to get a clear perspective on it. Specifically, the continuing stigma surrounding mental illness means we’re unable to see its upsides. The first thing we could do is simply acknowledge and accept that past world leaders weren’t always mentally healthy. That doesn’t mean we have to rewrite history. It’s just another layer of knowledge contributing to our picture of the past. Mentally ill people have contributed to make the world a better place. The examples we’ve looked at in these blinks barely scratch the surface. The author has also analyzed other renowned figures. For instance, Ted Turner, a pioneer of 24-hour cable news and the founder of CNN, experienced mental illness, as did President Abraham Lincoln. Turner displayed a hyperthymic personality type, while Lincoln was dysthymic. We should accept, then, that mental health isn’t just a question of “abnormal” types contrasted with seemingly normative behavior. That approach is typical of people who consider themselves mentally fit and distance themselves from anything that is marked as different. Once we’ve accepted that beloved historical figures were mentally unwell and started de-stigmatizing mental health, we can move onto the next step. In this changed atmosphere, more people will doubtless seek diagnosis and help. No longer will diagnosis be something to be ashamed of, but rather something with appreciable qualities. That analysis seemed true to the author as he wrote this book during the presidency of the forty-fourth US president, “No drama Obama”, as he is often known. At the time, an ideal president seemed to be someone who was balanced and “middle-of-the-road” – psychologically as well as politically. For the author, here’s where the rub lies. That sort of president might be effective in peaceful times, but what kind of leader is needed when times are rockier? To his mind, what’s needed is someone who can think differently, someone who’s an asset because of the mental health issues he’s experienced. Think of Churchill in World War Two or JFK in the teeth of the Cold War – the leaders you need in times of crisis. The key message in these blinks: Mental illness is not something of which to be ashamed. Although it’s true that living with a mental illness can be difficult, exhausting and upsetting for those affected and their loved ones, there is an upside. History shows us that some of the greatest world leaders were effective and unique because of their histories of mental health issues. It was precisely what was “wrong” with them that made them successful. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

The sad truth is that many employees feel completely disengaged from their workplace. They don’t feel motivated to do any more than the bare minimum required of them by their bosses. But if building a successful company is your goal, the bare minimum won’t cut it. You need employees who love and take responsibility for their work, and who seek their own approaches to making the company better – without your having to reward them with bonuses. In other words, you need a team of leaders. These blinks explain some quick and easy ways to encourage your employees to be more self-sufficient, as well as to stir up new inspiration and ideas at the office. In these blinks, you’ll discover why your team should constantly be learning new things; how to improve the design of your office; and one way to ensure your whole office is united by good purposes. Imagine you’re at the office and it’s midday. After 4 hours of typing and staring at a computer screen, how do you feel? In all likelihood, you’re bored stiff. You probably have moments when you’d like to forsake your computer and incite your coworkers to join you in revolutionizing the office. You’d like to be part of a team, not a hierarchy. You want to be a member of a team of leaders. But, as in most offices, your boss has all the decision-making power. What do you do? Well, your workplace may simply be in the first of five stages in the team development model. Stage one is that hierarchical model we’re used to; there’s one leader and a team of subordinates following orders. So how do you move past that stage? First, it’s important to know what the next stage looks like. Imagine an organization that’s agreed to strive toward developing a team of leaders. There’d no longer by one executive adjudicating on all work-related issues. Rather, every member of the team would have an equal say. This is the stage during which change really begins. The following stages are just the ideal consequences of that initial shift. Stage three, for instance, is when new leaders begin thinking about creating and taking responsibility for their own team, perhaps by recruiting new members. In stage four, the transition continues as more and more team members step up to the plate and take on leadership roles. For instance, instead of waiting for an assignment from your management, you’d approach HR yourself, learn the ropes and start selecting candidates to fill open positions. By stage five, the goal of completely shared leadership is realized, and each employee is filled with a greater sense of engagement. Because everyone now knows how to recruit people according to the company’s processes, each team is able to self-manage. Hold on – design? That verb might seem a little out of place here. We’re talking about businesses, not Eames chairs, right? Well, design actually has a major influence on many aspects of an organization, too. To get a better sense of this, consider the following questions: How many members does your team have? How should you implement interview procedures? How do you define a company’s mission? Fundamentally, these are all questions of design. So, then, what’s the ultimate goal of design? Simple: uniting people with a shared sense of purpose. We’d all want our job to be meaningful, to have a positive impact on the world: knowing that our work has meaning gives us more energy and more fulfillment. For example, when asked what they do, you want your employees answering purposefully, like “I improve the usability of a website!” instead of “I just fix bugs.” When they don’t feel connected to a higher purpose or believe their work has meaning, they’ll start channeling energy away from work. In addition to each individual’s sense of higher purpose, the team of leaders will thrive as a whole when united under a clearly communicated mission, such as “We support American veterans.” But a truly ingenious way of giving your team drive is to implement a team value creation model. This is an approach where your team operates as a mini-business, by providing team members with the incentive to access more information and a higher level of inside knowledge. Being your own mini-business boss, you might have insights into financial data – balance sheets, say – that allows you to track your team’s performance and engage them with it. This increased employee engagement will not only boost their satisfaction; it’ll boost customer satisfaction, too. How? See, customers usually benefit when an organization functions at a high level. When employees are more productive and better able to respond and update quickly, customers will want in on the action. So we now know that every leader in your team should have her own purpose. However, it’s also vital that these purposes allow team members to work with, not against, each other. In other words, you must achieve alignment among your team members. Alignment is how your team and its elements work together. To get a better idea of what alignment looks like, let’s consider an unaligned team. An organization says that they’re shifting focus to improving the quality of their products. But little attention is given to improving quality, and the focus remains on maximizing productivity. At management meetings, the focus is on the quantity of work, not the quality. And at the end of the year, bonuses are awarded to the teams that performed best, including one who scored, out of all the company’s teams, second-lowest in quality but highest in productivity. This unaligned situation only confirmed the employees’ suspicions that management didn’t really care about quality. The company’s senior executives eventually realized their mistake, but they had lost the employees’ trust and it took many years to make up for it. So, how to avoid this? By creating alignment.  Take the above example. The management should’ve aligned the teams toward making higher quality products: That means considering which principles would guide the teams’ focus toward improving quality, which strategies would improve quality, which specific projects or technologies were needed to optimize quality and which rewards would entice teams to produce at a higher quality. If everyone had striven for quality, all design and behavioral incentives would’ve been in accordance in the team. And that would’ve meant that everyone was working toward the same goal: shared success. You’ve probably heard that old saying “knowledge is power.” It’s more than just a cliché. In fact, it’s incredibly relevant when it comes to how your team functions. Every organization has organizational knowledge, that is, the sum of the knowledge belonging to each member within it. Organizational knowledge can also be broken down into key knowledge, which tells us how to create value for the customer; codifiable knowledge, referring to facts and routines in the company; and tacit knowledge, or beliefs and expertise. Let’s take a closer look at why organizational knowledge is vital, and how it works. Imagine you work in a call center with two other people, whom we’ll call Anton and Berta. Anton and Berta have key knowledge, but what happens when Anton and Berta are sick, and you receive a call from a customer named Tom, whose credit card has been stolen? Somewhere in your company handbook there’ll be a section on credit cards: codifiable knowledge that might help Tom. But nobody told you where to find it. And, if you’re unable to contact Anton and get his advice, your tacit knowledge – that you’re 99 percent sure Tom’s money is safe – is insufficient, and probably won’t make Tom feel any better, and he definitely won’t think too highly of your company. Clearly, there’s something wrong with this model. So instead of each team member hoarding a specific kind of knowledge, the goal should be for tacit, codifiable and key knowledge to be equally accessible to each team member in your company. How can you ensure this? The best way is to facilitate learning. Structured learning methods, like manuals, customer research and videos, help everyone access codifiable knowledge. On the other hand, unstructured learning methods, like storytelling, role-playing or personnel rotation, increase the exchange of tacit knowledge because experiences get shared. Have you ever had the unfortunate experience of working in a labyrinth of office cubicles under the harsh glare of fluorescent lighting? Many of us have, and it’s not the way it should be. A working space should double as a leader’s place, an environment that honors both your company’s mission and your customers’ feelings. To create a space that fosters a team of leaders, we’ll need something a little more powerful than interior decorating. It’s called visual management. So where do we begin? The first thing to consider is how to optimize the workplace so that ideas and inspirations can be exchanged. Rather than having separate rooms for each team member, why not create an open, yet close-knit layout. It could also help to have charts on the walls displaying current problems and possible solutions. Additionally, whiteboards illustrating the progress of individual projects will make team members feel appreciated and meaningful. In this way, visual management can boost the alignment of a team, too. A clever use of space will also allow you to send powerful messages to your customers. Displays outlining your mission can send positive signals: “This is how we perform and we like it!” And, even just a hand written sign displaying customer feedback makes every customer feel that they’re both welcomed and respected. The key message in this book: Your organization is just five steps away from becoming a team of leaders. Savvy team design, sharing of knowledge and strong visual management will smooth your transition to an aligned and enthusiastic team, united under a shared purpose. Actionable advice: Remember why you do, what you do!  If you’ve ever felt demotivated, just take a step back and reflect on how your individual contribution matters, not just to your team, but to the greater good that your company serves. Even if it doesn’t feel like it, your activities are meaningful, appreciated and important. Channeling these thoughts will keep you energized, happy and on track.

Our leaders have inflated egos. The market is a volatile place where ideas appear to sink or swim arbitrarily. It makes sense, then, that we’re bombarded with strategies on how to save the world, our business or ourselves. In reality, however, solutions to the complex problems of our world cannot be reduced to a simple “How To” guide. As Tim Harford’s best-selling Adapt shows, the most effective way to solve any problem is not by planning – it’s by experimenting. With these and more insights, Adapt suggests a great many ways to make oneself resilient against the kind of failure that stops you in your tracks. After reading these blinks, you’ll find out why rules designed to reduce fossil fuel usage actually ended up increasing it; discover why Winston Churchill was wrong about the Spitfire; and find out why one company allows its existing employees to choose the new hire. What’s the difference between the survival rate of biological organisms and that of companies? Not much, as it happens. No matter how competent companies and leaders appear, most of them fail to survive in the long term. In an analysis of the fossil record, economist Paul Ormerod found that the extinction rate of species over a time period of 500 million years matched the extinction rate of companies (albeit on a shorter timescale). To understand why only certain companies survived, Ormerod built a mathematical model of corporate evolution. In this model, Ormerod gave some companies random strategies; some a small advantage over these strategies; and made some of them perfect planners, able to use their knowledge of other companies to maximize their advantage. It turned out there was no overlap between the results of this managed model and a model that represented the actual company extinction rate. In other words, the survival of companies is not due to success or failure in strategic planning. This was also shown in another study, where economic historian Leslie Hannah tracked the world’s largest companies from 1912 onwards. In 1912, US Steel was the market leader, with over 200,000 employees. However, by the 1990s, the company was not even in the top 500. Although some of the companies studied did prosper over the decades – like Shell and General Electric – most of them vanished. And these forgotten companies were, in fact, the Googles and Walmarts of their time. So, since companies frequently appear and vanish, predictions about any company’s future must be treated with suspicion – even when they’re made by so-called experts. Over the course of 20 years, psychologist Philip Tetlock asked 300 experts for their forecasts of a variety of future events. These experts included diplomats, political scientists and economists, many with PhDs. Yet most of their predictions never came true – especially those concerning Russia’s political development from the Cold War to the collapse of the Soviet Union. Therefore, because we can’t predict whether or not a company (or any endeavor) will succeed or fail, it’s crucial that we learn to be resilient against inevitable failures. The following blinks will show you how to accomplish this. It might seem counterintuitive, but our most trusted organizational structures – such as the top-down model – continue to make a great number of mistakes. Why? The hierarchy for top-down decision-making effectively silences the dissenting opinions of experts – opinions that would help organizations to learn from their mistakes. The top-down model consists of three things: a high-level view compiled from all available information; an absolute chain of command; and a unified team sharing a unanimous vision. Top-down organizations’ propensity for making mistakes is especially clear in the army. During the second Gulf War in Iraq, for example, military knowledge acquired on the ground often had no influence on government policy. For example, one US army general demanded more troops, while another advised the United States to win over, rather than eliminate, the low- and mid-level employees of Saddam Hussein’s Baathist regime. But Donald Rumsfeld and his advisers ignored this feedback and the military experts were overruled by the politicians. Though Rumsfeld – who was near the top of the hierarchy – may have had a broad strategy in mind, his refusal to consider the dissenting opinions of experts on the ground harmed the American mission in Iraq. Chaos broke out. In contrast to a centralized, distant authority, the generals on the ground were able to make better decisions because they could capitalize on local knowledge. Once it was clear that America was facing failure in Iraq due to an untameable insurgent uprising, the politicians changed their strategy: train the Iraqi army, then return home. What they didn’t take into account, though, was that the complex mix of stakeholders in Iraq – Sunni, Shia, American, etc. – made it difficult to halt ethnically charged violence. However, there were a few individuals on the ground who ignored the official strategy and achieved results in their own way. One was H. R. McMaster, an American colonel who’d arrived in dangerous Tal Afar in 2004 and taught troops to interact with the locals. McMaster’s actions resulted in cooperation between citizens and troops, which helped to accomplish the common goal of driving insurgents out of the city. The world is a complex place. Our modern economy, for example, depends on an intricate network of global supply chains, to the extent that, say, a Brazilian logger doesn’t know whether the trees he fells will be used to make a table or a guitar. Even apparently small issues – economic and otherwise – are far more complex than you might first think. One postgraduate student found this out for himself when he attempted to build a toaster from scratch. As he embarked on the project, he realized that sourcing the necessary materials was no simple task. He had to collect iron ore from an old mine in Wales; employ electrolysis to get copper from polluted water; scavenge plastic from a rubbish tip; and melt down commemorative coins for nickel. In the end, after all that work, not only did the device merely warm bread, but it was also a health hazard. Such complexity entails progress via a series of failures. Only people who adapt succeed. Take the engineer Peter Palchinsky. In the 1920s, Palchinsky was hired to advise on grandiose Soviet projects like the Lenin Dam, which was intended to be the world’s largest hydroelectric structure. From the outset, Palchinsky had several criticisms, all of them related to the lack of potential for adaptation. First, there was not enough variation in the plans to take into account other means of energy production. Second, these experiments were not tested first on a scale small enough to be survivable should things go wrong. And third, the leadership ignored feedback that would have helped them to select solutions from mistakes. Despite Palchinsky’s criticisms, Stalin wanted to build as quickly as possible, so he overlooked the problems. Ultimately, the dam was a failure both as a feat of engineering and economically. Ten thousand farmers were resettled to accommodate it, and its laborers suffered appallingly. This highlights a common mistake that many of us make. We often have a false sense of control or knowledge when in reality the situation is complex. Fortunately, we can help to manage such problems by using a trial-and-error, adaptive method. In the following blinks, we’ll look at the way in which the evolutionary principles of variation, survivability and selection underpin success in the modern world. Often, a solution to a complex problem is achieved by experimenting, and testing out many different design variations. In the 1920s, no one realized the military potential of fighter planes – even the British, who didn’t believe that bombers could be stopped by them. A decade later, however, the British Air Ministry requested designs for a new fighter aircraft. At first, none of the companies competing for the contract impressed them. But one of the firms returned with a new aircraft: the Spitfire. Despite many doubts, including those of Winston Churchill, the plane was eventually commissioned as an “interesting experiment.” Ultimately, the Spitfire was an incredible success: it was capable of diving at nearly twice the speed of existing planes, and was agile enough to fight off the Luftwaffe, stopping the Nazi invasion. So, how do we encourage more innovation like this? There are two effective ways to accomplish that goal. The first is patenting. Patents stimulate innovation by giving inventors a monopoly on the use of their idea, so they have a chance to profit personally. The second approach is even more effective: to award specific, goal-oriented prizes to researchers, which encourage the boffins to compete with one another. These prizes are awarded to people or teams that accomplish a particular goal. Both the prize money and the competitors are often funded by philanthropists who want to expand their possibilities for profit in a new market. In 2004, for example, the Ansari X Prize awarded $10 million to the first team to fly a private airplane into space. There were 12 competitors, one funded by a town’s coffee shop. The winner was the “White Knight,” an airplane that was funded by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. Although it was a strange-looking contraption, it was able to reach the brink of space. As this example suggests, important breakthroughs, such as private spaceflight, are likely to be accomplished in a much shorter time with research prizes than with patents. Picture a slice of Swiss cheese. Imagine that this slice of cheese represents one layer of safety in a system, and that its holes are points of vulnerability. By stacking many of these slices on top of each other, any clear path through the cheese would be blocked, right? Though it might seem logical, this is not a surefire way to eliminate accidents. In fact, certain safety measures actually create new ways for failures to propagate through a complicated system. Take financial instruments such as Credit Default Swaps (CDS). These were created to allow banks to offload the risk of their loans not being repaid. For example, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) would repay JP Morgan for any losses it incurred from its loan to Exxon. This freed the bank to take on more risky business, meaning that networks of previously unconnected companies and institutions became entwined in the same complex deals. The effect of this is “tight coupling,” which can lead to a rapid, domino-like collapse of the system. Therefore, when one company collapses, it pulls others down with it – as happened with Lehman Brothers, whose disintegration ultimately led to the financial crisis in 2007/2008. So, how can we improve our ability to survive such failures? Improved survivability requires simplified systems, loosened interactions and contingency plans. Let’s look at the financial system again. One way to increase its safety would be to establish solid contingency plans in the event of bankruptcies. Regulators could mandate that banks with complex operations have to retain a large amount of capital as a “cushion.” Another method is for large banks to split into two – one part with utility functions like ATM cash and savings accounts, and another exclusively for speculative banking, such as trading derivatives. This, however, overlooks the complexity of finance, as some of the speculative side – for instance, venture capital – is responsible for funding a lot of innovation, like start-ups. As this shows, a complex world will produce many errors that we can’t eliminate, so a balance must be struck between risk and innovation. In searching for the source of any given problem, we must learn to distinguish actual causes from ostensible ones. Let’s take randomized trials as an example. Randomized trials place subjects into groups at random and give each group a different solution or treatment to be tested. These trials are effective because they help us to distinguish between a problem’s apparent cause and its actual one. Many such trials have taken place within foreign development aid. To test the hypothesis that textbooks improve test scores, one Dutch charity in Kenya delivered textbooks to a random selection of schools. Surprisingly, textbooks had very little effect on the students’ scores. Then, the same charity gave the schoolchildren a treatment against intestinal worms. While worms weren’t expected to have an influence on learning and academic performance, this program was actually more successful than the textbook experiment, because it reduced the number of absences due to illness. However, certain problems seem impossible to solve using randomized testing. Yet, even then, there are still ways to draw useful insights about a problem’s causes. These intractable problems are known as fundamentally unidentified questions – or FUQs. Since such problems have a complex mix of causes, it’s very difficult to pinpoint a single cause to test. It may also be impossible to measure such causes until after the fact, like the role of carbon dioxide emissions in climate change. The same is true in measuring corruption. Take learner drivers in India. Researchers approached several learners, promising some of them cash for passing their test, while subsidizing the lessons of others. After their test, the researchers surprised the drivers with a second, independent test. Compared with the learners who’d had their lessons subsidized, those who’d received the cash prize were more likely to have passed their initial test. However, they were less likely to be able to drive sufficiently well in the second test. Why? It turned out that those learners who won the cash prize had bribed the examiners! This type of experiment serves as an identification strategy: a way for us to see what can cause FUQs (such as corruption and bribery). We all want to help the environment. Sometimes, though, the initiatives we create to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels can turn out to be bad for the planet. In 2003, a UK council ruled that any mid- or large-scale development must have the ability to produce, on site, at least ten percent of the energy required by the building. The problem was that the council didn’t stipulate that this renewable energy had to be used! Another problem with the rule was the specification that the energy be created on site: clearly, a wind turbine placed on top of a building in a crowded area is less effective than one positioned on a nearby hill. A similar situation has developed in the United States, where, in 1975, standards were introduced to improve the fuel efficiency of vehicles. However, because there were fewer regulations for light trucks, manufacturers created the “sports utility vehicle” (SUV). This bore enough of a resemblance to a light truck to convince regulators it should be subjected to the same standards of fuel efficiency. The result was that the efficiency of vehicles sold in the United States actually declined between 1988 and 2003. A more fruitful experiment that could help to reduce carbon emissions is a carbon tax, as this would guide commerce toward cheaper, more energy-efficient products. Much of what we consider to be environmentally friendly is actually not. If you live in the United Kingdom, it may seem more ethical to buy locally grown tomatoes than Spanish imports. Yet the locally grown produce actually results in greater carbon dioxide emissions. Why? Growing tomatoes in Britain requires heated greenhouses, whereas in Spain, they grow in direct sunlight. Even accounting for their transportation to the United Kingdom, Spanish tomatoes use less fossil fuel. A better way to reduce carbon emissions is to impose a $50 tax on every ton of carbon emitted by fossil fuels. This would raise the current market price, incentivizing us to drive less or use less electricity, and would encourage us to choose renewable energy sources What do the U2 plane, which photographed the Russian missiles in Cuba, the Blackbird, the fastest plane in the world, and radar-immune stealth planes have in common? They were all developed within the experimental “Skunk Works” division of the defence firm Lockheed. Such safe havens, or cultures of experimentation within companies, encourage greater innovation. In companies that have safe havens, unconventional ideas can gestate without the stifling influence of company politics. A famous example is Google, which allows its engineers to use 20 percent of their contracted time to pursue any project that interests them. The successes come through approval from fellow engineers. And while 80 percent of the projects have failed – Google Wave, for instance, which was voted one of the worst tech products of 2009 – a massive 50 percent of Google’s current products come from this project time, such as Gmail and Adsense. The decentralization of authority implicit in granting employees autonomy encourages a culture of trust and a free exchange of ideas. Companies such as Whole Foods Market and Timpson give workers an unusual amount of autonomy. Whole Foods teams, for example, give potential employees a four-week trial period before staff vote on whether to hire them or not. If at least two thirds vote yes, it doesn’t matter what the manager votes. And in every Timpson store, old cash registers are used in place of electronic point-of-sale machines, so that head office has less control. In fact, staff are even given £500, which they can use in certain situations – like helping customers out if they can’t afford to pay, or gifting cash to shoppers who have been disappointed with a purchase. Timpson has also instituted peer monitoring, where employees are responsible for each other’s problems, regardless of rank. An employee who makes a mistake, whether by accident or not, can be identified and the situation can be quickly rectified – a type of whistleblowing that’s encouraged by the company. In 2002, the ballet and musical Movin’ Out premiered in Chicago. It was critically panned. As the production was due to begin its Broadway run in three months, its choreographer Twyla Tharp was distraught. As we’ll see, the way Tharp dealt with this very public failure was inspiring. Our brains often stand in the way of our success, trapping us in behavior that stops us from growing. How? First, failure usually leads to denial. For example, certain prosecuting attorneys whose convictions were proved wrong by DNA testing concocted wild theories to deny any miscarriage of justice. In much the same way, Tharp could have dismissed the views of her critics. Second, we can throw more resources after our losses, hoping that they disappear. Even some professional poker players let their emotions override their rationality, and make aggressive bets to win back the amount they have lost. Third, we have a tendency to see the past as better than it actually was, interpreting old failures as successes. In a similar way, Tharp could have decided afterward that she’d planned all along to make a piece so avant-garde that the mass-media critics actually validated it with their scorn. However, with the support of friends and family, we can distinguish our mistakes from our self-worth and find the strength to move on from failure. This group of close allies – our validation squad – provide vital constructive criticism. Tharp’s validation squad picked out the most valid criticism of Movin’ Out for her to work on. In response, Tharp got up early, and rehearsed and improvised like there was no tomorrow. She also made changes to the characters, cut lines and kept morale among the actors high. Once it reached Broadway, Movin’ Out became an award-winning success. The key message in this book: We cannot expect to understand the world, plan with confidence or avoid failure. Instead, we must try out many things, prepare for many failures, ensure we can survive them and be able to learn from them. Actionable advice: Exploit parallelism to increase your chances of success. If you want to expand your social circle, join as many different clubs or meet-ups as you can, and not just the ones you think will be most helpful. Often the options we consider to have less potential actually turn out to be unexpectedly fruitful. We just won’t know unless we try lots of things out within a short space of time.

In a word, adaptability – the ability to change with the times and piggyback on technological and social changes to achieve success. Adaptability is a skill that’s becoming indispensable in today’s frenetic world of business. Markets and consumer tastes are fickle, and nothing is as likely to land you in hot water as complacency. That’s something business strategist Max McKeown knows a thing or two about from his work with clients like Microsoft and Sony, who’ve mastered the art of anticipating the future and changing course accordingly. But don’t just take his word for it. In these blinks, we’ll analyze adaptability in action everywhere from a small Italian village battling post-financial crisis austerity measures, to the boardroom of a multinational coffee chain and the post-war British car industry. Along the way, you’ll find out why Ford turned down a US government bailout proposal in 2008; how Netflix almost came unstuck by pushing adaptability too hard; and why it sometimes takes a radical to do the right thing. In 2009, American golf star Tiger Woods’s position in the sport’s global rankings took a nosedive. By 2011 he’d slipped from number one to 58th place. It was an odd sight, especially since Woods had been known for his incredible consistency since bursting onto the scene in 1996. So what went wrong? Well, it was a sign of the golfing god’s mortality. Life is unpredictable, and even the most successful people can’t always dodge the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. It turned out that Woods’s on-field performance problems had roots in his personal life. In 2009, the media ran a story about him crashing his car outside his house. Neighbors told reporters they’d seen his wife chasing after him with a golf club in her hands. Rumors of substance abuse and infidelity began circulating and major sponsors including Gatorade and Gillette dropped their formerly prized sponsee. Woods didn’t let any of that get to him, however. In fact, he demonstrated just how important adaptability is when you’re faced with setbacks. He continued working hard, even as his stats slipped, and learned how to deal with the media pressure he was under. His perseverance paid off. By March 2013, he was back at the top of world golf rankings. That makes Woods a poster boy for what the author calls, “High adaptability, high achievement people,” or HAHAs for short. That’s a pretty fitting acronym: HAHAs are people who can laugh in the face of adversity and, over time, claw their way back to the top. What sets them apart is their ability to focus on solutions rather than problems. They look on the bright side of life even as things seem to be falling apart around them, and they remain determined to achieve their goals. They’re also typically unafraid to ask for help and reach out to people who can support them in their struggle to reassert themselves. But these blinks aren’t just about golf. Now that we’ve seen what adaptability looks like in practice, let’s take a look at how it works in business contexts. At the height of the 2008 financial crisis, the US government offered to bail out car manufacturing giant Ford. Despite being up to its eyeballs in debt and looking like it might go under any day, the company ultimately turned down the proposal. There was a good reason for this refusal. Chairman Bill Ford was convinced that companies that fail to adapt fail, period. Sure, an injection of government cash might have solved Ford’s short-term liquidity issues, but it wouldn’t have gotten to the root of the problem – its longstanding failure to adapt to the new realities of the automobile market. The company’s board of directors and its managers decided on an alternative strategy and hatched a plan they called “The Way Forward.” At the heart of this roadmap was a reappraisal of Ford’s relationship with the environment, an issue it had long sidestepped. If the carmaker wanted to remain relevant to American consumers, it would have to move toward their views on environmental matters. What followed was a pretty radical overhaul. Ford downsized by around 25 percent and implemented a system to produce cars more quickly. Most importantly, it shifted to manufacturing smaller and more fuel-efficient cars. The carmaker dodged a bullet, but the company almost left it too late. A better idea than waiting it out and hoping for the best would’ve been to take a leaf out of Toyota’s book. The Japanese corporation is a master at adapting to changing market conditions, a characteristic that allowed it to increase its share of the global car market from 7.3 percent in 1995 to 15 percent in 2005. So what’s the secret of its success? Well, the company has a solid reputation for quality products, but what really sets it apart is its constant search for improvements that satisfy changing consumer preferences. This allowed the company to stay ahead of the curve and anticipate changes in the market long before competitors like Ford saw them coming. To take just a couple of examples, Toyota was already developing low-emission cars in 1992 and hybrid petrol and electricity-powered vehicles in 1995! In the summer of 2011, the Italian government was facing financial issues. Deciding to cut back on expenditures, it introduced a reform to incorporate villages with fewer than 1,000 inhabitants into larger administrative units headed by a single mayor. But one small village called Filettino resisted these measures. It understood that adaptability sometimes means swimming against the current. As far as the villagers were concerned, reacting to new developments didn’t mean rushing into old reforms or embracing change for change’s sake. In their view, one way of adapting was to defend the status quo, and that’s precisely what the mayor of Filettino decided to do. Defying the government, he declared the village’s independence and issued its own currency. It was called the fiorito, meaning ‘flowering’ in Italian – a reference to the settlement’s belief that it would continue to flourish. The village looked to the past for inspiration, harking back to the age before unification when Italy was ruled by many small city-states, kingdoms and principalities. In the end, its act of resistance preserved Filettino’s independence and sense of community. Headstrong Italian villagers aren’t the only beneficiaries of swimming against the current, however. Bucking trends and following one’s own path has also helped a number of companies thrive. Take Levi Strauss as an example. Manufacturing jeans is traditionally a resource-intensive operation. The finishing process alone requires around ten separate washes and gallons of water. If the jeans have a special pattern or a fade effect, that requirement increases even further. That was accepted as a given until the American firm decided to shake things up. Rather than simply going along with the idea that the only thing that matters in business is generating profits, Levi Strauss began factoring environmental considerations into their calculations. Soon enough the company had figured out a way of finishing jeans without using any water at all. By using stones to soften the fabric and rinsing them with a special type of resin, the company cut its water consumption by an incredible 96 percent! It was a regular day in New York in 1985 when Pedro Bach-y-Rita, a Spanish teacher who’d lived a happy and successful life in the city for many years, suddenly collapsed. He’d suffered a massive stroke and was left paralyzed. The doctors treating Bach-y-Rita claimed there was nothing they could do for him. But they were wrong. What they had underestimated was how adaptable humans are. Both of Bach-y-Rita’s sons were in medical school when their father fell ill. Unhappy with his doctors’ diagnoses, they decided to physically re-educate him from scratch, as though he were a baby. The first task they set themselves was teaching him to crawl using kneepads and the support of a wall. Once he’d mastered that, they began setting more difficult tasks like catching balls, which were designed to train his motor systems. Bach-y-Rita made remarkable progress under their supervision. He was soon sitting and, a little later, walking. Astonishingly, within a year he was back at work teaching Spanish at the City College of New York, where he remained until his retirement. So how did Bach-y-Rita regain control over his basic motor functions despite the serious brain damage he’d suffered during his stroke? It comes down to the plasticity of the human brain. Essentially, the undamaged parts of his brain took control of the damaged areas. Bach-y-Rita’s son Paul returned to medical school after helping his father. He later became one of the first scientists to verify the theory of neural plasticity – the idea that the human brain’s capacities and functions aren’t set in stone but can adapt and change. In one experiment, Paul demonstrated that blindfolded participants were able to catch balls thanks to a head-mounted camera which relayed images to their brains through sensory receptors on their tongues. That’s a shining example of how different neural pathways and neurons in the brain can adapt and tackle new tasks, like interpreting images. When people first fail at a task, they tend to lower their expectations and claim that at least they learned something from their mistakes. The crucial question, though, is what past failures teach us: Do we learn how to fail, or how to improve so we don’t fail again? Adaptability is, in large part, the art of learning from mistakes – ideally, the mistakes of others! Take the British automobile industry. In the 1950s, virtually every carmaker was set on developing ever more powerful – and fuel-guzzling – vehicles. They were so fixated on this goal that they overlooked a massive segment of the market: young, urban and environmentally-minded people. The advantage thus passed to German competitors who were churning out popular, compact microcars like the Messerschmitt KR200. As a result, British brands were being crowded out altogether. Did that make them change their approach? Hardly. There was, however, one notable exception: a small team of auto engineers at the British Motor Company headed by designer Sir Alec Issigonis. Observing their peers’ stubborn refusal to change with the times, the team decided to spearhead the production of a new style of car – the iconic Mini marketed by Morris Mini-Minor. Learning from the mistakes of others and adapting to new consumer preferences quickly led to success. Over the following decades, the British Motor Company went on to sell over five million Minis. That said, you can take learning from mistakes too far, as PepsiCo found out in 2009 when it developed a new brand image for Tropicana orange juice. When the company’s massive marketing campaign backfired and sales plummeted by 20 percent, PepsiCo panicked. Realizing that the branding made the product look anonymous and cheap rather than promoting awareness of its quality, they scrambled back to square one. Instead of making a few minor tweaks and fixing the mistake, they reverted to the old branding. The upshot? They blew $33 million to change absolutely nothing! In 1940, Adolf Hitler ordered the shutdown of all weapons development research programs expected to take longer than six months to reach completion. It was a costly miscalculation for Germany. Why? Because experimentation is the cornerstone of effective adaptation. The mistake would haunt Nazi Germany as the tide gradually turned against it in the Second World War. While German scientists were shackled to short-term targets, their Allied counterparts were given free rein to experiment with new weapon technologies for as long as they pleased. When defense scientist William Butement came up with an idea to develop a proximity fuse, for example, he was encouraged to delve deeper. A proximity fuse is a useful piece of gadgetry if you’re in the middle of a shooting war. A bomb fitted with the fuse’s radar technology will only detonate when it’s sufficiently close to its targets. Older bomb types, on the other hand, used standard timers that often exploded long before – or after – they’d reached their targets. Needless to say, the bombs with the proximity fuses did the most damage. Crafting the perfect proximity fuse took time and dedication, and it was only after years of experimentation with prototypes that the finished article was ready for deployment. It came just in the nick of time. In 1944, a German counteroffensive caught the Allies off guard and the outcome of the Battle of the Bulge hung in the balance. Lucky that they had the perfect weapon to beat back the onslaught: artillery units equipped with lethally accurate proximity fuse shells. Experimentation also has its uses in the metaphorical war between businesses. Take Apple, a company that has long been synonymous with a culture of experimentation. When its new products meet a negative reception, it shelves them and gets to work on a superior alternative. You may or may not remember Apple’s first handheld computer – the clunky, error-prone Newton. The Newton crashed and burned and Apple responded by going back to the drawing board. The result? Its designers used the prototype to develop the iPod, iPhone and iPad. Learning to drive is thrilling. The world suddenly becomes broader as exciting new possibilities come into focus. But you have to be careful. It’s easy to get carried away and put your foot down. That’s when things go wrong and you find yourself at risk. The same thing happens to businesses when they push too hard: the wheels come off and they crash. Take Netflix. The company understood that the future of movie watching was streaming before any of its competitors, and it steamed ahead. What was the problem, then? It was too quick for its subscribers, who were still satisfied with the old offer which allowed them to rent DVDs and stream for $9.99 a month. In 2011, Netflix decided to push its customers and split their offering into two separate components: rentals and streaming, now priced at $7.99 each – a pretty hefty price hike for people who wanted to continue using both services. The decision didn’t go down well. Netflix hemorrhaged a million subscribers and the value of its shares fell by 25 percent. The service did eventually recover, of course, but if it hadn’t been so hasty it would have achieved its current success much sooner. Failing to anticipate changes in the market is even more damaging, however, as Blockbuster found out. Founded in 1985, the movie rental business quickly grew over the following decades. By 2008, it had thousands of stores across the US. But despite its dominant position in the market, it was caught entirely unawares by the streaming revolution. Even worse, it failed to launch its own streaming service while Netflix began establishing itself. That would have been simple enough – after all, Blockbuster held all the aces: it was a household name with a large customer base and plenty of capital. But Blockbuster wasn’t nimble enough to adapt to new realities. It continued focusing on customer experience in its bricks-and-mortar stores even after a new CEO was hired in 2007. By 2010, the writing was on the wall. Blockbuster declared bankruptcy and was gobbled up by the American TV company Dish Network. It’s easy to look good when the economy’s booming and you’re backed by a reputation built up over decades. But success can breed complacency. The result of taking your eye off the ball? You lose sight of your goals. Take Starbucks. Everything had been plain sailing for decades when it hit the rocks in 2007. The coffee chain’s chairman Howard Schultz had an idea about what had gone wrong: its dominant position had incubated an arrogant outlook and the company had stopped taking care of its customers. He was right. Formerly loyal patrons weren’t happy and had started going elsewhere in search of their coffee fix. That same year, Starbucks closed over 900 stores and fired 1,000 of its employees. That was the end of the growth policy championed by the company’s CEO between 2002 and 2007, Jim Donald, who had become obsessed with opening more and more stores. The mad rush to expand had resulted in Starbucks losing touch with its founding values. In the end, Starbucks scraped through this rough patch. So how did it turn things around? Well, it had a leader who was prepared to push through radical reforms: Howard Schultz. One of the first things he did after taking charge was to close 7,000 Starbucks stores in the US and give every barista extra training to help them up their coffee game. When a test revealed that McDonald’s had better-tasting coffee than Starbucks, Schultz introduced new roasting and grinding processes. None of that was rocket science. Schultz simply understood that a coffee chain has to do two things to retain its customers’ loyalty: prepare a great cup of joe and offer a selection of delicious cakes and pastries. But sometimes it takes a radical visionary to do the commonsensical thing. By 2010, his policy had paid off. Starbucks had recovered and its revenue increased to $10.7 billion! That just goes to show how important adaptability is when you’re struggling to get ahead or just treading water. While you shouldn’t rush change, it’s worth keeping an open mind, experimenting and seeing what incremental changes you can make to improve your situation. The key message in these blinks: Adaptability is all about looking ahead, reading the signs and using the prevailing winds to chart your course. Once you’ve mastered that art, you can plan ahead and avoid being caught off guard by sudden changes. That’s especially true in business. The most successful companies consistently demonstrate an ability to change with the times, experiment with new solutions and adapt themselves to customers’ changing desires and needs.  Actionable advice: Believe in the impossible. What stops us adapting? Well, nothing throttles innovation like the belief that some things are simply impossible. Take it from American biologist George Church. He was convinced he could design a machine that could decode the entire human genome. Ignoring the naysayers, Church pressed ahead with his vision and constructed his device. While the procedure initially cost a staggering $3 billion, Church managed to reduce the price to just $5,000 over the years. Today, there’s a real chance that it might become affordable enough to be integrated into routine medical testing, opening up the possibility of all sorts of medical breakthroughs! Got feedback?

When you did get a chance to show your stuff, they’d hang over your shoulder, correcting every little thing you did. Chances are, this sort of “helicopter” bossing made you miserable, and what’s more, you certainly didn’t perform to the best of your abilities. The truth is, being a great boss – a great leader ‒ isn’t about what you do, it’s about how you feel, or the attitude you have. The best leaders are those who know how to inspire employees, encouraging greatness in the every day and finding ways to unlock hidden potential in everyone. The secret is, great leaders aren’t born, they’re made. Are you ready to become a great leader? These blinks will show you how. In these blinks, you’ll also discover why there is a big difference between leading and managing; why great leaders should offer rewards and not incentives; and why nothing beats a positive attitude. Ever had a terrible boss? They’re the ones who make getting out of bed each day difficult, who fill your commute to work with dread. Though such bosses hold senior positions in a company, they certainly aren’t leaders. Even the most talented individuals can’t realize a grand vision without support. Leaders of brands, businesses and organizations need employees, of course – but more importantly, they need people just as determined to succeed as they are. Employees will only feel inspired by work if their leader is inspired, too. Imagine your team works around the clock to produce innovative software to improve your product. It’s been a long, hard slog, and morale is waning. What would a good leader do? A good leader would show a positive attitude, no matter what. By reminding employees of their importance as part of a project and even planning a celebratory get-together once the work is done successfully, you can give your team the extra boost they might need. But if you continue to bemoan obstacles and tear your hair out over how long a project is taking, you’ll undermine your competence as a leader. And soon enough, your team will feel and perform poorly, too. There are no benefits to being a demotivating leader. So why do so many pessimistic bosses have the upper hand in organizations? One Gallup poll revealed that bad bosses were the top reason for a person quitting a job. Even the employees who do stay onboard often feel disengaged when bad leaders are involved. Another poll saw 70 percent of US workers express feelings of disconnection in their roles at work. Unfortunately, inspiring leaders are hard to come by in the modern workplace. Today, the labels “manager” and “leader” are used interchangeably. But management and leadership mean two completely different things in the modern workplace. Management and measurement go hand in hand. The job of a manager is to control a team and ensure that work is progressing as it should. For a manager to know when and how she should make a change, she needs to measure her team’s progress. For instance, a manager might feel her team’s productivity is declining. A poor manager might look at when staff arrives to work, or when and for how long they take lunch breaks. These details could reveal the symptoms of a problem, but won’t uncover its real cause. A good manager knows to measure the salaries of employees against competing companies, and the quality of a company’s computers and facilities against the latest models and trends. With this in mind, a manager can pinpoint the places where making a change would benefit employees the most. But if a manager is there to track a team’s progress, what role does a leader play? Simply put, leaders are responsible for inspiring employees to achieve more. It goes without saying that good managers and great leaders are a fantastic combination. So where can we find them? Often, a boss or a manager was formerly just a great employee. But doing a job well and knowing how to motivate others to do a job well are entirely different things. Managing is a skill in itself and requires the right experience, training and attitude. Similarly, great employees don’t become great leaders simply by receiving a fancy new job title. Being appointed a “chief director” or “head” of something doesn’t mean you naturally have the leadership skills to match. Like management, leadership is a skill – perhaps even an art! Leadership is not something you have but a trait you must demonstrate, over and over again. In other words, a leader has to take action. And a great leader never hesitates to take the best course of action without compromise. Naturally, it’s vital that you make employees feel that their suggestions and ideas matter. But you must also remember that the final decision lies with you, the leader. Take new ideas on board by all means, but stick to your guns when you know your plan is the correct one. Say your company is designing a new hair dryer. Based on research, you know customers will respond to a hair dryer with a sleeker design and a more powerful motor. And yet, a team member insists that including an epilator in the design is the best way forward. What should you do? You could hold meeting after meeting in an attempt to come up with a compromise design. But your best option is to stick to the original plan. As a leader, if you’re confident that your idea will work, don’t let detractors get in your way. The product’s success will speak for itself. But what if your team seems to fight your every move? If things are getting out of hand, the problem might not be with them but with you. Failure to commit to past decisions can make it difficult for employees to take you seriously in the future. Let’s imagine you’ve just been named CEO. You’re thrilled, and the first thing you do is gush about your plans to inspire your team. But time passes and after all your promises, you’ve yet to put anything into action. You begin to notice that your employees lack the motivation to do even the most basic of jobs. Think about it: if you don’t follow through on your decisions, why should they? But if you demonstrate unwavering commitment, you’ll see that your team will support you every step of the way. Let’s take a closer look at what it means to make your team feel that their ideas matter to the company. Great leaders constantly listen. Whether helpful suggestions, strange ideas or grumpy complaints, there’s nothing a leader should ignore. A leader can only make good decisions once she has all the information she needs. Sometimes the best ideas come from the most unlikely places. In fact, your staff might come up with many great ideas. Unfortunately, you aren’t always able to give your team credit for it. This is one of the harsh realities of leadership. Sometimes, leaders must portray employee ideas as their own. Sound exploitative? It is. But if you give your staff the respect, care and yes, compensation, that they deserve, they’ll accept this compromise as just the way work is. Be honest with your employees and they’ll respect you, too. A leader worth respecting is also one who knows how to deliver criticism well. In this case, brutal honesty isn’t always the best policy. Blaming employees for mistakes and pressuring people to perform will only demoralize them. This is the last thing you want. So how can you address problems productively? If you ensure your company places a focus on overall improvement and skills development, as a leader you’ll be better equipped to address a situation when a valued employee does the wrong thing. Rather than criticizing, ensure that the employee and the company at large learn from the mistake. The chances are that being treated with respect will inspire your employee to perform better than ever afterward. Leadership plays an important role in your staff’s lives. And identifying leadership potential is crucial when you’re hiring new employees, too! To find the individuals that will give your business the support it needs, you’ll need to keep your eyes peeled for the right attitude in a potential employee. But first, you’ll need to embody the right attitude yourself as you recruit. By thinking of staff as replaceable and around for only a limited time, you’ll end up with employees who are interested only in a paycheck and nothing else. But if you want individuals that will personally invest in the work they do, then you’re looking for employees you’d never dream of replacing. The questions you ask in interviews are key. Experiment with questions that reveal how an applicant would engage in their tasks. Present them with hypothetical problems that require a bit more thinking, and you’ll gain insight into how they approach work. Soon enough, you’ll know how to spot the staff with an attitude to match yours. The right attitude is also central to how you reward employees. Let’s be clear: incentives and rewards are not the same things. While incentives make a promise to encourage better performance, rewards are only given in recognition of great performance. An incentive bonus for finishing work before a deadline is a bribe to motivate employees who should be motivated by your leadership alone. A reward for completing a task faster is something employees should earn, and something you can even surprise them with. With these points in mind, you’re equipped to take your leadership skills to the next level. It’s now time to show that you’ve got the attitude of a great leader. Your staff will notice and appreciate it, too. The key message in this book: Leadership is too often confused with management. Bad leaders are often pessimistic and don’t know how to effectively inspire employees. Firm decision making, great listening skills, open communication and above all, a positive attitude, are what make a leader exceptional. Actionable advice:  It’s all right to be selfish! Let’s face it: business is no cakewalk! Leading a team means you have to make tough calls, but this is part of the job. If a decision you’re making falls between an action that will help your business and one that will appease certain employees, know that the business should win, every time. If you’ve explained your decision as best you can and still can’t secure everyone’s support, sometimes you have to put yourself first and forge ahead with your plan. Got feedback?

Social networking has made it easier for us to connect with people around the globe, but it’s also linked to depression and social isolation. Email and instant messaging have accelerated our ability to communicate, but at the expense of the richer experience that comes with face-to-face contact. Remote working may offer flexibility but it makes it harder to collaborate with colleagues and form workplace friendships. The world is becoming a little less human, and that has a cost. So it’s time for leaders in the business world to think about how they can recognize the benefits of technology while also accepting its limitations. Leaders need to consider how they can get back to a more human approach to business that acknowledges our universal need for interaction and understanding. These blinks provide solutions to some of the most common problems caused, or exacerbated, by technology in the workplace. In these blinks, you’ll learn why technology is as much a distraction as a productivity aid; how important it is to have good friends at work; and why a heartfelt compliment is a better reward than a cash bonus. Digital technology continues to change the world. Things that barely existed a decade ago, like smartphones and tablets, messaging systems and social networks, are a fact of life today. And this technology undoubtedly has had many positive effects. It has never been easier for us to connect and stay in touch with people all over the world. But technology is also having a negative impact on people’s lives. For one, it exacerbates social isolation – a lack of contact and connectedness with other people – particularly amongst younger people who use technology the most. That’s because people crave human connection but nonetheless find it easier and simpler to turn to a device than to have a normal conversation. As a result, people feel they are getting their dose of social interaction. But in reality, they are missing out on forming real relationships. The University of Pittsburgh conducted a study in 2004, finding that a person spending two hours a day on social media doubled their risk of social isolation. Depression is also a concern. University of Houston research from 2015 found that the more active someone was on Facebook, the more likely they were to be depressed. According to the author, that may be because they compare themselves to the curated, shiny and impossible versions of their friends’ lives put on display. Isolation and depression damage social relationships that are hugely important for satisfaction. The famous Grant Study, described in great detail in three books by American psychiatrist George Vaillant, followed the lives of 268 Harvard undergraduates for 75 years from 1938 onward. The study discovered that the strongest predictor of life satisfaction among participants wasn’t their career achievements or earnings, but rather the strength of their relationships. Strong relationships have also been shown to help specifically with satisfaction and success at work. A Wharton Business School study from 2017 that interviewed over 700 employees and managers found that employee loneliness was correlated with poor performance. It’s perhaps not surprising. After all, doing business is all about relationships and relationship building. If our increasing tendency to hide behind screens and devices instead of investing in our relationships is weakening our ability to achieve work and life satisfaction, what’s the solution? Surely, it’s to get back to being more human. Read on and find out how you can help cultivate true, human fulfillment in the workplace. Money can’t buy you happiness. It may be a cliché, but it contains a lot of truth because there is much more to fulfillment and happiness than how much you earn. At the heart of employee fulfillment are human relationships. In 1943, the psychologist Abraham Maslow established his famous hierarchy of needs, which set out what is most psychologically important to humans. The oft-cited theory states that after we fulfill our most basic needs – for food, water, shelter and security – what is most important to humans is a sense of belonging and love. This theory is relevant for the workplace and backed up by evidence. Consider a Gallup poll conducted in 2006, which found that people who say they have a best friend at work are seven times more likely to say they are engaged in their work. They also self-report as being more productive and more innovative than those without a best friend in the workplace. This makes a lot of sense. As Leor Radbil, a senior associate at Bain Capital told the author, having great relationships with his coworkers not only makes work easier, it makes coming to work more enjoyable. Stronger relationships with and between your team members mean happier, more effective employees who stay with you for longer. And it very likely means you’ll feel good about yourself, not just as a boss, but as a human being for fostering them! So how can you help your employees to build fulfilling relationships? Firstly, try to build a culture in which technology doesn’t get in the way of fulfillment. Lead by example, by letting go of instant messaging and email in favor of face-to-face conversations, with all the richness – of body language, emotion, and clarity – that comes with them. Secondly, invest in getting to know people on a personal level. Do you truly understand your colleagues? Do you know their life goals and their deepest fears? If not, you can’t truly help them to achieve fulfillment. So take the time to talk, but most importantly to listen, to your employees about their likes and dislikes and their need to feel fulfilled at work. Technology has, without a doubt, helped make everything quicker. Where once we drafted, signed and sent letters that would take days to arrive, now we write emails in no time. But has technology really made us more productive? That’s hard to really say. That’s partly because while technology is fast, it can also be hugely distracting. Twenty years ago, the typical office worker was perhaps distracted by the morning post, unexpected office visitors, phone calls from clients and conversations with colleagues. Today, she is distracted by an unrelenting stream of messages and alerts. Multiple studies show that office workers receive, on average, over one hundred emails per day, each of which has to be processed mentally, even if we don’t reply to all of them. That’s problematic because it means we struggle to sustain our focus on any one task. Professor Gloria Mark at the University of California, Irvine has been tracking the impact of notifications on office workers since 2004, literally following employees while armed with a stopwatch, and timing their activities. Back in 2004, she found that the typical worker switched her attention every three minutes. By 2012, this attention switch happened pretty much once a minute. By 2014, the typical worker was switching focus even more quickly, concentrating on a single task for less than a minute at a time. The pace of life that comes with technology means that losing focus is easy, which can interfere with how you accomplish important tasks. So what can we do to fight back against this tyranny of distracting notifications? For one, you could try turning off all of your notifications, at least temporarily. If there’s a client crisis in the office or an emergency at home, someone will call you. But without the constant buzz of messages and emails, you’ll find it easier to focus on key tasks and thoughts, checking in to email and messages only when it’s convenient for you. Secondly, focus on prioritization, not multitasking. It’s much easier to be distracted by incoming emails if you don’t have a clear sense of your priorities for the day. So take a few moments at the beginning of the week and the start of every day to write down your priorities. Having your most important tasks committed to paper should help you to keep focus. Productivity is hugely important for any business, but it’s not everything. Equally important is staying fresh and creative, something that can only come from having diverse outlooks. Let’s find out why. Almost every major business today pays lip service to diversity and its importance in the workplace. But the harsh reality is that too many businesses remain homogenous. In Silicon Valley, Hispanics and African Americans combined comprise just 5 percent of the total workforce, according to a 2014 USA Today article. And despite the recent rise in prominence of the Me Too movement, and the growing debate about women’s rights in the workplace, just 24 percent of all senior business roles worldwide are filled by women. Quite apart from the inherent injustice of this situation, homogeneity leads to a deficit of diverse viewpoints and ideas. If all of your employees are all white, male and from a wealthy background, your ability to consider how to serve your customers, who are likely to be a lot more diverse, will be limited. Take Facebook. The social network’s Head of Performance Management, Vivek Raval, told the author that because their customers aren’t uniform, they simply can’t be uniform when it comes to the ideas they have and how they execute them. So how can you effectively embrace and manage diversity? Firstly, when hiring, try hard to avoid the unconscious bias that often leads us to recruit people who look, sound and think just like us. Instead of dwelling on a candidates’ school, or where they come from, focus on their ideas. Try a brainstorming exercise in interviews, asking candidates to generate ideas for a challenge you are currently grappling with. That will give you an opportunity to see if they bring fresh insights that you and your colleagues may have missed. Secondly, to ensure you cultivate a diversity of ideas from your team, strive to build a safe space in which everyone feels able to put forward their views. A great first step is to conduct an anonymous brainstorm. Next time you need to generate ideas, have everyone write down their thoughts anonymously. Then host a meeting to discuss everyone’s thoughts. This isn’t just a great way to elicit lots of ideas. You’ll notice that some people take credit for their ideas, while others stay quiet. That will help you understand who needs some attention, if they are to feel safer and more comfortable putting their ideas forward in the future. A more supportive environment means more fresh perspectives. And what business couldn’t benefit from that? Walk into any coffee shop in any big city in the world on a weekday and you’ll likely encounter at least a handful of remote workers, hunched over glowing MacBooks and tablets, typing away. It has never been easier to work remotely, and many of us love the flexibility that it offers. But, as we’ve already seen, human connection, communication and collaboration is key to personal and business success. If your people only communicate through technology, they are unlikely to form the personal bonds that create strong workplace friendships. And they are unlikely to experience many watercooler moments where moments of insight are generated by conversations that can only happen when you are together in the same space. Perhaps the best evidence for the benefits of people working together is that the very companies that have made it possible for us to work remotely are themselves encouraging working together. Apple’s ultra-modern, purpose-built headquarters in California was designed, according to the Chief Design Officer, Jonathan Ive, to be a building in which 12,000 employees could walk, talk, connect and collaborate. And physical proximity really is key. In a 1977 study, MIT Professor Thomas J. Allen found that the closer engineers sat to each other, the more likely they were to communicate. If two engineers sat more than 30 meters away from one another they had an almost zero chance of having regular communication. But encouraging collaboration isn’t just about having everyone in the same place. It’s also about creating a culture that values open communication. Here’s a great exercise that can help you do this: Gather your team, and ask everyone to write down one thing that they regard as a success from the last week and one thing that was a struggle. Then go around the room asking each colleague to say a little about what they’ve written down, before offering your congratulations for successes and discussing as a team how each struggle could be better overcome. By doing and repeating this exercise regularly, you’ll build a culture in which your colleagues can discuss both success and failure openly. You’ll make everyone feel more comfortable about collaborating and seeking ideas from one another. If you are like most people, it’s probably not long since you clicked like on something, whether that’s your aunt’s latest Instagram picture or a particularly witty tweet from a friend. Thanks to technology and social networks, giving and receiving recognition and validation is a fact of everyday life. So leaders should pay close attention to how they recognize great work because it will have a significant impact on employee satisfaction and business success. Indeed, a 2011 paper by Maritz, a specialist employee-reward firm, stated that employees who are consistently and meaningfully recognized at work are eleven times more likely to spend their career with a single company. Often businesses take the easy route, relying primarily on pay raises and bonuses to recognize success. But the evidence suggests, this could be counter-productive. A professor from Duke University, Dan Ariely, ran an experiment at an Intel semiconductor factory in 2016, giving different messages to different employees at the start of the week. One group was promised a voucher for free pizza if they hit their targets in a day. Another group was offered a cash bonus, and a third was promised nothing more than a rare compliment from their boss. The results? By the end of the week, the productivity of the group promised a cash bonus declined and the group due to receive the cherished managerial compliment had delivered the best results. It seems we value personal, human recognition much more than a small monetary boost. So how can you improve the way you recognize success and deliver a boost in performance as a result? Try and embrace more personal ways of showing gratitude. Instead of messaging or emailing an employee to thank them, surprise them and colleagues by acknowledging them in front of the whole team. Doing so will not just help that employee feel great, but will show everyone that hard work and achievements are recognized, and encourage everyone to strive for success. To recognize smaller achievements, try writing a note and leaving it on an employee’s desk, instead of writing an impersonal email. Or, instead of a small cash bonus, give a gift voucher for a favorite local restaurant. In an increasingly impersonal world, this personal touch will work wonders. Sometimes, it feels as if our modern work culture regards empathy – the ability and willingness to understand and share other people’s feelings – as a sign of weakness. Too many leaders are self-serving and focused on getting ahead themselves, while boosting business success at the expense of employee well-being. Indeed, according to a 2016 report into empathy in the workplace, published by employee benefits consultancy Businessolver, one third of all employees believe that the only thing their employers care about is profit. Empathy matters because when leaders demonstrate compassion and willingness to not just understand, but to actively help their teammates, through good times and bad, employees will work harder. Research from the Center for Creative Leadership in 2007 has corroborated this, showing that demonstrations of empathy from leaders are positively correlated with job performance. Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla, is a great example of an empathetic leader. When Tesla experienced problems with worker safety, Musk wrote to his employees. He didn’t just say that safety was his top priority. He offered to meet with every person who had had an injury and promised to get onto the production line himself and perform the same tasks his employees performed every day. You can also demonstrate your empathy as a leader by investing in face-to-face discussions with your employees that explore not just what they are doing at work, but what they are feeling. Since Sam Worobec, Director of Training for Chipotle Mexican Grill, switched from asking his employees questions like “How’s your work project going?” to questions like “How do you feel about your workload?” or “I know you have a lot of family commitments right now, are you handling that okay?,” his team members work much more effectively with him and with one another. They are more ready to talk openly about what is happening in their lives, and he can empathize, commiserate, support and congratulate them more effectively than before. And here’s one final tip for how to make conversations really meaningful. When you talk face-to-face, put your phone away. Research from Virginia Tech has shown that simply leaving a phone on the table while talking reduces the feeling of interconnectedness and empathy between people. Even when we aren’t using it, it seems, technology can get in the way of real, human connections. The key message in these blinks: Too many leaders are reliant on technology, hiding behind it instead of having real conversations with people and ignoring the extent to which it prevents meaningful collaboration. In a world dominated by technology, leaders now have to work hard to help build the human connections and relationships that all of us, deep down, crave. Those who succeed in doing so will reap the rewards of more satisfied, loyal, productive and creative employees.  Actionable advice: Ask your team for feedback about their workspace, and act upon it.  Improve your team’s experience at work by allowing them to help define it. Ask your employees for feedback about their workspaces, from the arrangement of desks and the number of potted plants to the snacks available in the kitchen. Simply giving your employees a voice about the environment they spend so much time in will go a long way in helping them feel comfortable and happy at work. Got feedback?

Metzger, Jeremy Robinson and Judy Rosemarin","summary":"Even people with high-level corporate jobs sometimes need guidance and support. And in these moments, who better to call on than an executive coach? An individual isn’t just born being a successful coach; it takes a certain set of skills and a lot of professional experience. In these blinks, you’ll discover the essential steps in a coach’s journey to becoming truly exceptional.  From learning about a client to putting what you’ve learned into a tangible action plan and reaching an end that pleases everyone, you’ll learn what it takes to excel as an executive coach. In these blinks, you’ll also discover how to question in 360 degrees; how one man used developmental goals to stop micromanaging; and how to deal with the demands of hesitant leaders. Remember what it feels like to start a new job? Stepping out on a new career path can be daunting, and many of us look to coworkers to learn from their examples.  But if you’re starting a coaching career, it’s a different game altogether.  Why? Because good coaching means engaging executives in a process of self-discovery, and there’s no formula for this. Instead, it’s all about creating your own unique coaching style. Shaping what’s called your personal model of coaching helps you go beyond being a cookie-cutter coach to becoming exceptional.  But what does it take to create a personal model of coaching? It all starts with self-reflection. What kind of person are you? What do you bring to the table in organizational contexts? Which coaching concepts and techniques would you prefer as a client?  Note your answers down in full sentences, so you can refer to them later. For instance: “I’d like to have a result-oriented process, where I help my client discover solutions to their challenges.” As you begin coaching, document your experiences in terms of your strengths, your weaknesses and your boundaries as you build relationships with clients. Keep track of the techniques you implement – which ones work and which ones don’t.  Reflecting on yourself and your work will help you discover what makes you stand out among other coaches. The unique aspects of your coaching style make up your personal model.  Though it takes a considerable amount of time, effort and experience before your personal model is fully formed, it’s worth the wait.  Once you’ve developed your model, you’ll have a firm foundation from which you can grow and evolve as you gain more experience and become a more confident coach.  So how do you start? The first element in your personal model is engagement management. Why is it so important? Find out more in the next blink. To provide exceptional executive coaching, everyone involved has to be invested. So how is this achieved?  You need to manage engagement throughout the entire coaching process. This means considering questions such as: How will the contracting be conducted? Who will be involved? What are some possible challenges we’ll face along the way? Whether written or oral, a coaching contract should include the following elements: the steps involved in the coaching process, the time frame, the frequency of coaching meetings and confidentiality agreements.  Having a clear contract allows for expectations to be set up front, before coaching begins. This is far better than running into problems and misunderstandings later on.  In general, there are three parties to contracting that share overlapping interests: client, sponsors (typically a client’s manager or HR manager) and the coach. All three parties can and should have a hand in shaping the coaching contract.  Another success factor in managing engagement is alignment. Alignment occurs when everyone in the process – the coach, the client and sponsors – share the same vision for engagement in the coaching process.  As a coach, you are an advocate for greater alignment between your client and sponsors. As an example, Mark, a coach, takes on Cindy, the head of sales, as a client. Mark was called on to coach Cindy as there have been a series of complaints about her behavior.  However, Cindy's sponsors aren’t keen to be as involved in the coaching as Mark would like. Mark reminds them that he needs their engagement.  Yet he’s got to do this without getting frustrated. Instead, Mark should encourage the active participation of sponsors in the process, even if it may be insufficient at times. This keeps the sponsors engaged, which allows everyone to stay on track throughout the coaching progress.  What makes you want to open up to a total stranger? If you’re like most people, your openness and engagement depends on the person you’re with.  Coaches should therefore always remember to prioritize their unique relationship with their client above formulaic strategies. Though each coach has her own particular style, there are several general points to guide a fruitful coaching relationship.  These points are: trust, based on your client’s safety and confidentiality; honesty, created through your sober, constructive observations; caring, which arises through your empathy; and credibility, which stems from your professionalism.  To establish a positive, productive relationship, you need to prepare for each session. Preparation needs to allow for openness and responsiveness, but should also instill a feeling of progress. In other words, you need to be both open and focused.  This is not an easy balance to strike! To work toward this, you should identify session goals for your client and for yourself, too.   For instance, your goal could be staying more focused on key issues and not getting sidetracked. As for your client, a goal could be that the session produces at least one possible theme of development.  Finally, setting an agenda at the beginning of each session is important for a good relationship. At the start, ask your client how she feels, inquire about her actions and thoughts since the last coaching session and then ask her to tell you what she would like to cover. By sharing the responsibility of setting an agenda, you signal that you have confidence in the client’s ability to overcome her own challenges, and establish how you should work together in the future. This helps you present a credible image which reassures and motivates the client, while building your own coaching confidence all the while! You can’t help someone flourish without having real insight into who they are and what they want. So how can coaches ensure they know their clients better than they know themselves?  Good coaches gain insights about clients by collecting data. This helps a coach not only to understand a client but also how the client is perceived and experienced at work.  Using several data-gathering methods can be especially helpful if a client has limited self-insight or is really unsure about which improvements or changes to work on. There are two broad categories of data that should be collected: quantitative and qualitative. Quantitative data comes from standardized instruments that measure a client more specifically. This type of data can be collected through self-assessments completed by the client, for instance.  Another way to collect quantitative data is to use 360-degree questionnaires, which gather feedback from a client’s immediate colleagues such as managers, peers and direct reports. These questionnaires are excellent for gleaning the perceptions of a client on a wide range of skills and leadership dimensions.  Unlike quantitative data, qualitative data comes from personal observations that others have made about the client, as well your own impressions. In executive coaching, the most frequently used qualitative-data gathering method is interviewing a client’s colleagues.  To gain the data you need, you can ask the interviewee to describe the contexts in which he and your client interact, and his observations about what your client does well and where she could improve.  The goal of this informational interview is similar to other assessment methods, in that you are able to gain a broader, deeper understanding of a client.  So it’s crucial that you design questions by carefully considering which information will be most useful to you and your client. After gaining some insight about your client, you should have an idea of where change has to happen, and why.  Your next step is development planning. This is where the need for change is translated into tangible and actionable goals.  These goals change shape as a coaching relationship matures. To begin, goals emerge from felt needs, the initial wishes articulated by sponsors or clients. These then develop as negotiated goals, explored through a client’s history, feedback and self-perception, to ultimately become designed objectives, shaped from assessment results and other analyzed and distilled data.  Ankit, a coach, was hired before a company promoted a manager named Howard, because he was unfortunately prone to micromanaging employees. This was the felt need of the organization.  Ankit and Howard negotiated that Howard should empower his employees to take more responsibility to overcome his micromanaging. This was the negotiated goal.  Finally, designed objectives are the goals that the client will follow through with even after the coach is gone, in this case: build stronger relationships to support greater empowerment. Once the designed objectives are clear to you and your client, it is time to create a written development plan.  Typical sections in a development plan include a brief statement about process, client strengths, and each designed objective followed by action ideas for progress toward the objective.  Development plans are created with the expectation that they will be shared with sponsors, so they need to be clear also to those who have not been part of the process. Strong development plans become an invaluable resource as the coaching process continues. Once we achieve success, most of us prefer to give others advice rather than receive it. Coaches often find themselves facing considerable challenges when tasked with coaching successful clients.  Coaching senior leaders is a challenge that requires both significant skill and flexibility.  Patience and motivational interviewing make change less threatening for senior leaders, who are often resistant to letting go of a current set of behaviors. It takes more time for such clients to accept change, meaning you have to remain patient, as your credibility may be tested more than it is at lower organizational levels.  Remember that your patience in responding to a senior client’s reluctance also conveys positivity and hope.  A good way to deal with hesitation is motivational interviewing. This method relies on broad, open questions to explore with the client both current and changed conditions.  A few questions might include asking your client what change means to her, and what the pros or cons of change would be in her particular situation. Also, you might want to explore what she thinks she would need to give up to make a change. These types of questions can make change seem less threatening.  Also, senior leaders are likely to treat all outside professionals as consultants, so expect to be lumped in this category as well. Senior leaders may demand counsel from you because they may believe that a coach is supposed to help them in all aspects of their job.  While coaching and consulting can be synergistic, the activities are quite different. In general terms, coaches ask in order to explore, while consultants ask in order to tell. In this situation, coaches need to focus on facilitating discovery.  If your client is facing a challenge and asking for counsel, try to point out the development potential in the challenge. This will support the client’s growth without reducing her responsibility for progress. Everything comes to an end, even successful coaching relationships. It’s highly recommended that you and your client openly discuss the end of the process, and what it means for the future.  A considerate closure depends on what you do to anticipate and plan for the end of coaching. While the closure date can change through mutual consent, it is important to avoid letting the final session be a surprise either to the client or to you.  Targeting a final session makes the ending tangible and prompts discussion of both plans and feelings about those plans. You can use final sessions to ask your client to reflect on a number of issues, such as what she primarily learned through the process, what worked and what could have been better, or how she will focus on development in the future. Ending coaching is also an opportunity for you to reflect on your own experience, identify gaps in your abilities and consider future engagements. After a session has ended, clients and sponsors can be surveyed more formally about their satisfaction and the results of the process on the client’s behavior.  Evaluation is usually framed in terms of answering the question, How effective was coaching in achieving the results envisioned? In evaluating the impact of intervention, psychologist Donald Kirkpatrick has identified four variables. These are: reactions, which measure client’s and sponsors’ satisfaction; learning, which measures what the client learned from the process; behavioral changes, which measure the change seen by others; and organizational results, which measure tangible benefits to an organization, such as increased revenue or more customers.  Try to always create an end process that instills positive closure, confidence in the future and a support structure that encourages continuing development. In other words, give your coaching efforts the positive ending that you and your client deserve! The key message in this book: Every person is unique, and so is every coaching process. By considering the vital elements of coaching, from outlining goals, managing engagement and encouraging development, you can develop an individual style of coaching that will have a positive and enduring impact on your clients.  Actionable advice:Be present.  Make sure to be physically present when your client makes a presentation, or find a way to discreetly join in on meetings. This gives you a real opportunity to observe your client while interacting with colleagues, and you’ll gather concrete examples that your client will be able to relate to more easily.

People stopped being hunters and started being farmers. Most decided that a life of relative comfort and predictability was better than one of risk and constant movement. You might think they made a wise move, but in fact this change led to humanity’s becoming lazier and more complacent, something that affects us to this day. How? Well take a look at any business industry, and you’ll find leaders who embody farmer mentality: people too indifferent, scared or set in their ways to change. More often than not, these people fail. There are others, however, who’ve clung to the life of the hunter; they’re quick to act, ready to be brutal and never scared to take risks. These are the people you ought to emulate. These blinks tell you all you need to know about becoming a hunter, allowing you to succeed in today’s constantly changing world. In these blinks, you’ll discover why Red Bull is a success in spite of its taste; how Volvo uses a car’s ugliness to sell it; and how Blockbuster went from the top to bankrupt in no time. Every business leader thinks they have what it takes to succeed. They’re smart enough to know what needs to be done and tenacious enough to overcome any obstacle that stands in their way.  Nonetheless, failure in business is as common as dirt. And that’s because the people at the top – especially those in fast-changing industries – frequently fall into one of the three so-called farmer traps. Farmer trap #1 refers to complacency, which develops when people rest on the laurels earned from past successes.  As an example, look at typewriter manufacturer Smith Corona, a former industry giant who became complacent and failed to adapt to the changing marketplace. In 1990, the company pulled out of a joint venture with computer giant Acer, because they believed their business was too strong to be vulnerable to market change. Three years later, Smith Corona declared bankruptcy; they’d been crushed by the emerging computer sector.  Similarly, farmer trap #2 occurs when you repeat actions that brought success in the past and expect the same outcome in the present.  Blockbuster Video is the perfect example of a business that crumbled because it fell into the Farmer Trap of repetition: in 2009, the franchise boasted 9,000 locations and 60,000 employees. But just a year later, Blockbuster declared bankruptcy: the company had failed to adapt to the streaming market, continuing to direct almost all their resources into franchising and physical media. Finally, farmer trap #3 describes a state of protectiveness. This occurs when companies set up barriers that protect the status quo and inhibit evolution. For instance, film manufacturer Kodak missed some wonderful opportunities because they were overly protective of their elite status in the analog film market. But that was a big mistake: the company’s unwillingness to invest resources into digital innovation led them to declare bankruptcy in 2012. As we’ve learned, it’s easy to fall into one of the farmer traps. But luckily, it’s also possible to avoid them by cultivating the three hunter instincts.  First, don’t be complacent; instead, be insatiable. Because insatiability – constantly scanning the horizon for the next opportunity – is the core of hunter instinct #1.  Capital One Bank is a great example of a company driven by this instinct. After the 2008 financial crisis, the bank poured their resources into innovation and experimentation. As a result, they soon boasted a billion-dollar portfolio of low-risk assets. In other words, by focusing on innovation, the bank successfully adapted to the marketplace; meanwhile, most of its competitors suffered a credit crunch.  Moving on: hunter instinct #2 rejects repetitiveness in favor of curiosity – the drive to seek out new and fresh sources of inspiration. How else will you spot new trends and develop your next business success? After all, innovation happens when people take creative mental leaps, connecting fields in ways others couldn’t have imagined. And to make those kinds of connections, you have to be curious.  Take entrepreneur Ron Finley as a prime example of this principle. For Finley, his Los Angeles neighborhood was a source of inspiration, leading him to success in a variety of fields, from fashion to urban gardening to social outreach.  Finally, hunter instinct #3 reminds us that we need to have a willingness to destroy. Instead of being overprotective and cautious, you have to be ready to abandon your safety net if you want to encounter new ideas and opportunities. In fact, the willingness to destroy is precisely what explains chef Eric Ripert’s decades-long success. He’s been able to sustain the coveted three-star Michelin rating for years and years, despite the fact that he constantly throws out old menus and starts again from scratch, fully embracing the new. So now that we know how to awaken our hunter instincts, it’s time to learn how to put them into practice. And that’s what the next blinks are all about. It’s time to put your hunter instincts into practice: there are six scenarios, or patterns of opportunity, that will allow you to spot new business models and products, giving you a serious competitive edge. Let’s start with two of these patterns: convergence and divergence. The former, convergence, is about taking advantage of market chaos to create opportunity by mixing and integrating the right trends. After all, you can create a winning idea by combining multiple services and products. For instance, the successful iPhone fitness and running app, “Zombies, Run!,” employs convergence by combining three things: GPS technology, the lucrative fitness market and the highly popular zombie trend. As you can see, combining several appealing patterns and industries is a great way of providing value to customers.  The second pattern, divergence, takes a different approach by carving out a competitive advantage through a unique perspective that diverges from the overcrowded mainstream. Designing a product that taps into compelling alternative notions like rebellion, status or luxury will allow you to stand out from the crowd.  The key to successfully pulling off the divergence approach is marketing; in order to stand out from the competition, you have to turn your greatest weakness into your greatest strength. And that’s exactly what Red Bull did, becoming one of the most successful beverage brands, despite their less-than-palatable product. The company succeeded by using a savvy advertising strategy that communicated an exciting and unique brand. Ultimately, the company proved that with the right marketing plan, you can harness the power of divergence and create successful products and services that stand out. Let’s move on to the next two patterns of opportunity: Cyclicality and Redirection. These two approaches are all about harnessing the power of momentum, by doing things like, for instance, forecasting trends and figuring out how to take advantage of predictably recurring elements such as retro appeal, nostalgia, economic cycles and generational patterns.  This point speaks directly to cyclicality, which requires you to foster a sense of history that’ll allow you to look beyond the moment and anticipate what’s next. This can be a powerful way of carving out opportunity: consider the fact that all sorts of companies – liquor companies and auto manufacturers, fashion brands and food products – have managed to reinvigorate their businesses by tapping into cyclical patterns and taking advantage of nostalgia.  Just look at the success of Instagram, a product that combines nostalgia with the social media photo-sharing trend. These two simple elements are at the heart of the world-famous app, which imbues user-generated photographs with a vintage-like quality.  The next pattern, redirection, aims to channel the power of a trend or behavior by refocusing, reprioritizing or reversing it. This is essentially the art of “spin” – turning a potentially negative narrative upside down, using the momentum of a trend to your own advantage and inspiring desire for your product in the process.  Through well-crafted redirection, you can create an appealing positive narrative out of something more negative. Just look at Volvo: by using the slogan, “They’re boxy but they’re good,” the auto company launched a successful marketing campaign that drew attention to the car’s safety features. By playing up the security aspect, Volvo neutralized the car’s unpopular design and ultimately increased sales. Let’s learn about the two remaining patterns of opportunity: reduction and acceleration. These are both proven methods for finding a specific market, creating a winning business idea and becoming a better innovator, decision-maker and investor.  Reduction involves targeting niche audiences with a product or service that stands out because of its extreme simplicity. Doing this gets to the core of a business concept by using crowdsourcing and localization to remove any unneeded parts.  In other words, by identifying and then skillfully removing all the complex layers of existing products, you can create value and carve out success in a small market. And that will open up many more possibilities.  As it happens, reduction explains the wild popularity of GoPro, an easy-to-use, wide-angle, two-button camera that has proven irresistible to a specific group of consumers eager to capture their adventurous exploits.   The next pattern of opportunity, acceleration, relies on the practice of perfecting, exaggerating, reimagining or repositioning key product features as a way of differentiating yourself from the competition. To do that, you have to identify a crucial feature of an existing product or business concept which you then dramatically enhance. In other words, figure out what’s great about an idea and then accelerate it; making it bigger, faster or better will engage customers.  To that end, just look at Dyson: the brand established itself as the world standard for high-end vacuum cleaners after they refined the device to create the most powerful vacuum on the market. It took 5,127 prototypes to get there, but it was worth it: in 1991, James Dyson won the International Design Fair prize for his ultra-powerful and efficient product. Wake up your “inner hunter.” Familiarize yourself with the six patterns of opportunity. Done all that? Great! Now you can start narrowing your focus and zero in on a great business idea. Of course, finding the nugget of a successful idea is easier said than done. The key is to establish a “hunting ground” and identify a cluster of opportunity – some group of products, services or concepts that have a similar approach. Then, you use the six patterns of opportunity to reframe the central idea and make it special. But don’t limit your hunting ground by only researching and collecting ideas that are obviously similar. Instead, look beyond your immediate market to find clever approaches to similar goals. That’s the way to create something truly unique.  For instance, instead of developing a simple pop-up store concept, use convergence to launch a “Double Business.” One artist, Karl Lagerfeld, did just that when he combined a pop-up fashion shop with an art gallery.  However, no matter what industry you choose to work within, you have to be able to forecast future trends before they actually happen. Luckily, whether you’re hunting ground involves movies, fashion, tech, retail, broadcast media or food, you can use the six patterns to find future opportunities.  In the fashion field, for example, retailers like Zara and H&M have reached success by providing consumers with more choice. In fact, Zara became one of the fastest-growing retailers by both speeding up their production process – they only need 14 days to get a newly-designed product into stores – and by offering thousands of different items at any given moment.  But what’s next? By applying convergence to the fashion industry, we can predict the rise of trends like wearable technology, 3D printed clothing and more. And the firms that figure out how to capitalize on those trends now will be dominant in the future. The key message: Today’s marketplace is far more unpredictable and chaotic than ever before. To be successful in this turbulent environment, you must embrace change. Do so by awakening your inner hunter and exploiting patterns of opportunity. That way, you’ll be able to adapt quickly – to not only survive, but to thrive. Actionable advice: Cyclicality is one of the most persistent and prevalent patterns of opportunity. Whatever your field, you can take advantage of this pattern by following four simple takeaways.

If there aren’t any numbers, if something can’t be measured, then how can one know what action to take? Well, some things are beyond measure. Take relationships, for example. Could you quantify the relationship you have with your family or loved ones, with your friends? Probably not, and, as you probably know, businesses are full of relationships that can produce magnificent outcomes if they work well. So, let’s take a look at how these interpersonal relationships work and what companies can do to achieve greatness through small changes. In these blinks, you’ll find out what social capital is and how it helps businesses succeed; why working more hours leads to less productivity; and about the amazing results of bringing in an outsider. You’ve probably been there before. You’re sitting in a business meeting, and someone proposes a business decision you disagree with. And because you don’t want to seem hostile, you hold your tongue. But avoiding debate is never helpful, and there are ways your company can change this unproductive habit. The key is creative conflict, a skill that, like all others, can be learned through practice. With creative conflict comes a willingness to disagree and challenge the general consensus so that new and creative ideas can be developed. But what many people don’t know is that there’s a talent to productive disagreement. Brooke Deterline is a constructive conflict specialist, and she is always astounded by how her clients assume they’ll be able to productively manage group discussions on their first attempt. It’s particularly surprising since people recognize that other skills, such as learning a language, a musical instrument or public speaking, take time and practice. And when it comes to creative conflict and the ability to effectively express your opinion and meet conflict head-on, it is still practice that makes perfect. The first key point people need to realize is that they must prepare and gain supportive allies before they take on authority figures at the workplace. Deterline coached one of her clients, Luke, through this process when he had to stand up to his aggressive boss while negotiating a contract. The first step was simulating how the situation might play out; they considered how his boss would react to different statements and devised appropriate counter-reactions for Luke. Then, Luke reached out to his colleagues within the company for advice and support. This allowed him to strengthen his position further so that he could engage with his boss in a productive conversation. So, by the time Luke had the actual negotiation with his boss, he was confident. He knew what he needed to say and how to react appropriately to whatever his temperamental boss threw his way. Have you ever been part of a group project where everyone involved was unfamiliar with one another? If you have, then you probably noticed that discussions were mostly unproductive, because everyone was hesitant and nervous around each other. To combat this kind of situation, and enable constructive conflict, it’s important to establish social capital within your company. The concept of social capital isn’t new. Anthropologists who studied early communities coined the term to explain why certain tribes thrived and succeeded – it’s what people in a community feel when they can rely and depend upon one another for help, and it remains a great survival tool for companies today. And you will find that when you combine creative conflict with social capital, your company will enter into a cycle of prosperity. This happens when people engage in creative conflict. The experience allows coworkers to bond with one another and improves their relationships. Naturally, this creates even more social capital within the company, which in turn builds more trust so that people feel more confident to engage in future creative conflict. But creative conflict isn’t the only way to build social capital. One company used a different kind of creativity to help improve collaborative efforts between departments. The CEO launched a company-wide project in which each department was charged with making a short film that highlighted the work of a different department. They weren’t expected to make an Oscar-winning movie, nor did they have to: people only need to take small actions in order to build social capital. And the project worked perfectly. The whole company gathered in a movie theater to watch the results, and the movies not only turned out to be creative and original but also got the previously uncooperative company members talking and bonding with one another. Working longer hours should mean that more work gets done, right? Actually, that might not be the case. Over 100 years ago, scientist Ernst Abbe discovered that reducing the workday from 9 to 8 hours increased overall productivity. Even now, studies continue to show that overworked employees are less productive, but companies remain reluctant to change their ways. Since Abbe’s discovery, many studies have shown that people working over 40 hours a week are less productive and more prone to making mistakes, all of which results in a less efficient company. Yet these companies remain largely blind to these facts. Apart from industries like aviation or truck driving, where long hours can lead to deadly accidents, many continue to believe that workaholics make the best employees. This holds true even in the face of compelling evidence. For example, while 50 percent of all mergers or acquisition deals fail, few people question whether or not this could be due to exhausted CEOs making poor decisions that could be avoided by working more reasonable hours. Working too much can lead to what’s known as tunnel vision. When people are tired, their ability to think and reason diminishes, and they often become stubborn in their decision-making, refusing to adapt to changing circumstances or even recognize existing errors. Naturally, under these conditions, employees become increasingly inefficient in their work, which unfortunately results in having to work even longer hours! What’s worse is that being overworked can lead to health problems as well. In 2012, the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health showed that working 11 hours a day doubles a person’s risk of depression. Furthermore, employees who work more than 55 hours a week start to show signs of losing their language and problem-solving skills by middle age. All this in addition to the slower reaction times that overworked people tend to have. You might think that the analytical mind of a scientist and the abstract mind of an artist would make for an unproductive pairing. But such a team can actually make some astounding breakthroughs. This is exactly what happened at Roche Pharmaceuticals. Team leader Matthias Essenpreis was at a loss when his group was trying to improve the company’s diabetes products. He knew his team needed an exciting new perspective, so Essenpreis came up with an unorthodox idea: to invite an artist to work with the team. It was an effective strategy. While his team of scientists approached problem-solving in a logical way, the artist, Kelly Heaton, took a more holistic approach. Rather than focusing on the technical aspects, the artist took on the perspective of the diabetes patient. She was also a great communicator and her fresh perspective allowed her to ask the right questions when the team was stuck. As a result, in 2003, Roche developed diabetes packs containing an innovative new device that allowed patients to simultaneously administer insulin and measure their blood sugar. Thinking outside the box can also lead organizations to breaking boundaries and connecting with other businesses. Traditionally, companies tend to look inward; they create protective policies and focus on safe products to maintain a comfortable status quo. These days, however, they are discovering that true innovation comes when companies consider themselves as interactive parts of a bigger corporate picture. We can see this change of perspective in ARM, a company that specializes in semiconductor and software design. When ARM started, it was a tiny company of only 12 employees. In order to grow and increase production, ARM learned to collaborate with much larger firms that had thousands of employees. Rather than struggling on their own, they grew by becoming a part of other companies’ teams. Even today, many of ARM’s employees spend most of their time working within other organizations. Companies that don’t collaborate are often less creative than companies that do. Indeed, collaboration is, in some ways, the name of the game. And that’s why companies hoping to innovate should adopt a flat hierarchy. A flat hierarchy is a company structure that eliminates the levels of middle management that separate employees from executives. Paul Harris, CEO of South Africa’s FirstRand Bank is a proponent of flat hierarchies. For Harris, part of this structure’s appeal is a matter of efficiency. Vertical hierarchies, with their long chain of managers, are needlessly complicated: the flow of information from top to bottom can often get stuck in middle management, leaving people lower on the ladder clueless as to what their bosses want them to do. But more importantly, flat hierarchies give every member of a company the opportunity to contribute creative ideas, which makes for a much more innovative environment. When FirstRand Bank introduced a flat hierarchy system, the idea of introducing an electronic payment method and giving clients the ability to use their cell phones to transfer money, easily made its way from idea to implementation and is now a service for every FirstRand Bank customer. The thing is that, when one person has too much power, it’s often a recipe for disaster. Research in this area shows that when people become powerful they also become worse at listening to others, failing to take into account the opinions of their employees. They get so preoccupied with pursuing their own agenda that the ideas, emotions and perspectives of other people simply fall by the wayside. Many of the traits can be traced back to the fact that these powerful leaders tend to feel that all the responsibility rests on their shoulders. Therefore, they are reluctant to seek help or assistance, fearing it will be perceived as weakness. Implementing a flat hierarchy is one way to avoid ending up with a bad leader. The key message in this book: Having a successful company isn’t just about generating billions of dollars in profit; it’s about fostering creativity, innovation and open communication. And you can achieve this with some small but important changes – like cutting down on work hours, flattening hierarchies and encouraging people to voice their opinions. Simple changes like these can make all the difference.  Actionable advice: Lead from where you are. It doesn’t matter whether you are the CEO of a company or a regular employee. Look out for opportunities to lead your team to success. For example, practice voicing your opinion as often as possible. This may result in some annoyance at first, and you may make mistakes, but your team will thank you in the long run for getting the ball rolling and showing that you care about the company.

They are companies with long track-records for success and widely admired as the crown jewels of their industries. What’s more, their success is enduring – they prosper even as great leaders retire and individual hit-products become obsolete. To properly study and learn from these companies, the authors first had to identify them by surveying hundreds of prominent CEOs for the names of companies they considered visionary. The 18 most commonly mentioned firms – including such venerable names as the Walt Disney Company, Marriott Hotels, and Merck – were included in the study. The visionary companies were then paired up with comparison companies: firms that shared similar products and markets but which, while not being outright poor performers, were called “visionary” far less often in the CEO survey. Both groups of companies were then examined across their considerable life spans (the average founding date lay in the 1890s for both groups). Based on massive amounts of data from interviews, annual reports, financial statements, news articles and many other sources, all aspects of these corporations were studied, ranging from their ownership structures to their cultures. To understand the extraordinary success of the visionary companies, consider this fact: if you had invested a dollar in their shares in 1926, that dollar would have been worth $6,356 by 1990. Compare that to $955 if you had invested in the comparison companies, and only $415 if you had invested in the general market, and you’ll see just how impressive the visionary companies’ performance is. No wonder that all manner of Fortune 500 companies have been fascinated by the findings of this study. Visionary companies can teach us through their enduring success. Contrary to what most people believe, the success of a visionary company is not dependent on great ideas. The founder of Sony, for example, had no specific idea of what products his company would make. He actually held a brainstorming session after founding the company to evaluate business ideas ranging from sweetened bean-paste to miniature-golf equipment. Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard also had no specific idea in mind when they founded Hewlett-Packard (HP). They experimented with almost farcically diverse ideas, such as automatic urinal flushers and bowling foul-line indicators. Hence, it seems that great ideas are not necessary for the start of a visionary company. Nor are high-profile, charismatic leaders. While visionary companies did have superb individuals at the top of their organization, they were often down-to-earth, reserved and modest people. But then, what is the secret of enduring success? Many comparison companies had great ideas and strong leadership, yet they all fell behind the visionary companies eventually. Why? Instead of focusing on a single product or a single leader, the visionary companies studied built themselves into outstanding organizations that constantly churned out great ideas and great leaders. The real creation of the founders was not a product at all but the company itself; constantly advancing independently of any one person or idea. Think of a clock on the wall. Having one great idea or visionary leader is like getting a glimpse of that clock and being able to tell the time in that instant. But building an organization that constantly generates great ideas and leaders is like building your own clock: a reliable machine. Visionary companies are like machines that constantly produce great products and leaders. Visionary companies have a higher purpose for their existence than to merely chase profits. Together with the companies’ core values – enduring tenets that guide their every decision – this purpose forms their core ideologies: a set of stable principles that guides the company through generations, much like the “truths” of the American Declaration of Independence. Consider for example the pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson (J&J). In 1935, the CEO, Robert W. Johnson Jr., wrote out the company’s core ideology in a document called “Our Credo,” which listed the company’s responsibilities: first to their customers, second to their employees and so forth. Finally, fifth and last on the list, after all the other responsibilities had been fulfilled, Johnson said that shareholders should receive “a fair return.” Likewise, most visionary companies studied were not primarily after profit. Nevertheless, while some ideologies may seem soft or idealistic, visionary companies managed to find a way to stay pragmatic in their business decisions and make profits without ever wavering from their core ideologies. A core ideology is important not only when visionary companies prosper but also when they hit upon trouble. For example, when Ford faced a dire crisis in the 1980s, instead of just fighting fires, its management team stopped to discuss and clarify what the company stood for and how they could espouse the values of the founder, Henry Ford. Ford’s comparison company, General Motors, made no such effort. Though every visionary company studied had a core ideology, their content varied greatly. What counts is not the content of the ideology but rather that an authentic ideology exists and is rigorously acted upon.  Visionary companies are driven more by a core ideology than profits, but they still prosper. The real heart of what makes visionary companies so successful is that while they jealously guard the permanence of their core ideologies, the manifestations of that core ideology are always open for change and progress. For example, Wal-Mart’s drive to “exceed customer expectations” is a stable element of its core ideology, but the customer-greeters at the entrance to their stores are a practice that can change. Similarly, Boeing’s core ideology is to be a pioneer in the field of aviation, but building jumbo jets is a manifestation of that ideology that can change. This flexibility demonstrates how visionary companies refuse to abide by the so-called tyranny of the OR, whereby a company must choose between staying true to its core ideology or stimulating progress. Instead, visionary companies use the genius of the AND – experimenting and developing – while still adhering to their core ideologies. Visionary companies have their core ideologies to guide them, but they are also relentless in their efforts to continually improve their products, business and organization. They never settle and never become complacent. Consider the founder of the Marriott Corporation, J. Willard Marriot, who lived by the motto “Keep on being constructive, doing constructive things, until it’s time to die… make every day count, to the very end.” This sounds rather depressing, but is also a great commitment to constant progress. Just like their core ideologies, this drive for progress is innate and unquestioned in visionary companies. Progress is stimulated both by setting bold goals and by creating concrete mechanisms that encourage people to innovate and improve. Visionary companies preserve their core ideology while relentlessly stimulating progress and improvement. To drive progress, visionary companies often set themselves extremely bold objectives – so-called big hairy audacious goals (BHAGs) – to which they commit utterly and completely. BHAGs are so ambitious that they often seem unrealistic, especially to outsiders. Nevertheless, they’re also clear and tangible enough to energize and focus the organization. A well-known example of a non-corporate BHAG is the one set by John F. Kennedy in 1961 when he proclaimed that the U.S. would take a man to the moon and back safely by the end of the decade. At the time, this was an almost ludicrously bold commitment, but it did get the U.S. moving vigorously forward. Boeing set many BHAGs during its history, including its commitment to developing the 747 jet. Boeing pursued this goal single-mindedly, without ever even considering the possibility of failure. The CEO stated that they would complete the jet even if it consumed the entire company, which it nearly did: at one stage roughly 86,000 people – some 60% of their workforce – were laid off as sales of the plane did not meet expectations. Similarly, Thomas J. Watson Sr., the founder of the Computer Tabulating Recording Company, set a BHAG by renaming his company – which sold coffee grinders and butcher scales – to reflect his ambition for global status. The new name was audacious at the time: International Business Machines (IBM). BHAGs often take on lives of their own. Just as the space program continued after Kennedy’s death, the visionary companies studied pursued their BHAGs even as new CEOs and directors came and went. Once a BHAG was achieved, new ones were set – always in line with the company’s core ideology. Visionary companies use big hairy audacious goals to stimulate progress. Visionary organizations pursue their core ideologies so single-mindedly that their corporate cultures are almost cult-like. For example, new employees quickly find themselves socializing primarily with their colleagues, and they are encouraged to be secretive about the inner workings of their companies. Employees often become completely immersed in the core ideology. Consider IBM, for example, where future managers in training would rise and sing songs from an IBM songbook: “March on with I.B.M., Work hand in hand…” Similarly, the Walt Disney Company expected its employees to live and breathe its core ideology of wholesome family fun. For example, men with facial hair were not accepted as employees at theme parks, and anyone heard uttering a four-letter word in the presence of Walt Disney himself was fired immediately – no exceptions. There is not much room in visionary companies for people who do not meet their tough expectations and standards. New employees often find that either they fit right in and thrive, or they perform poorly, are unhappy and exit the company quickly. In this regard, there are no compromises at visionary companies. Conversely, because the employees are confident and can be counted on to adhere to the company’s core ideology, they can also be given the leeway to experiment. This stimulates progress and enables the company to avoid the dangerous group-think endemic in many cults. Note though that visionary companies are not personality cults, centered around a charismatic CEO or founder but rather around the core ideology of the company. Though charismatic personalities can also drive passionate work, such “cults” invariably collapse when the person leaves. Visionary organizations are almost cult-like – new recruits either thrive or leave. While the visionary companies studied often had outstanding CEOs at their helm at one time or another, what was even more impressive was their ability to continually produce such high-quality leaders. The organizations focused hard on cultivating managerial talent within the company so that new leaders could be counted on to continue in line with the company’s core ideology. At the same time, visionary companies engaged in timely succession-planning to ensure continuity in leadership even if something unexpected were to happen. Consider for example the General Electric Company (GE), whose most famous CEO is without a doubt, the legendary Jack Welch. But actually thanks to the company’s fervent emphasis on internal management training and CEO succession, GE has enjoyed a century of Welch-caliber CEOs. In fact, more GE alumni have gone on to become executives of American corporations than the alumni of any other company. And Welch himself outlined his plan for succession seven years before retiring, though even this seems last-minute compared to Bob Galvin, the former CEO of Motorola, who began planning for the next generation a quarter-century before finally leaving. In contrast, the comparison companies often hired external CEOs who were unfamiliar with the company and who sometimes began steering it in new, wholly ill-conceived directions. Also, the CEOs at comparison companies were often near-tyrannical and engaged in very little succession planning, which left gaping holes in the companies’ leadership when they left. Some comparison companies even had CEOs who actively hindered succession planning and sabotaged would-be candidates. These companies then stumbled when the troublesome CEO finally left. Visionary companies produce a continual stream of high-caliber leaders. Charles Darwin discovered that evolution is a series of successful “experiments” in which slight variations are introduced to a species and the strongest new variants survive. Similarly, the visionary companies studied understood the need to stimulate a similar evolutionary progress within their businesses. They encouraged their employees and management to experiment with new ideas, products and practices, some of which became great successes. Consider for example J&J’s famous Band-Aids. They were born when an employee put together some surgical tape and gauze to quickly bandage his wife’s fingers after she accidentally cut herself with a kitchen knife. When he mentioned the idea to the J&J marketing department, they embraced it and eventually, Band-Aid products became the company’s best-selling category. Or consider 3M, which directed its employees to use 15 percent of their working time to work on any pet projects they felt like. Two such projects by two separate employees eventually collided to produce the famous Post-It Notes. This would never have happened if 3M hadn’t actively encouraged experimentation and allowed its employees to continue with their pet projects, even when early market studies were negative. Contrast this with 3M’s comparison company, Norton, which actually discouraged the pursuit of opportunities outside of its traditional product lines. One aspect of evolution is that some – or even most – variations fail; the same is true in business. J&J experienced some very prominent failures too, for example, its colored casts for children with bone fractures. The casts quickly turned hospital bed sheets into something resembling modern art and threw hospital laundries into chaos. Visionary companies understood that failed experiments are the necessary price to pay for evolution and must not be punished lest further experimentation be discouraged. Visionary companies stimulate evolutionary progress by encouraging experimentation. While many companies claim to adhere to idealistic values, encourage experimentation or embrace constant progress, very little is seen in practice. The visionary companies studied, on the other hand, managed to translate their values into reality by creating concrete mechanisms that affected the daily lives and decisions of employees. 3M did not merely say, “We want our employees to be more innovative.” Instead, it implemented several mechanisms to encourage this idea, one example was allowing employees to use 15 percent of their time on pet projects and dictating that 30 percent of each division’s annual sales must come from products less than four years old. Likewise, visionary companies did not merely talk about constant improvement; rather, they created mechanisms to ensure it. Wal-Mart, for example, spurred constant growth with so-called “Beat Yesterday” ledgers, which were used to compare each day’s sales to those of the year prior. Similarly, Hewlett-Packard instituted a grueling process of ranking its employees annually to stop those who gained a high status from just coasting. The visionary companies also took concrete actions in the long run. They invested far more than comparison companies in creating new technologies and business practices, training and developing their human capital, as well as in supporting research and development. For example, when Merck wanted to become a force in medical research, it deliberately modeled its labs on academic ones and allowed its researchers to publish their findings in academic journals – very unusual for private companies at the time. It also decided the product-development process should be driven by research rather than marketing as it was in many other companies. This attracted top scientists to Merck’s labs. Visionary companies don’t just talk – they take concrete actions to implement their values. The key message in this book: Visionary companies are able to attain their phenomenal success by staying true to their core ideologies while still relentlessly pursuing progress. A company’s core ideology comprises its core values but also its purpose, meaning the reason it exists beyond profits or shareholder value. To supplement their core ideology, visionary companies also stimulate constant progress by setting bold goals and by instituting grassroots mechanisms to realize their policies.  The questions this book answered: Why should we study visionary companies? Visionary companies can teach us through their enduring success. What are the main principles that visionary companies use to thrive? Visionary companies are like machines that constantly produce great products and leaders. Visionary companies are driven more by a core ideology than profits, but they still prosper. Visionary companies preserve their core ideology while relentlessly stimulating progress and improvement. What are the specific policies and mechanisms that visionary companies use to preserve their core ideology and yet stimulate progress? Visionary companies use big hairy audacious goals to stimulate progress. Visionary organizations are almost cult-like – new recruits either thrive or leave.

So what can you do to structure your business to prepare it for a successful acquisition that gets you the best possible price? These blinks answer these questions through the story of Alex Stapleton, who wants to sell his marketing agency. Alex built up a small company with only a few employees, but wants to have more time with his family and is quite stressed by his work. Ted Gordon, an old friend and entrepreneur who has sold businesses successfully in the past, guides him through the process. In addition, you’ll learn why you should always have more than one salesperson; what it takes to get your management team to stay with your company for a long time; and how to find a broker that’ll get you the best possible deal on your company. Let’s say you’re an entrepreneur who’s just launched a service business, like a design agency. How can you make it successful? Should you concentrate on one service or take any business you can get – even offers requiring services that aren’t your speciality? Some people would accept every offer. But that’s not the right strategy for long-term success. Here’s why: A focus on one service allows clients to see the company’s core strengths. As a result, people will come to you with specific problems that you can solve better than anyone else. When clients can’t go to other firms to receive the same quality of service, you’re positioned to negotiate higher prices. Furthermore, when the results are good, clients will recommend you. Word of mouth will earn you new business. Here’s an example: Alex’s business used to fulfill a broad range of requests – designing brochures, copywriting and search engine optimization. Taking a friend’s advice, Alex decided to concentrate on designing logos. He excelled at the work and his clients loved the product. As a result, Alex became a top logo designer. There’s another benefit to specializing: It allows you to hire the best people for the job. Why? Firms that provide multiple services have to hire experts for different fields. Smaller firms can’t afford to hire as many experts. Instead, they hire generalists to execute different tasks. However, since the employees don’t concentrate on a single field, they can’t deliver the best possible product. The quality never matches what’s produced by other firms, which can employ experts. Luckily, there’s a solution for smaller companies: by specializing, they can hire a few experts in a single area. Specializing helps your company produce excellent work, which puts you in a better position to negotiate with clients. And, perhaps more importantly, your company will run smoothly without too much oversight from you, because everyone will be responsible for discrete tasks. When you start a business, it’s natural to feel ownership. And when a company’s young, the founder is often involved in almost every aspect of the operation. But in order for the business to grow, customers shouldn’t associate the company entirely with its founder. What happens when you as a founder “become the business” in this way? When starting a company, you bear all the risks, so it’s understandable that you’ll want to handle many aspects of the operation on your own. Maybe you think that’s the best way to ensure that your employees don’t make mistakes. So you meet with every client and oversee all financial negotiations. As a result, your clients get used to talking about everything with you in person. For them, you represent the whole company. But this approach will lead to problems. When the company’s roster of clients grows, you won’t be able to lead the business effectively. If you spend all your time with clients, you won’t be able to focus on developing strategies for further growth. You probably won’t have time to manage employees or concentrate on things like financing. For example, Alex, our logo designer, struggled with a tight schedule because he met with every client in person. As a result, he didn’t have time to sit down with employees and discuss each customer’s specific needs. And since employees don’t tailor their work for each client, Alex’s company lost a lot of time when work had to be edited again and again. Plus, since Alex had to attend each meeting, it was difficult for him to go on vacation or take time off from work. As you can see, although it’s important for a founder to have an overview of business activities, the day-to-day operations should operate smoothly on their own. In a sense, the company’s founder should be replaceable. It all comes down to the bottom line, as the saying goes. Thus, a solid sales team is crucial to your business. Because having employees dedicated to sales not only generates money, it also frees the founder to actually lead the business. It’s vital to build a sales team comprising people who understand your service because they represent the firm to outsiders. How do you do that? Hire more than one salesperson. There are two reasons for this: First, healthy internal competition motivates employees to do their best work. By competing with each other for commissions, they’ll generate more business. Second, by having multiple salespeople, you’re minimizing risk in the event that someone gets sick or leaves town. Even smaller companies should have at least two good salespeople who understand how to sell their specific service. Finding such people can be tricky: For example, if you offer a standardized service, you need people who are good at selling products, not services. Take the case of Alex, who wants to specialize in logo design. This is a service, but he wants to sell it as a product with a standard process – meaning, his company follows the same production steps with each logo. As a result, he needs employees who are good at selling products. Typically, experienced service salespeople rely on consultative selling. That means they ask a lot of questions to find out what the clients needs. Consequently, clients expect them to provide individual solutions for their problems. But if you want to sell a standardized service, you can’t customize the product for each deal. That’s where product salespeople come in: These employees can influence the customer and make him believe that the standard product package is the perfect solution. Which is precisely what’s required for selling a standardized service. So once you have a smoothly running company that can operate independently of its owner, you can start thinking about how you’ll sell the business. How do you go about that? Who do you sell it to? And how do you get the best deal? Most entrepreneurs dream of one day selling their companies. But to pull off a sale and get the best deal, it’s essential to show potential buyers that you have a growing business with growing profits. One way to grow quickly is by finding big clients, but be careful about relying on them excessively. Why? Well, if you’re dependent on one big client, you’ll run into financial trouble anytime there’s an issue with the client’s payment. For example, 40 percent of Alex’s revenue came from MNY Bank. But one month, they were late on their payment, which made it difficult for Alex to pay monthly salaries and rent. Here’s another reason you shouldn’t rely on one big client: It puts you in a bad position to negotiate. From the perspective of a buying firm, that’s another major drawback. Why is this a disadvantage? Well, consider what happened when MNY Bank wanted to have something edited between Friday and Monday. Alex couldn’t risk losing a major client, so his designer was forced to work over the weekend. Eventually, the designer quits because of the unbearable working hours. Or another scenario: When Alex made the decision to specialize in logos, he took a big risk. If MNY Bank didn’t want logos, he would lose almost half of his revenue. As you can see, when your business is dependant on a bigger company, it limits your strategic decisions. This is especially unattractive to buyers, who want to develop a company and use its potential. No buying firm would want to acquire a small company that’s wholly dependant on a bigger company, especially because you’ll always have to do what the big company wants. If you don’t let big client companies force you into an overly dependant business relationship, your business will be far more attractive to buyers. In business, the customer is always right – but there are limits. Although every client might want a customized service, your small business will be better off if you offer standardized services. That’s because customized services are costly. From the first meeting to product delivery, the whole process can take months. And during that time, you’re not paid. That’s what happened to Alex. He had to edit some brochures for MNY Bank repeatedly because the client kept being dissatisfied with the results. It took ages for Alex to deliver the right product. And he wasn’t paid until he did. Thus, he struggled to find reserves to pay his monthly expenses. And there’s another benefit to standardized services: They give your business a better cash flow. Cash flow is the amount of money a firm has available in a certain period. It’s the difference between revenues and expenses, and it helps determine a company’s profitability. With standardized services, you’re paid upfront because the client knows what to expect from the final product. And that leads to positive cash flow, because you have money now and not in the future. Additionally, a positive cash flow is attractive from the perspective of buying firms, because it acts as a buffer if the company encounters larger unexpected expenses. Besides fostering positive cash flow, standardized services make it easier to estimate how long it’ll take to deliver a product, since you aren’t dependent on the customer. That way, you can better calculate how to allocate your time and resources. A calculated daily business is very attractive to buyers, because they can see that the company runs smoothly on its own. Finally, by limiting the number of times you meet with clients to tailor the work to their needs, you’re saving your company a lot of time. Up for a challenge? As an owner, it’s up to you to ensure that managers will want to stay with the company for a long time – even after it’s sold. Why is this so important? The purchasers will want to know that the firm will continue to succeed after its acquisition. And the management team plays a crucial role in that. In Alex’s case, he wanted to leave the company after the sale. That meant his management team had to run the company alone. Alex had three managers in charge of different departments. One was responsible for sales, one for designers and one for coordinating with the clients. If Alex left, those three managers would be the most important people in his company, because they oversaw all the daily tasks. If they stayed on, the business would continue to run as usual, so as the owner, Alex had to create incentives to retain them. One option is to give management equity, in the form of stock options. Stock options give managers the right to buy a specific amount of the company’s stock and therefore profit from its success. Stock options are a huge motivational tool because they make employees feel more invested in the company. However, stock options aren’t the best idea for smaller firms because they’re complicated to set up. So what’s an alternative? Long-term incentive plans that reward performance and loyalty are a better choice. For example, Ted told his friend Alex that he sets targets for his managers. When they reach their end-of-year targets, he pays them a bonus. He then matches the bonus with a sum he puts aside into a special fund. After three years, the employees are allowed to withdraw one third of the money – and so on, for each year after that. Thus, Ted ensures that management stays at the company. Ready to sell your company? Make sure you don’t overlook a crucial factor: the broker. The broker is the bridge between you and buyers. If he recommends you to the wrong companies, you won’t get a great price. What should you expect from your broker? The right broker will arrange discussions with different potential buyers. Consequently, the competition will result in a better price. Another benefit: you get to choose between buyers. Some companies buy for strategic reasons. That’s ideal for you because they’re more likely to pay a higher price, as well as give your business resources to grow. For example, Alex’s broker suggested they talk to printing companies, which might want to use his logo design business as a Trojan horse to get new clients – clients who would need printing services for their new logos. But other companies buy only for financial reasons. They want to see a return on investment, so they only care about quick financial success. These firms consider your price and the return they’ll get on it. They know they can buy any other potentially profitable firm, meaning they don’t care as much about your uniqueness or strategic outlook. So, a broker can play a major role in the successful sale of your company. But how do you choose one? It’s best to select a medium-sized broker firm. If it’s too big, your deal might not be so important for them and the broker won’t invest much time and effort to find the right buyer. On the other hand, if the firm is too small, the broker might not be respected by potential buyers. In that case, the negotiations also wouldn’t have a satisfying conclusion. Also, the right broker may have experience in your industry. Thus, he’ll know the landscape of competitors, the potentially interested firms and so on. It’s a big decision to make, but when you’re ready to sell your business, you need to start by writing a plan detailing your business model and expected cash flow. Bigger companies will use this to decide whether to acquire you, so it should present your firm in the best light. How should you do that? First: Think big! Make a three-year plan detailing what your company could achieve with unlimited resources. Why does this work? Well, the buying company will be larger than you are. It will have more employees, more resources and more money to run the business. With this added support, your company could achieve things it couldn’t on its own – including faster growth. This is a crucial point: The buying company wants to grow – that’s why it wants to acquire you. So tell them what’s possible and don’t be too modest. Here’s another thing that will present your company favorably to buyers: If your company concentrates on a standardized service, use words like “customers” and “business” rather than “clients” and “firm” when writing your plan. These small changes will make a big difference for buying firms. The word “clients” is associated with a normal service business and the word “customers” more with standardized businesses. Here’s why that matters: Service businesses are often acquired with a three- to five-year earn out. That means only a small amount of money is paid upfront. The rest comes later, if the company meets its goals. If not, the owner receives less money. The acquisition process for product businesses is different. The owners get the full amount of money upfront, without any earn out. This process involves less risk for the owner. If you’re an owner looking to sell your company, you probably want as much money as possible, now – not in a few years. Improve your chances with a well-written and savvy business plan. The key message in this book: Building a specialized service business attracts potential buyers. By hiring a robust sales force, growing a diverse roster of clients and creating strong incentives to reward management loyalty, you’re building a company that can be sold successfully.  Actionable advice: Standardize your service. When you sell a standardized product to someone, the process is straightforward: They pay and you deliver. That’s so much simpler than the back-and-forth that takes place when you’re dealing with a customized service, which can sometimes take months to deliver, from first meeting to final product. Standardizing also ensures that you’re paid immediately, which saves you the complicated financial issues involved with having to remain afloat until the client is satisfied enough with the product to deliver a payment. With cash coming in upfront, you’ll be able to keep your finances organized. Suggested further reading: The E-Myth Revisited by Michael E.

After all, where else could he have found out what the launch of the world’s ugliest car, a wink from a General Electric company executive, and the fall of the Piggly Wiggly supermarket chain have in common? These and the other events described in this book represent several major developments in US business history, the repercussions of which can still be felt today. They paved the way for things like the end of insider trading and an employee’s right to work for whomever he or she pleases. In these twelve exciting and surprising case studies, you’ll find: how Wall Street almost killed off Piggly Wiggly, why shareholder meetings of large companies are usually a complete farce, and how a misinterpreted wink landed some GE executives in court. How much can a person miss in three days? Well, if you happened to be a stock market investor who fell into a three-day coma on May 28, 1962, you might have woken up to almost no noticeable change in your investments, but you also would’ve slept straight through the chaos of the 1962 Flash Crash. This three-day turmoil neatly illustrates how bizarre the behavior of Wall Street bankers can be, and how investors are guided more by their mood than actual facts. On May 28, 1962, the mood on Wall Street was distinctly glum after six months of stock market decline. There was a lot of trading going on that morning, and the central office was running late in updating stock prices, as this was done manually. Investors panicked when they realized they could only know a stock’s true price with a time lag of some 45 minutes, by which time they assumed the true price had fallen. Consequently, they rushed to sell off their shares, which created a downward spiral in prices. Their expectations became self-fulfilling, causing a crash that annihilated $20 billion in stock value. But just as emotions triggered the crash, they also helped move along the recovery: investors considered it common knowledge that the Dow Jones Index, which measured the value of the general stock market, could not go below 500 points. So when the value came close to that limit, a buying panic broke out as everyone expected prices to go up. Three days after the crash, the market had fully recovered. After this bizarre event, everyone was searching for rational explanations. But all stock exchange officials could come up with was that the government needed to pay more attention to the prevailing “business climate,” i.e., the mood and irrational expectations, of the financial market. This inherent irrationality translates into the market’s unpredictability. In fact, the only thing that can be predicted about the market is, to quote famous banker J.P. Morgan: “It will fluctuate.” Have you ever heard of the Ford Edsel? Originally intended to be Ford’s flagship product in the late 1950s, the car not only ended up being one of the most spectacular product failures of all time but is also frequently cited as one of the ugliest cars ever made. How could a company as successful as Ford fail so dismally? For one, it completely miscalculated the market. In 1955, the American automobile market was booming. Families’ disposable income was increasing and people were becoming more interested in medium-priced cars, a segment in which Ford was weak. That’s when the company started planning the Ford Edsel. Unfortunately, by the time the Edsel was launched in 1958, the market had done a 180: an economic downturn and an abrupt change in consumer tastes had made people flock to smaller and cheaper car models. A second reason for the failure was that customers had unrealistic expectations for the car. Ford had spent $250 million on planning the Edsel, making it the company’s most expensive project up to that point – a fact that Ford promoted extensively in its marketing. This created a lot of buzz around the project, so when the Edsel was finally launched, consumers were expecting something revolutionary. However, they were disappointed to see that the Edsel was just another four-wheeled automobile after all. The third and final strike for the Edsel was its shoddy build. Since Ford had spent most of its efforts on carrying out psychological research to make the car appealing to its target group (i.e., young families with a disposable income), it neglected to fine-tune the technical side of the car. Consequently, once the product launched, customers found several faults, ranging from unreliable brakes to a jumpy acceleration. Although the Edsel might not have been a completely useless car in the end, it just couldn’t live up to its expectations. Warren Buffett is one of the richest people on the planet, and yet he admits that his tax rate is lower than his secretary’s (whose income, naturally, amounts to far less than his). Sound like a cruel joke? Well, it’s the perfect example of how unfair the US federal income tax system is. To understand how it got so bad, let’s examine the increasingly twisted development of the system since its inception. In 1913, after decades of political debate and fears that it was tantamount to socialism, the federal government began to levy an income tax. The reason was that its own income stream had run dry while its expenses were increasing. Initially, income tax rates were low and the main contributors were the richest citizens. Since then, rates have been raised continually and the application of the tax expanded to larger swathes of the population and, at the same time, more and more loopholes were created for the rich. These days, the income tax rates are generally quite high and have the greatest effect on the middle-class population. The way the tax is structured today encourages inefficiency. For example, freelancers will often stop taking on new contracts mid-way through the year just to not earn more income because, from a tax perspective, it makes more sense than earning more. What’s more, the complicated system of loopholes has made enforcing taxation a battle. The Internal Revenue Service, which collects the tax, must annually contend with an army of citizens’ tax advisers and lawyers whose speciality is circumventing the tax code. This is a colossal waste of human resources on both sides. Unfortunately though, tax reform is politically unfeasible. Multiple presidents have tried to reform the tax code into something simpler, but all have failed. The current system simply favors too many rich people with too much influence, and they don’t want to relinquish their advantages, such as capital gains being taxed less than salary income. So what’s the solution? The federal income tax system needs to be reset back to its 1913 state so we can try again. Imagine your uncle works for an oil company and he calls you up one day to tell you to invest in his company’s stock, as they’ve just struck oil and will only announce it tomorrow. Sounds like, if you bought the stock, you could end up doing time for insider trading, right? That would hold true today, but it wouldn’t necessarily have been that way before the Texas Gulf case. In 1959, a mineral company called Texas Gulf Sulphur hit the jackpot in the wilderness of Ontario, Canada. Their preliminary test drilling indicated hundreds of millions of dollars worth of copper, silver and other minerals in the ground. The people who knew about the find decided to keep quiet about it, stealthily buying shares in Texas Gulf. And as executives and other people in the know began buying shares, they instructed their relatives to do the same. When rumors spread that the company may have discovered something substantial, Texas Gulf held a press conference to actively downplay the hearsay and spread disinformation – as its own executives continued to buy shares. When the company finally announced the news about its find, the price of the shares skyrocketed and everyone who had bought the company’s stock got very wealthy. While this behavior wasn’t considered ethical, even by Wall Street standards, insider trading laws hadn’t ever been properly enforced before. This time though, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) took action: it charged Texas Gulf with deception and insider trading. This unprecedentedly bold step angered many investors. At the trial, the court had to decide whether or not the results of the test drilling had made the value of the find clear, and whether the company’s subsequent pessimistic press releases were deliberately misleading. In the end, the court issued a guilty verdict along with a statement that the public needs to be afforded a “reasonable opportunity to react” to any news that will affect share prices before company insiders can start trading shares. From then on, insider trading has been regulated and Wall Street has become a little cleaner. In the early 1960s, the automatic copy machine was a huge hit and the product’s developer, Xerox, suddenly became the market leader. But, within just a few years, the company experienced a huge downfall. Let’s take a look at Xerox’s rollercoaster ride in three stages. First, there was initial success against all the odds. Traditionally, people weren’t interested in copying documents because they felt like they were stealing original content. What’s more, the process was expensive, since the first copy machines would only run on specially treated paper. So when Xerox launched its first plain-paper photocopier in 1959, nobody expected a high demand for the product. The company’s founders even went so far as to discourage their friends and family from investing in the company. Yet in just six years, the company’s revenues had skyrocketed to $500 million. Second, there was sustained period of success. Xerox became so confident that it started investing heavily in philanthropy. As is fairly typical for an overnight success, the owners wanted to show their gratitude to those who had helped them and use their newly acquired position to influence society. For example, Xerox became the second-largest donor to the University of Rochester, which had originally helped develop photocopying technology. What’s more, the owners seemed to care a great deal for the United Nations. In 1964, they spent $4 million on a television campaign supporting the UN after it came under public attack by right-wing politicians. In the third stage, Xerox was forced to see how quickly success can turn into defeat. Shortly after reaching the peak of its glory in 1965, Xerox realized it was in trouble. The technological lead it had over competitors had diminished as they were producing cheaper copycat products. What’s more, new investments into research and development were ineffective, which left the company stranded. These three stages are a poignant example of the many stages a growth company can potentially go through. Luckily for Xerox, it survived the third stage and is still successful today. In late 1963, the brokerage company Ira Haupt & Co. was in trouble. It no longer had sufficient capital to trade in the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and its membership had to be revoked. The reason for this predicament was that the brokerage, which traded in commodities, had made a disastrous deal. It had bought cottonseed and soybean oil to be delivered at a later point in time and used the warehouse receipts as collateral to borrow money from the bank. Unfortunately, it turned out that the receipts had been doctored and the oil did not actually exist. Ira Haupt & Co. was suddenly the victim of large-scale commercial fraud and unable pay back the massive debt. After meeting with several banks, shareholders and the NYSE, it was found that Ira Haupt & Co. needed $22.5 million to become solvent again. To make matters worse, the entire nation was in a panic: President Kennedy had just been shot and the market was declining. But instead of letting Ira Haupt & Co. go bankrupt, the NYSE did something unprecedented: they saved the brokerage. The NYSE worried that the bankruptcy of Ira Haupt & Co. in a time of national panic would cause people to quickly lose faith in their investments and send Wall Street into a crash. They felt that the nation’s welfare depended on the survival of the brokerage, so they worked with the NYSE member firms and the brokerage’s creditors to hammer out a plan for Ira Haupt & Co. to pay back its debts. The NYSE itself pledged $7.5 million, almost a third of its total reserves. Together with other lenders it managed to save Ira Haupt. It is unlikely that we’ll ever see the NYSE make such a bold move ever again, but at the time it prevented a financial crisis in the heat of national panic. These days, whenever a company is mired in a scandal, they’ll claim that nobody did anything wrong – that the true culprit is “communication problems.” For example, if a company dumps toxic waste into an aquifer, it’s not out of greed, but because “The board failed to properly communicate the new environmental strategy to the local managers.” One case where this claim was put to the test was in the late 1950s when General Electric (GE) engaged in large-scale price fixing. No fewer than 29 electronics companies colluded to fix prices of $1.75 billion worth of machinery sold, with over a half a billion dollars coming from public institutions. The fixing could typically cost the customer as much as 25 percent more than normal price. When it turned out that GE was the ringleader of the price fixers, the scandalous matter was brought before the court and a senate subcommittee. Though some managers faced fines and prison terms, no higher level executives were charged. Why not? They claimed it was all due to a communication error: middle managers had misinterpreted their instructions. Apparently, at the time, there were two types of policies accepted at GE: official ones and implied ones. If executives gave you an order with a straight face, it was an official policy you should follow. But if they winked at you as they gave an order, the interpretation was up to you. Typically you were supposed to do the exact opposite of what was said, but other times you had to guess what the executive was implying. And if you failed to deduce what was implied, you’d be the one in trouble. Because of this, even though GE had a policy that forbade discussing prices with competitors, many managers assumed it was mere window dressing. But once they landed in court for the price fixing, they realized they couldn’t blame the executives. This story shows us that executives can, indeed, use communication problems to fend off responsibility for all manner of illegalities. Unless you live in the southern or midwestern United States, chances are you’ve never heard of Piggly Wiggly. Either way, in 1917, it patented the concept of the self-service supermarket. It was the first supermarket to, for example, provide shoppers with shopping carts, put price tags on all the items and have check-out stands. Piggly Wiggly still operates today, but is relatively unknown due to the actions of its eccentric owner Clarence Saunders, who went to great lengths to fight financial speculation. In the 1920s, Piggly Wiggly was rapidly expanding throughout the United States. But when a couple of franchises in New York failed in 1923, some investors tried to take advantage of this by starting a bear raid against Piggly Wiggly. A bear raid is a strategy where investors make investments that only turn a profit if a company’s stock price falls and then do everything in their power to force the price of the stock down. In Piggly Wiggly’s case, they claimed the whole company was in trouble due to the failed New York franchises. Saunders was furious and wanted to teach Wall Street a lesson: he started an attempt to corner Piggly Wiggly’s stock, meaning he wanted to buy back the majority of it. And he almost succeeded. He announced publicly that he would buy all existing stock in Piggly Wiggly and, after borrowing heavily, managed to buy back 98 percent of the shares. This drove up the stock price from $39 to $124 per share: a catastrophe for the bear raiders, who faced enormous losses when the price rose. However, the raiders managed to convince the stock exchange to grant them an extension on paying up. Saunders’ position was not tenable due to his debts, and he eventually suffered such large losses he was forced to declare bankruptcy. If only Saunders would’ve had more influence over the stock exchange, you might be wiggling yourself through the aisles of a Piggly Wiggly instead of shopping at a big box store like Wal-Mart. When a highly influential government bureaucrat jumps over to the business world and leverages his old government connections to make money, many people are likely to accuse him of being a sell-out. But in the case of David Lilienthal, this wouldn’t be an appropriate accusation. In the 1930s, Lilienthal was a good civil servant under the reformist President Roosevelt. Then, in 1941, he was appointed chairman of the Tennessee Valley Authority, an entity in charge of developing and distributing cheap hydroelectric power in areas that private providers didn’t cover. Later, in 1947, he served as the first chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, emphasizing the importance of the peaceful civilian use of nuclear power. And, when he finally left public office In 1950, he was honest about his motivation for the move, saying he wanted to make more money so he could provide for his family and save for his own retirement. Once he entered the private sector, Lilienthal also proved himself a committed businessman. His background in energy made him well-suited for the mineral industry and, since he wanted to experience the trials of entrepreneurship, he took over the severely ailing Minerals and Chemical Corporation of America. He succeeded in bringing the company back to life from the brink of failure and earned a small fortune as a result. His new line of work also influenced his own opinions: he wrote a controversial book about why big business is important for the economy and security of the United States. His old government colleagues accused him of being a sell-out, but Lilienthal was merely highly committed to both sides of the coin. Eventually, Lilienthal decided that he wanted the best of both worlds and, in 1955, founded the Development and Resources Corporation, a consultancy that helped developing countries carry out major public works programs. This latest endeavor proves that Lilienthal really is the ideal businessman: accountable in equal measure to both shareholders and humanity. Who do you think are the most powerful people in America? In theory, it should be the stockholders. Especially given the fact that they own the largest corporations in America and these giant companies wield such great power in American society that many political scientists have suggested that the United States resembles an oligarchic feudal system more than a democracy. These major corporations are always led by a board of directors elected by the shareholders, giving the shareholders the true power. Once a year, shareholders come together for an annual meeting in order to elect the board, vote on policies and question the executives who run the company. But, far from being the dignified, serious events you might imagine, these meetings are generally a complete farce. That’s because the company’s management doesn’t really feel that the shareholders are their bosses. They make it hard for shareholders to come to meetings by holding them far away from the company’s headquarters. At the meetings, they try to to keep the shareholders from getting involved by droning on about the company’s great performance and future. This tactic works with most shareholders. The only thing that makes these meetings interesting are the professional investors who challenge the company board and management into a debate. One comic example was seen in AT&T’s 1965 shareholders’ meeting, when investor Wilma Soss berated the chairman of the board Frederick Kappel and even suggested he see a psychiatrist. Professional investors like Soss often own stock in many companies and thus want to hold them accountable for their actions. In this case, Soss was fighting to get more women on the board of directors. But trying to rouse apathetic investors is a thankless job: there is nothing more passive and compliant than a small investor who is fed dividends regularly. If shareholders only wielded their power more often, company management could not simply do as they please. If one day you were to receive a highly tempting job offer from a competitor of your current employer, you’d be able to accept it, right? Actually, your right to do so was not always so clear, and you have a research scientist named Donald Wohlgemuth to thank for setting the precedent that allows you to do as you please. In 1962, Wohlgemuth managed the space suit engineering department of the aerospace company B.F. Goodrich Company. The market for space-related products was growing fast during the race for the moon, and Goodrich was the market leader in space suits. At the time, though, the company had just lost the contract for the now famous Apollo project to its main competitor International Latex. So when Wohlgemuth received an offer from International Latex to work on the prestigious Apollo project with more responsibility and a larger salary, he accepted without delay. But when Wohlgemuth told his superiors at B.F. Goodrich that he was leaving, they feared that he would divulge the secrets he had learned about space suit production. Due to this fear and the fact that Wohlgemuth had originally signed a confidentiality agreement, B.F. Goodrich then sued Wohlgemuth. When the controversial matter went to court, two key questions of near-philosophical nature arose: If someone hasn’t ever broken an agreement or shown the intention of doing so, can action be taken against them on the assumption that they will? Should someone be prohibited from pursuing a position that would tempt them to commit a crime? In a groundbreaking decision, the judge ruled that while Wohlgemuth clearly was in a position to harm Goodrich by sharing what he knew, he could not be found guilty of it preemptively, and so was free to enter into employment with International Latex. This decision formed the precedent for similar rulings, making it a great victory for employee rights. In the 1960s, of all the currencies of the world, the British pound sterling was perhaps one of the most prestigious due to its old age and high value. So when the pound came under attack from financial speculators in 1964, central bankers around the world felt obliged to defend it. The roots of the attack go back to the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944, when the major economies of the world decided to build an international monetary exchange system where all currencies were exchangeable at fixed rates. This meant that, to maintain these fixed rates, governments had to often intervene in the currency exchange market by buying or selling currencies. In 1964, Britain found itself in economic difficulties: it was running a large trade deficit. Currency speculators believed that Britain could not keep up the fixed currency exchange rates and would be forced to devalue the pound. Consequently, they started betting against the pound in the market: they wanted its value to fall. Faced not only with the threat to the prestigious pound sterling but also to the international monetary exchange system itself, a broad alliance of monetary policy makers led by the US Federal Reserve mounted a defense. They started to buy pounds to counteract the pressure to devalue the currency. Initially, it seemed as if the tactic was working, and the first waves of attacks were fended off. But the speculators were persistent, continuing their attacks for years. Finally, in 1967, the alliance could not afford to buy more pounds, and Britain was forced to devalue the currency by over 14 percent. In hindsight, the war over the valuation of the pound sterling was merely the first sign of the inherent shortcomings of the Bretton Woods system, which would come to an end just four years later in 1971. The key message in this book: In many cases, how we understand the financial market and business ethics can be traced back to key incidents in history. One man’s fight to change employers, for example, made a lasting impact on employee rights.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

Making it a reality, though, is a whole different ballgame. To attain your goal, you will likely have to work very long hours for a quite a few years. But even hard work does not always yield fruit. Start-ups often go bust after three to five years of continued efforts, while many dedicated business professionals end up spending long hours in the office without having anything to show for it in the end. This happens because success must be carefully planned. These blinks will show you that you’ll need short-term, intermediate and long-term goals, and also identify the right tools to reach your goals. You’ll also learn how to stay excited about big hairy audacious goals; how to recognize the best opportunities in your business environment; and how to create a focus for your company that will ensure its success. Have you heard the term Big Hairy Audacious Goals, or BHAGs? It was coined by Jerry I. Porras and Jim Collins in their book Built to Last. To qualify as a BHAG, a goal needs to meet four criteria: It needs to be very big, take years to accomplish, be a little bit elusive in terms of the best way to attain it and must be easy to identify if it’s been achieved or not. Consider Wal-Mart. Following World War II, the company’s founder, Sam Walton, set a remarkably bold goal; he wanted to turn his tiny variety store in Newport, Arkansas into the most profitable one in the entire state. Since he was primarily selling cheap T-shirts and fishing rods at the time, this was a pretty audacious goal. It also wasn’t something he could achieve in a matter of months, and it wasn’t immediately clear how he could set about doing it. Finally, in terms of verifying his potential accomplishment, it would be easy to check the size and profit of his growing business against other stores in Arkansas. By 1948, Walton had achieved his incredible vision – his store was the most profitable of any variety store in Arkansas. From there, he just kept setting goals and, decades down the line, by 2002, Wal-Mart had become the largest company on the face of the earth. So, do as Sam did and identify your own BHAG. But a BHAG is not necessarily about growing your company; it can also be related to a specific product or project. In 1934, Walt Disney set out to create the very first animated, feature-length film. No one in the industry believed in this bold project because animation was only considered suitable for short films. History proved them wrong. Disney reached his goal when Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was released in 1938. People loved it. And even though Disney’s original goal hadn’t been revenue, the film did generate massive returns. Next up, you’ll learn about two key concepts that are at the foundation of your business. Imagine your dream is to build a cathedral. To achieve this incredible goal, would you hire people who simply know how to lay bricks or people who are wholeheartedly committed to building a stunning architectural masterpiece. Probably the latter, right? After all, having a unifying purpose is essential to forging commitment and building a thriving business. This central motivation is called a core purpose and it’s key to reaching your goals. For instance, as an architect, your core purpose might be to beautify cities or to build environmentally sustainable houses. Simply put, your core purpose infuses your work with meaning, while gathering energy and solidifying commitments in the process. This is an important factor since the more committed a team is, the more likely they are to achieve extraordinary results. In fact, the employee research firm ISR found that companies with an engaged workforce are more productive and profitable overall. So, your core purpose is a fundamental aspect of achieving your stated goals, but so are your core values. These values constitute your company’s moral compass; they ensure consistent decision making and guide your hiring and firing practices. In other words, your core values dictate how your company operates. Say you run a taxi company. Your core values might be summed up by the phrase, the right route is the right route. Such a value will indicate that your team doesn’t take detours to jack up fares. By stating this up front, you’ll keep your team on solid moral footing and ensure that they are committed to making the right decisions. But your values will also guide who is on your team in the first place. If it turns out that an employee doesn’t believe in the values you stand for, it is clearly the right decision to let them go. Imagine you’ve invested every last drop of your ingenuity into creating a deli that only sells broccoli jam. Your business could be perfectly organized and seamlessly run, but it wouldn’t matter if nobody wants what you’re selling. So, how do you determine which products will sell? By scanning your environment with a PEST analysis. This acronym, which stands for Political, Economic, Social and Technological, is a tool to define external factors that will impact your industry. To begin with, consider political circumstances that might impact your business, both today and down the line. From there, ask yourself, given the political opportunities and threats you can identify, which strategies should you adopt to succeed both in the present day and the future? For instance, in the 1960s, Sam Walton analyzed the environment Wal-Mart was entering. He realized that the US government was making a number of infrastructural investments, one of which was the creation of more roads. He therefore knew that it would become easier for customers to reach his stores and that it was a good time to open new locations. Next, you should consider economic factors that’ll influence your business and ask yourself the same question about the economic climate as you did about the political one. Sam Walton remains a good example as, in the years following World War II, he saw the economy surging and knew it was an opportune time to launch a new business. From there, it’s essential to take into account social elements that’ll impact your company. To do so, consider how people, your employees and, in particular, your customers act and think. Ask questions like, is the population getting older or younger? When Walton was starting out, it was clear that more people were having children. He saw that the baby boom would eventually result in more potential customers and was another cue that the time was right to grow. Finally, consider technological changes that might occur and how they could affect your business. Which technologies are currently trending? If a new technology like, say, flying bicycles was to hit the market tomorrow, how would it affect your business? Now that you’ve asked the right questions and set the stage, you’re ready to make some bigger decisions – which is exactly what you’ll learn about next. If you want to stand out in a crowd, all you’ve got to do is dye your hair pink and spike it into a mohawk. But standing out in the world of business requires a bit more thought. To do so, you need to identify your value discipline, the thing that makes you different from the competition and guarantees you a leading role in your industry. There are three different value disciplines to choose from and it’s up to you to pick the one that fits you best. First, there’s operational excellence, which basically means that you have low costs. Second is product leadership, which is all about creating the newest and best products. And third, there’s customer intimacy, which implies that you produce solutions that are perfectly tailored to the problems your customers face. But regardless of which approach you choose, all three of these value disciplines should keep you focused on the unique difference that makes you stand out. Let’s return to Sam Walton. Back in the early 60s, he began building his empire and decided to focus on offering the low-cost option. Specifically, he made the decision to spend some of his own savings to be able to offer rock bottom prices to his customers. His goal was for Wal-Mart to be the store that everybody could afford; in the end, that’s exactly how the company differentiated itself and became such a resounding success. Then, once you’ve chosen your value discipline, you can use it to identify your core activities. These are the strategic actions you take to keep yourself on the path toward your goals. Imagine you decide to focus on low prices as Walton did. Other factors like product development and customer service will soon become less important, as they’re not essential to reaching your goals. Identifying this will allow you to deliberately allocate fewer resources to these unnecessary elements and instead focus on getting better deals from wholesalers to lower your retail prices. By doing so, you’ll be syncing your core activities with your value discipline. Now that you’ve got the basics in order, you’re ready to build the messages you need to bring in prospective customers and beat out the competition. You might be thinking, what’s a good goal to set for your business? Well, it’s actually a difficult question to answer, since words like “good” are quite abstract and can mean entirely different things to different people. This is precisely why it’s crucial to come up with concrete ways of measuring your business’s progress – and numerical targets are an ideal method. Numbers make progress more tangible and, therefore, easier to monitor. Say two of your targets in the coming years are to build two more branch offices and acquire ten more resellers. Once you’ve set such goals, you can track the numbers you’re putting up and have your whole team monitor the progress. But that’s not all. You’ll also need to identify your key performance indicators, or KPIs. These all-important markers of success keep track of performance in essential areas and help you predict financial success. For example, if you’re in the construction business and notice a correlation between higher numbers of proposals and an increase in income, you might want to track the number of building proposals you submit as a KPI. Or, if your industry is pharmaceutical sales, you might track the number of weekly physician's visits that your sales representatives make because you know it has been a key indicator of your business success in the past. By now you have some strong strategies for business success, but if you want to reach your BHAGs, you’ll need to be serious about maintaining progress. In that fight, losing focus and wasting time are your biggest enemies – so here are some tactics to overcome them: First, conducting meetings is central to maintaining forward momentum, as they establish a clear rhythm for your business. While the idea of holding many meetings can be daunting, in general, they give you time to pause and reassess your direction; these regular moments of reflection can quickly become essential to a thriving business. One meeting that’s particularly important is the quarterly strategic review. It should happen every three months to give your team the opportunity to look back on the work you did and assess the last quarter. It’s a time to consider what you’ve achieved, review new projects on the docket and take a look at any surprises that came up. By assessing all these factors, you can double-check that everything you’re doing is in line with your goals. From there, you can use this information to perform what’s called a SWOT Analysis, which is a convenient way to map the current status of your strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. For instance, one of your strengths might be an expert on your team, while a weakness could be your failure to make enough sales. An opportunity might be the bankruptcy of a key competitor, which opens the door for you to bring in more customers, and a threat might be a pending merger between companies that, together, could poach many of your customers. From there, you can use your quarterly review and SWOT analysis to plan for the future and choose the projects you’ll be launching in the next quarter. Imagine you identify a few threats and weaknesses during your SWOT analysis. It’s probably in your best interests to address these in the next quarter; then, once you’ve gone through damage control, you can look at which new projects you want to take on to stay on top of your overarching, ultimate goals. The key message in this book: Creating a successful business requires a winning strategy that enables you to set the right goals and actually reach them – but that’s easier said than done. To pick the right strategy, you’ll need to do some careful thinking and analysis first, after which you’ll have to monitor your progress carefully. Actionable Advice Involve your entire team in strategic research. When analyzing your business, including the PEST analysis, ask everyone in your team for their opinion. With more minds involved, it’ll be easier to identify the most important aspects in need of consideration and pin down a winning strategy. So involve everyone you can in this process and don’t go it alone – you might miss something important. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

The first of these conflicts, the campaign to expel Iraqi forces from Kuwait in 1991, resulted in a decisive triumph. The second and third, the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003, weren’t nearly as clear-cut.  The US military didn’t want to repeat the mistake the Soviet Union made in Afghanistan in the 1980s, getting stuck in an endless guerilla war. Consequently, the Taliban regime was successfully overthrown, though Osama bin Laden was allowed to escape. In Iraq, a swift military victory was followed by years of bloodshed.  So what did the US get right in the first conflict, and what went wrong in its later campaigns? Few people are better placed to decipher American strategy than Jim Mattis, a general who commanded Marines in all three wars. In these blinks, we’ll follow Mattis through his career in the Marines and explore the thinking behind US military planning.  Along the way, you’ll find out how Mattis used amphibious troops to establish a bridgehead in a landlocked country; why disbanding the Iraqi army after the 2003 invasion was a huge mistake; and  how the withdrawal of American forces from Iraq in 2011 led to the formation of ISIS.  In the winter of 1971, a free-spirited history graduate named Jim Mattis had a brush with death. Fresh out of college and unsure what to do next, Mattis took to the hills of Washington state for a hiking trip. He was standing on an icy ridge looking down at the Columbia River when he slipped and tumbled down a ravine. The fall could have easily killed him. Amazingly, he escaped with just a few cracked ribs.  Mattis had spent the last two summers training at the Marine Officer Candidates School. As he dusted himself off in that icy ravine, he recalled a Vietnam veteran at the school who had said, “We don’t get to choose when we die, but we can choose how we meet death.” This was a life-changing moment. Mattis realized he wanted to spend his career around men like that wise soldier.  The Marines stood for two things – duty and adventure. Both gelled with Mattis’ upbringing. Born in 1950 in Richland, Washington, he grew up around soldiers and military engineers. They had come to the area to oversee the construction of the Hanford reactors – a nuclear production complex vital to the Manhattan Project, America’s plan to build an atomic bomb during World War II. Their civic-minded patriotism and dedication deeply influenced Richland.  Meanwhile, Mattis’ parents encouraged their son’s sense of adventure. As a boy, he hunted rabbits in the surrounding hills with an old .22 rifle. At 13, he began hitchhiking across America’s western states. When he was home, he devoured the books in his parents’ extensive library. Hemingway was a favorite, Faulkner a close second. In 1968, Mattis enrolled at Central Washington State College. He was a mediocre student and spent more time partying than studying history. After one incident, a judge even ordered him to spend weekends in the local jail – a punishment for underage drinking.  The summer officer training program in Quantico, Virginia, provided something that university hadn’t – a sense of purpose. Led by sergeants who had just returned from Vietnam, the course pushed Mattis to his limits. But he was stubborn. When he was offered an airline ticket home, an invitation to take the easy way out, he refused. Over half the class was screened out each summer. Mattis stayed the course. As he later realized in that ravine, this was his calling.  Mattis was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Marines in early 1972. Unlike Army, Navy and Air Force officers, Marine officers begin their career with seven months of basic infantry training. The idea behind this is simple – every Marine, whatever his rank, is first and foremost a rifleman.  After completing his training in Quantico, Mattis joined the 2nd Battalion, 4th Marine regiment stationed in Okinawa, Japan. This was a turbulent time for the US military.  American troops had entered Vietnam in 1965 and, as their numbers grew, more and more conscripted men were sent to join them. The war had become deeply unpopular at home by the time Mattis began his career in the early 1970s. Hoping to defuse anti-war sentiment, the government abolished conscription and introduced an all-volunteer army in 1973. After this, petty criminals and dropouts flocked to the military. Drug use and racial tension eroded discipline. Leaders now needed to be tougher than ever before. As one of Mattis’ early mentors, Corporal Johnson, put it, officers had to be “harder than a petrified woodpecker’s lips.” Mattis followed that advice and quickly established himself as an effective leader. Looking back, he attributes this to three factors – competence, care and conviction.  To lead Marines, you have to be brilliant at the basics. If an officer can’t run three miles in 18 minutes, shoot straight or swiftly call in artillery support, the soldiers he expects to complete these tasks won’t respect him. War, after all, is full of random danger and demands that leaders get the simple things right.  That said, competence alone isn’t enough. As Teddy Roosevelt once put it, “nobody cares how much you know until they know how much you care.” This doesn’t mean that officers should treat their subordinates as friends, however. Like coaches, they help them grow into their roles and become effective in their own right.  The best leaders also display conviction. That’s all about stating your rules and sticking to them, without favoritism. In military slang, these are called “flat-ass rules” – orders that apply to everyone at all times. An officer who embodies this kind of conviction is well-placed to win the most important campaign of all – the battle for his men’s hearts.  By 1990, Mattis had spent 18 years in the army. That made him a “totus porcus” or “full hog” Marine – a military man through and through. Promoted to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, he had recently been given command of the 1st Battalion of the 7th Marine regiment. It wouldn’t be long before he led its men into a new battle.  On August 2, 1990, the Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein invaded neighboring Kuwait, a small oil-rich state claimed by Iraq. Hussein believed that no one would come to Kuwait’s assistance. He was wrong. Three days after the Iraqi invasion, President George H.W. Bush told reporters that the US would not allow this act of aggression to stand.  Mattis received a call from his regimental commander that very evening. The First Gulf War had begun, and America was entering the fray – it was time to stand and deliver.  The 1st Battalion would be the first unit to engage the Iraqi army and begin the campaign to liberate Kuwait. Their mission? Breach Iraqi “obstacle belts” – minefields reinforced with barbed wire, defensive trenches and bunkers – and open a corridor for the US Army to sweep into the country.  The assault began on February 24, 1991. Mattis was in command of a force of 1,250 Marines and 18 tanks. Breaching Iraq’s defenses had taken 21 minutes during war game rehearsals in the Saudi Arabian desert the previous year. On the actual day, it took the 1st Battalion just eleven minutes.  Mattis surveyed his Marines’ progress through the hatch of an armored command vehicle. His preparation and drills paid off – it was a rout. Few Iraqi soldiers offered more than half-hearted resistance. More tenacious units were incinerated in concentrated artillery fire and air support.  By the end of the day, over 20,000 US troops had poured through the corridors opened by Mattis’ men. Three days later, Hussein’s forces were in disarray and beating a retreat. By February 28, Kuwait had been liberated. Mattis’ unit hadn’t lost a single Marine in the fight.  The First Gulf War was a model military campaign in Mattis’ eyes. The US had clear objectives and took every action necessary to achieve them. After their victory, US forces returned home rather than getting bogged down in endless skirmishes. Future US wars would be very different. The morning of September 11, 2001, started like any other. Mattis had recently been promoted to deputy commander of I Marine Expeditionary Force, or 1 MEF. He was driving to his unit’s base in Camp Pendleton, California. That’s when radio stations started reporting that an airplane had hit the World Trade Center in New York.  Mattis instantly guessed what had happened. His first thought? They got through. His second thought? This was the handiwork of Al Qaeda – an Islamist terror group that declared war on America in the mid-1990s and orchestrated attacks on US targets across Africa and the Middle East.  American intelligence knew that Osama bin Laden, Al Qaeda’s leader, was being hosted by Mullah Omar, the head of Afghanistan’s Islamist Taliban government. On October 7, 2011, President George W. Bush ordered airstrikes against Al Qaeda and the Taliban. 1 MEF was put on a war footing and sent to Egypt to await further orders. Mattis and his men were desperate to join the fight and avenge the victims of the September 11 attacks, but there was a hitch. Tommy Franks, America’s leading general, didn’t believe the seaborne Marines had any part to play in the war in Afghanistan. As he put it during a briefing, “there’s no doubt about it, guys – this sonofabitch is landlocked.” This, Mattis thought, was an outdated view. Why? Well, the Marines didn’t need literal beaches to land troops. Their long-range helicopters allowed them to open bridgeheads – secured positions inside enemy territory – in any country in the world.  His argument fell on deaf ears, with one notable exception – Vice Admiral Willy Moore, the commander of the US Navy’s Fifth Fleet in the Persian Gulf. Moore knew that American airstrikes were pushing Taliban and Al Qaeda forces south. Unable to hold Afghanistan’s capital, Kabul, a city that had never been successfully defended, they had retreated to the country’s second-largest settlement – Kandahar.  If they were allowed to dig in over the winter, Moore claimed, a spring offensive would be a bloodbath. The only alternative was to strike now before Kandahar could be fortified. The plan the two men hatched was as simple in theory as it was complex to execute. They would fly 4,000 Marines over Pakistani airspace, land them on a dusty plain 90 miles southwest of Kandahar, codenamed Rhino, and establish a new front in the war against terrorism.  A few days after Thanksgiving in November 2001, Mattis was standing on the deck of a helicopter carrier in the Arabian Sea near the Pakistani coast. He watched as Marines test-fired their weapons into the water and loaded CH-53 helicopters. Centcom – US Central Command – had given the green light. The mission to establish a bridgehead in southern Afghanistan was a go.  The first troops landed at 9:00 p.m. on November 25. Within an hour, 170 grunts were in position to defend the landing site. By dawn the following day, 400 additional soldiers equipped with gun trucks had joined them. It was the deepest amphibious assault from the sea in history. The result was Camp Rhino, one of the war’s most important bases.  It was a devastating blow to Al Qaeda and the Taliban. They had gambled on drawing down their forces in the north and building up a defensive cordon in the south to repel an invasion. Now, their enemy was within striking distance of their makeshift capital, Kandahar. Overnight, a position of grim hope had become hopeless.  Meanwhile, the Taliban’s Afghan opponents, the Northern Alliance, had the wind in their sails. Afghanistan’s first post-Taliban president, Alliance commander Hamid Karzai, later told Mattis that he heard about Camp Rhino as his forces converged on Kandahar. When he saw the headline in the digital edition of the New York Times, he went out and shouted to his troops that the war was all but won. By December, the Taliban had indeed been overthrown. It was a triumph, but Mattis wasn’t happy. Bin Laden had slipped the noose and was hiding out in Tora Bora, a cave complex near the Pakistani border which had sheltered guerillas during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in the 1980s. Mattis’ Marines were ideally placed to lead the charge, but Centcom commander General Franks ordered them to stay in Camp Rhino.  His reasoning? The US should avoid repeating the Soviets’ mistake of getting caught up in a guerilla war. As Franks put it in his memoir, there was “nothing to be gained by blundering around those mountains with armor battalions chasing a lightly armed enemy.”  Mattis pointed out that he wouldn’t be using armor, but highly mobile, helicopter-borne Marines. He was overruled, and President Bush deferred to Franks. The opportunity to capture bin Laden was lost. It would be a decade before another chance presented itself.  By early 2002, Mattis was back in Pendleton, California. A freshly promoted two-star Major General, he now commanded the 1st Marine Division. There was little time to mull over the missed opportunity to pursue bin Laden in Tora Bora. The US was gearing up to take on another old foe – Saddam Hussein.  While he was honored to lead the 1st Marine Division, a storied unit which had served with distinction in Japan, Korea and Vietnam, Mattis was uneasy about the decision to invade Iraq. Sanctions had crippled the country’s economy, and the US controlled Iraqi airspace. Even if Hussein did possess chemical weapons – the government’s justification for the impending war – Iraq was boxed in. Was it really a threat? That kind of question, Mattis realized, wasn’t his to answer. As a soldier serving his country, his role was to execute the decisions made by elected politicians, however wise or foolish they were. And that’s just what he did. In August 2002, he instructed his officers to put their domestic affairs in order, make peace with their God and prepare themselves for war. Over the next seven months, Mattis and his senior staff staged elaborate war games on a massive map of Iraq pinned to the flight deck of an aircraft carrier. The purpose of these exercises was to ensure that his Marines were well-supplied and that humanitarian aid could flow to civilians once the fighting was done.  Mattis anticipated that would be soon. Tony Zinni, a retired general and a mentor to Mattis, joked that he would disown his protégé if he wasn’t in Baghdad within six weeks. Sweeping the Iraqi army aside ought to be a breeze. The real challenge was what came next.  On March 20, 2003, a day after the official commencement of Operation Iraqi Freedom, Mattis entered Iraq. His Marines made rapid progress. The heaviest fighting came three weeks into the campaign as they entered Baghdad, with one battalion suffering 81 deaths and injuries in a single night.  Despite the determined resistance of its soldiers in the capital, the Iraqi army was incapable of holding out for long. By April 12, Saddam Hussein had been deposed, and US forces controlled most of Iraq. As Zinni predicted, military victory had been swift. He was also right that this was just the beginning. Chaos descended on Iraq as Saddam Hussein’s regime crumbled. Police officers disappeared from the streets, while water and electricity failed. Religious tensions between Iraq’s majority Shiites and minority Sunnis threatened to escalate into a civil war. The US had won the fight. Now, it would have to keep the peace.  The Iraqi army was the key piece in this puzzle. Why was that? Well, its defeat had left thousands of well-trained and battle-hardened young men at loose ends, with neither jobs nor prospects. Like many US commanders in the field, Mattis believed this was a disaster waiting to happen. If immediate action wasn’t taken, it was only a matter of time before someone turned this ready-made guerilla force against American troops.  One of Mattis’ senior officers devised a plan to forestall this nightmare scenario – pay Iraqi soldiers to return to their barracks and wait to be enrolled into a new Iraqi army. Mattis agreed, but Paul Bremer, the leader of the provisional authority established by the US to oversee the reconstruction of Iraq, didn’t. He decided to disband the Iraqi army and ban members of the ruling Baath party from holding public office.  Bremer’s policy didn’t distinguish between diehard Baathist loyalists and opportunistic officers, engineers and technocrats who had joined the party to further their careers. It was a fateful decision that would set some of the country’s most capable – and dangerous – men against the US.  There were other mix-ups, too. Military commanders like Mattis were instructed to prepare for local elections in the areas their forces were holding. This was a slow and difficult process, but they were making headway. Then, the provisional authority suddenly pressed for immediate elections. Mattis and his colleagues reluctantly agreed and urged tribal and local leaders to encourage rapid elections in their communities. When the authority once again switched course and postponed elections, military leaders had to sheepishly explain this reversal. At the end of a long, hot summer, Mattis returned to the US. He had helped depose Saddam Hussein’s dictatorship, but Iraq’s future was uncertain. The British military strategist B. H. Liddell Hart once wrote that the object of war is to create a “better state of peace.” Mattis left the country doubting that he had done that. In February 2004, Mattis wrote a letter to the soldiers in the 1st Marine Division to tell them that “we are going back into the brawl.” Since his departure the previous fall, things had gone from bad to worse in Iraq. A new group calling itself Al Qaeda in Iraq – AQI – was at the heart of a growing insurgency in Anbar, a Sunni-dominated province west of Baghdad.  Led by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, AQI was based in Anbar’s two largest cities, Ramadi and Fallujah, and was waging a war against American troops and rival religious groups. A month before Mattis arrived in Anbar, one of Zarqawi’s suicide bombers killed 23 Iraqi police recruits in Fallujah. It was his job to put an end to these attacks. But how? Mattis attempted to de-escalate the situation and instructed his troops to behave as they would in the US, rather than arrogant occupiers. That meant removing their sunglasses when talking to locals, asking for permission to enter homes rather than kicking doors down and holding their fire when civilians were in the area – anything it took to avoid alienating normal Iraqis. Mattis’ superiors saw things differently. While commanders on the ground were confident they could get a handle on things with this strategy, politicians in Washington were panicking. When a group of American contractors was ambushed, their burned corpses suspended from a bridge in Fallujah in late March, President Bush called for a forceful response. The US, he said, needed to be “tough as hell.” Fallujah was in the cross-hairs.  As Mattis pointed out, assaulting the city might cement local support for the insurgents. But once again, he put his personal views aside and prepared for the job at hand. His only request was that the attack not be halted once it had begun.  This request wouldn’t be granted. Marines entered Fallujah on April 4, 2004. This set off a domino reaction, and fighting exploded across the country. Media images of civilian casualties from inside the city rippled around the world. It was too much for the United Nations, which threatened to pull its representatives out of Iraq entirely unless the assault was ended.  By April 10, 1st Marine Division had insurgents on the run. Mattis informed Centcom that he could finish Zarqawi off once and for all. He was ordered to hang back. After a two-year break from the front, Mattis returned to Iraq in early 2006 as the commander 1 Marine Expeditionary Force. The mood in Washington was souring, and politicians claimed that the Iraq war had been lost. Mattis was determined to prove them wrong.  AQI’s rule in Anbar not only threatened American soldiers but the tribes living in the province as well. Over the summer of 2006, Mattis and his fellow commanders cultivated ties with tribal leaders. Both parties wanted AQI gone, but neither was sure they could trust the other. Small gestures of friendship, like presenting sheiks with Marine officer dress swords when they went to the US side, took on huge symbolic importance.  These bottom-up relationships between local leaders and US battalions laid the foundations for the Anbar Awakening – a realignment of Sunni leaders in the province that resulted in them fighting AQI alongside the US. By the end of the year, Mattis was confident that both Anbar and Iraq could be stabilized. As he put it in a press interview, “I think it will take five years. Over that period, we will see a decline in enemy effectiveness.” He was right. After investing seven years of blood and treasure in Iraq, the American war had finally achieved sustainable peace and established a viable Iraqi state by late 2010. That left one question – what next? Mattis was aware that American intelligence predicted chaos and civil war if troops immediately withdrew. US troops were the glue holding Iraq together – remove them, and everything would fall apart.  But President Obama was determined to end the war for good. In October 2011, he announced that all US troops would be leaving the country by the end of the year, promising to leave behind a “stable and self-reliant Iraq.” The reality was very different. Iraq slipped back into violence within months of the withdrawal. The Sunni minority revolted against the Shiite-dominated central government, and the new Iraqi army proved incapable of stopping them. By 2014, a new Islamist group called ISIS had emerged from the chaos and set up its own murderous caliphate. It would take years of fighting, thousands of casualties and the misery of millions of innocents to roll ISIS back. All of this was predicted and preventable. The key message in these blinks: Jim Mattis joined the Marines in 1970, a difficult time for the military. Attempting to defuse anti-war protests, the US abandoned conscription and moved to an all-volunteer force. That required a new breed of leader. Mattis rose to the occasion and quickly advanced through the ranks. In 1990, he led the first Marines to enter Kuwait. This was a model military campaign, unlike the two later conflicts Mattis participated in – Afghanistan and Iraq. Outdated thinking, bad calls and mix-ups all undermined US efforts in these wars.

So companies started hiring coaches to ensure that their employees reached their full potential. But have you ever asked yourself: from where did coaching appear? Coaching developed from existing support-oriented professions like counselling and psychotherapy that are based on certain core-principles, such as being non-directive, and helping clients find their own solutions. These principles are effective for helping people in need of care, but are they effective in the case of coaching? Challenging Coaching argues that this approach might have led self-obsessed financial traders to focus only on their own personal rewards – with catastrophic results for their companies, and even for the financial market as a whole. So what’s wrong with the old approach? Traditional coaching tends to fuel leaders’ egos with praise, rather than challenging them with honest feedback. And instead of focusing on accountability and the bigger picture, traditional coaches just help the client fulfill their personal goals, and stand back when they see their client breaking their own values. Challenging Coaching believes this has to change. In the following blinks, you’ll find out:   how traditional coaching works,    what its original inspirations were,    how those roots are holding it back, and    what a better alternative looks like: the FACTS approach, which moves away from myth-based coaching to a model that actually works.   Even though it might seem to have existed forever, the coaching profession is actually still in its teenage years. When it first emerged in the 1980s, it was still very much a toddler, and easily influenced by its older peers – like psychotherapy and counselling. This influence means that coaching shares a core foundation with support-oriented counselling disciplines where the client gets unconditional positive backing. For example, active listening and powerful questioning are the two skill sets that are fundamentally required for counselling, mentoring, therapy – and coaching. These skills are considered necessary for developing an understanding of a client’s needs – which is the starting point of all progress – and helping them find their own answers, which is key to self-determination, a major value of support-oriented disciplines. But when coaching was born, it knew none of all this. So, in search of orientation, coaching took its biggest inspiration from person-centered therapy. Person-centered therapy was developed by Carl Rogers, one of the most influential therapists of the twentieth century, renowned for his humanist methodology. His non-directive approach is based on the fundamental belief that a client already possesses the vast resources necessary for development. The therapist's role is to help the client find their own solutions by creating a safe space for growth using empathy (seeing through another’s eyes), congruence (being completely open and honest) and unconditional, non-judgmental positive regard. These principles have become the foundation for traditional coaching models. For example, the popular Co-Active Coaching model significantly overlaps with Carl Rogers’ principles: the client is considered naturally resourceful, the agenda comes from the client, and the relationship is an alliance designed for the client’s growth. Another example is the well-known GROW model, which also shares its main assumptions with Rogers: The client is considered able to find their own solutions, empathy is focused to create a safe space, and understanding is developed through non-directive questioning. The newborn coaching profession was able to derive its methods and ethos from the theoretically established and practically proven foundations of psychotherapy and counselling. These predecessors have influenced coaching down to its core, and coaching literature widely agrees on three support-orientated principles that are emphasized as fundamentally important: \nThe nondirective approach. This principle assumes that the client – and not the coach – is the expert of their own situation: the client has the answers to her own problems, and the coach merely helps uncover them. The coach’s role is therefore to ask questions, listen, reflect, offer support and empower the client rather than problem-solve for them and give advice. \nRespecting the client’s agenda. This principle states that the coach must resist directing the client's agenda – even if they think that doing so would help. Fundamentally, it is always the client who decides which topics and areas are to be worked on – not the coach. \nBuilding rapport. Traditional coaches believe that effective progress can only happen on a foundation of strong empathy between the coach and client. The building of such a bond is assumed to lead to the fundamental trust and rapport necessary to create a safe space to grow. But while psychotherapy has gone through many paradigm shifts since its creation, and has constantly updated its core principles, coaching still holds on to its founding principles. Are these still up to date? Or is it time for change? Read on to find out. We’ve now learned about the origins of traditional coaching. But what if its fundamental principles are flawed to their very core? What if these principles need to be challenged? FACTS coaching believes that traditional coaching’s core principles hinder progress. To begin with, the nondirective approach is a myth: even with limited interactions, a coach inevitably influences the client. And if a client is stuck, the nondirective approach will leave them there far longer than necessary. By abandoning the nondirective approach, the coach could use their expertise to make suggestions that could stimulate new solutions. Then there are the limiting effects of sticking to the client’s agenda. For example, clients sometimes avoid difficult issues that must be tackled to overcome other problems. By moving beyond the client’s agenda, a coach is empowered to challenge those issues head on. Finally, even if building rapport is key to the coaching relationship, it should not get in the way of clients reaching their full potential. Rapport is fundamental for helping the often sensitive and dysfunctional clients who require psychotherapy and counselling. Coaching, however, often deals with robust people who can be pushed to their limits. This is why coaches must be allowed to take clients out their comfort zones to break through growth barriers. By limiting itself to these principles, traditional coaching can lead to the drastic consequences of collusion, irrelevance and self-obsession. An overly supportive, non-judgemental coach colludes with the client. This coach aligns with the client’s world view and fails to offer feedback from a different perspective – even when the client has got things wrong. And if coaches always hold on to the client’s agenda, this can lead to irrelevant work. Coaching sessions become time-killers instead of a push for the right outcome for the company as a whole. When these two approaches are combined, clients learn to focus solely on their own situation, and can become self-obsessive. When leaders focus too narrowly on their own agenda, this often leads to negative consequences for the wider organization – as we’ll see in a later blink. Have you ever had a teacher who became a good friend? Who filled your lessons with laughter and joy? That’s great – but for the sake of your progress, it might have been better if you had felt challenged rather than entertained, and had seriously tackled your weaknesses instead of focusing on fun. The same logic can be applied for coaching. FACTS-based coaching aims to find the right balance of challenge and support, in contrast to traditional coaching, which focuses too much on support. This lack of challenge leads to limited action, because taking risks could mean disrupting the cosy coach–client bond. So what can be done? The key to growth is to provide ambitious challenges with equally high levels of support. Not challenging the client will only lead to small results, as there are no big goals to reach, and just giving clients huge challenges without support will only lead to stress and failure. Growth happens when the coach sets goals that challenge the client and supports her in reaching them. One way FACTS-based coaches challenge their clients is by leaving the comfort zone of traditional coaching for areas of new growth. Coaching conversations usually take place in a “zone of comfortable debate,” because beyond that, things feel tense and harder to control. But to tackle issues at their heart, it’s necessary to enter the ZOUD: the “Zone of Uncomfortable Debate.” Being able to enter and sustain the ZOUD without damaging the coach–client relationship is a key component of FACTS-based coaching. To do so the coach must be challenging yet respectful, empathetic yet growth orientated. Now that we’ve explored what’s wrong with traditional coaching, let’s explore the core concepts of the FACTS approach. There are three main reasons why traditional coaches don’t provide honest feedback: 1. Feedback might have been experienced as judgmental. We’ve all felt angry when someone has criticized us, which can make us reluctant to make suggestions of our own. 2. The coach is not confident in his or her feedback skills. Not all coaching training courses include feedback training, which leaves a lot of coaches lacking a core skill. 3. Finally, the coach does not feel they have the client’s permission to give feedback. But not giving challenging, honest feedback is a risk – because feedback is quintessential for the client’s progress. Why? Firstly, feedback can uncover “blind spots.” Another person’s perspective is sometimes the fastest way of bringing an issue to light, even if it’s something simple: that piece of broccoli between your teeth is something you can easily solve, but only if you know about it! Feedback can also uncover so called “no go” areas. These are issues that clients are sometimes aware of, but prefer to ignore. Having somebody to keep you on track can jolt these issues back into the forefront of your mind, and help you tackle them head on. Finally, feedback is a powerful tool for preventing bad decisions. Confident business leaders are often surrounded by employees who are afraid of giving them negative feedback. Coaches can then play the role of delivering the honest, bad news. So how can a coach overcome their initial fear of feedback? 1. By ensuring that feedback is non-judgemental: by critiquing the client’s behavior instead of their personality, coaches can increase the receptivity of their feedback. 2. There are also well-established process models for providing feedback that coaches can learn. One example is the four stage approach: Observe the facts, judge their impact, invite the client to a conversation about your observations and assumptions, and agree on future action. 3. Finally, just ask if you may! If your client is not open to feedback, it’s better to find out sooner rather than later. During the oil spill crisis in Louisiana, BP’s CEO Tony Hayward found himself at the eye of a political storm. Giving his testimony before the US Congress, he distanced himself from the company’s mistakes and struggled to recall any of the events he was asked about. His behavior provoked fury among not only the direct victims of the oil spill, but also the public at large. This kind of behavior has led society to demand greater transparency and accountability on a governmental and economic level. Political parties and major public debates have even formed based on these issues – for example, the Pirate Party and Snowden’s NSA revelations both revolve around this topic. One key element of these new public demands has been the accountability of business leaders. But what business leaders often lack is somebody to actually hold them accountable. This is where coaches come into play. Coaches must move beyond traditional models where clients hold themselves responsible to a new model of holding their clients responsible on a personal and corporate level. For example, specific commitments must be agreed upon in contracts. If major decisions at BP had been committed in writing to their respective decision makers, the chain-of-command wouldn’t have been as unclear as it was revealed to be when the crisis struck. And maybe the decisions would have been made differently in the first place if somebody’s name was attached to them. But beyond this, coaches need to hold their clients accountable to the larger commitments their organization has made – for example, their organization’s mission statement, corporate values and social responsibility agenda. In May 1961, US President John F. Kennedy stood before Congress and proclaimed that the United States “should commit itself to achieving the goal, before the decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth.” But a traditional coach would never have agreed with Kennedy on setting this goal. Why? Because traditional goal-setting processes inhibit great outcomes. Traditional goal setting uses popular guidelines like SMART (Specific, Measurable, Agreed, Realistic, Timed) and PRISM (Personal, Realistic, Interesting, Specific, Measurable), which focus on rational, realistic goals. While this focus does lead to reliable outcomes within a predetermined range, its aversion to risk inhibits transformation on a bigger scale: aiming only for \"realistic\" goals prevents the leap of faith necessary for huge innovations – like taking man to the moon. The truth is that setting courageous goals leads to real transformation – which is not only desirable, but necessary. Why? Because in a global and fast-changing economy, businesses need to be more flexible than ever before. And to successfully transform their organizations, clients need the creativity and courage to tackle the unknown – resources which can only be unleashed by setting bold goals. Traditional goals might be to “increase sales by ten percent in the next quarter,” but that’s not enough to satisfy today’s big players. The late Steve Jobs is famous for wanting to “put a ding in the Universe” at Apple; Facebook set out to connect the whole world; and Amazon is trying to sell everything to everyone. These companies aren’t simply naive: they are courageous. Alexander Karelin felt pretty relaxed. At the 2000 Olympic Games he was the three-time defending champion of Greco-Roman wrestling, and had never lost a single match in his 15 years of international competition. His opponent in the finals, Rulon Gardner, had never finished higher than fifth in any international wrestling competition, and was arguably perceived as the easiest opponent Karelin had ever to face in a final match. But although Alexander Karelin had won 887 wrestling matches, he lost this one. There was no cheating, no injury, no bad luck – nothing out of the ordinary. So why did he lose? Some thought he was too nervous. But after more than 80 victories and three Olympic finals with more threatening opponents, this is highly unlikely. In fact, the opposite might be true: he was probably not nervous enough. This agrees with the FACTS perspective that tension is necessary for optimal performance. Traditional coaching’s techniques and values, having emerged from the supportive counselling disciplines, focus on reducing stress and tension. The traditional coaching approach to Karelin’s final match would have been to worry about the potential pressure he was feeling, and do their best to dissipate it. But countless psychological findings confirm that everybody has an optimal level in between anxiety and comfort where they enter a state of flow and peak performance. Every athlete can confirm that a certain level of adrenalin is needed to bring their best performance to the table. And what triggers the production of adrenalin? FACTS coaching aims to maintain this optimal level of tension by pushing the client to their limits. And because high-achieving people often operate optimally in higher levels of tension than coachs, the tension has to be calibrated to the client, and not to the coach. The most successful professional athletes and their coaches often state “keeping the tension” as their major challenge for sustaining excellence. And if you don’t aim high enough, this tension is lost in advance. We’ve all heard of the bank employees who took down the whole bank. Nick Leeson is one of them. A former broker at Barings Bank, the United Kingdom's oldest investment bank, he earned Barings £10,000,000 in his first year as general manager of future markets, which translated into a £130,000 bonus for himself. Motivated by his bonuses, Leeson started investing in increasingly risky trades – which led to the demise of the entire bank. By the end of 1995, his investments totalled a loss of £827,000,000, and Barings had to declare bankruptcy. What went wrong? Leeson narrowly focused on his individual goals, which led to a lack of system awareness. Clients are particularly prone to focusing chiefly on their own performance – because coaches traditionally encourage them to do so. Leeson’s only motivation was to push his personal outcomes, thinking that this is what was expected of him. What he didn’t realize is that the risks he was taking were threatening not only his own fate, but that of the whole system. What could have saved Leeson and Barings? A FACTS-trained coach. It’s a FACTS coach’s job to raise a client’s awareness of the system as a whole. This should be done by repeatedly asking questions that question the wider implications of the clients actions – without offering an opinion and avoiding to take the moral high ground. The goal is intelligent growth – not moralizing. Nick Leeson was eventually captured and sentenced to six and a half years in prison. His actions remain a warning of how single individuals can ruin whole organizations. Keeping this in the big players’ minds without inhibiting their potential is a sensitive task – but FACTS coaching offers the tools for the challenge. The key message in this book: Traditional coaching’s therapeutic origins prevent it from yielding optimal results.

What would you see? Horse-drawn coaches; no telephones; perhaps even hunter-gatherers looking for a square meal for the tribe. Our lives today are, of course, different. Innovations in technology and agriculture have made living in the modern world simpler and easier. One would think, therefore, that innovation equals progress. But is this true? These blinks show us that, although innovation is powerful, it hasn’t exactly made our lives better. What is needed to invent truly innovative products or services that make our lives truly better is a whole different type of thinking, called design thinking.  In these blinks, you’ll discover how being “thoughtless” could lead to thoughtful innovation; why thinking with your hands beats thinking with your head; and how sharing stories can get people to be more charitable. Many people understand innovation to be simply the process of inventing a new technology. When you have your new invention, then you have an “innovation.“ This view is far too simplistic. In contrast, design thinking offers you a method to approach the process of innovation, and thus achieve a more sophisticated understanding of innovation itself. Design thinking encourages us to take an integrative approach to innovation. This approach combines three overlapping “spaces,” through which a project may cycle several times. First comes inspiration. In this space, we consider a problem or opportunity, thinking about what we can do to solve the problem or bring the opportunity to fruition. Second is ideation. Here we develop our ideas and theories, and then put them to the test. Last is implementation. In this space, we introduce our idea to the market. You won’t march directly through these three spaces – rather, most innovations will pass through each space a number of times as part of the design thinking process. For example, during the process of ideation, you could develop a product with features that go beyond addressing your initial problem. In this case, you might want to revisit the inspiration process, to consider what different kinds of problems your product’s new feature could solve. To create an integrated solution, a design thinker must balance three aspects: feasibility, viability and desirability. Whereas a “normal” designer may resolve the different aspects of a project separately and one by one, a design thinker brings them all together as one harmonious solution. The gaming console Nintendo Wii offers an example of an integrated solution that perfectly balances feasibility, viability and desirability. Nintendo introduced gestural control to console gaming, which at the time was not only feasible (if not cutting-edge) but viable. The company also priced the console less than other machines on the market, while providing a more immersive experience for the player – thus making the Wii desirable for their target market. In the course of your design projects, you too should make this integrative approach the foundation of your design thinking. According to economist Peter Drucker, a designer’s job is to convert need into demand. Simple enough, yet how exactly does a designer go about doing this? Design thinking supposes that the best insights come from observation, or taking a closer look at how people live their daily lives. Psychologist Jane Fulton Suri says that we are so good at adapting our behaviors to inconvenient situations that we’re often not aware of the “thoughtless acts” that could trigger inspiration for the observant designer. Imagine an office worker trying to sort out the tangled chaos of cables under his desk by sticking a label to each one. He likely wouldn’t have come up with this solution had he been asked directly how to solve this particular problem. This is why observing people’s real-life behavior is so important. Observing provides meaningful insights into pressing needs. Yet design thinking goes beyond mere observation, in that it also invites people to engage in creating solutions to their own problems. Psychologist Abraham Maslow suggests that once a person’s basic needs are met, he will look instead for meaningful or emotionally satisfying experiences. From a design perspective, a great customer experience is one that fulfills these higher-order needs. But since every person has different needs and aspirations, design thinking proposes that we let people participate in creating their own customer experience to make it personally meaningful and engaging to them. Whole Foods Market, for example, is one of the most successful retailers in the United States, as the store provides an enriching shopping experience by offering free samples of products and a wide variety of healthy products that cater to customers’ lifestyles. At a Whole Foods Market location in Austin, Texas, the company is even experimenting with letting customers cook inside the store! This sort of hands-on approach allows customers to engage and thus gives them the opportunity to create their own meaningful experience. Many of us played with LEGOs as children, building our own dreamworlds brick by colorful brick. As adults, however, we do most of our inventing in our heads long before we employ our hands to realize our ideas concretely. Yet thinking with our hands, or prototyping, is a powerful strategy for design thinkers as it can generate better results faster. By actually building an idea (with materials, rather than with only our minds), we quickly learn its limitations and see the many possible directions we can take it. Thus prototyping shouldn’t come at the end of the process but at the beginning! The earlier you start prototyping, the more rudimentary your prototypes will be. But consider that a ball from a roll-on deodorant and a plastic butter dish was all it took to prototype Apple’s first mouse! Once you have a prototype, you should put it out in the real world and observe how people use it. This way, you can quickly discern whether it “works” or how people actually would use it. When T-Mobile started social groups via mobile phones, for example, the company launched two prototypes simultaneously and observed how users interacted with each. Thus the company was able to get a deeper understanding of which solutions customers found more compelling. The reason prototyping is so powerful is because it occupies all three spaces of innovation at once. It is always inspirational, in that using and observing a prototype gives birth to new ideas and potential improvements. Playing with a prototype is a way to test and develop your idea. In other words, it fits solidly in the ideation space. And prototyping demonstrates the viability of an idea, showing that it can actually work and that it belongs in the marketplace, discoveries that live in the implementation space. Our love of storytelling starts at an early age, and stories are at least partly responsible for how we understand ideas and concepts. Thus it should be no surprise that storytelling too plays an important role in design thinking. Design thinkers use stories to make a product more relatable to customers. To develop a good story, a design thinker must consider how a product came into being and how a customer will use it over time. Importantly, the storyline must involve the customer at every step, reaching as far back as the very beginning of the product’s life. For outdoor wear company Icebreaker, this meant attaching a code to each of its garments, with which a customer could track, for example, the wool in a jacket to its source in New Zealand, even to the exact farm where the Merino sheep are cared for. The ways in which a customer uses a product over its lifespan should also be considered when developing a story. To sell a project that was essentially a predecessor of a modern GPS system, IDEO designers told a story about a sailor navigating from one port to the next. Each “chapter” in the story described another important problem the sailor encountered along his journey, and each solution was a feature that was to be developed for the system. But the most meaningful stories are those which customers can write themselves. By engaging customers as active participants in a product’s story, they will be more inclined to use the product or service. The American Red Cross used this to its advantage when it invited people to share stories and motivations for donating blood – a mother’s life was saved thanks to a blood transfusion, for example – thus reinforcing the goal of getting donors to return. These stories remind donors of the good that they do, and motivate new donors to contribute as well to this \"common commitment.\" Google has pink flamingos and inflatable dinosaurs. Pixar has beach huts. Start-ups all over the world have “chill-out” lounges and ping-pong tables. Such perks are the marks of creative company cultures. However, you don’t necessarily need a beach hut or a comfy sofa to create an environment that fosters innovation. Innovation happens when an organization supports experimentation and accepts failure as a part of life. When people are afraid to try new things, no breakthroughs will happen. People won’t dare to develop or test ideas for fear of the consequences of failure. New ideas require an environment where failure – and thus learning – is an acceptable step on the road to innovation. Innovation too requires the right kind of team. Specifically, collaboration in diverse, interdisciplinary smart teams helps to unlock an organization's creative powers. Any project requires input from as many people as possible, including designers, engineers, marketing managers and so on. Bringing all these people together at the beginning as part of your smart team allows you to capitalize on interdisciplinary thinking. Indeed, designers will offer different ideas, perspectives and insights than accountants or software engineers will, but their ideas are no less viable or relevant. It’s important to incorporate these ideas as soon as possible for the sake of expedience. Smart teams will need space to work, and companies should provide a designated space for doing so. The internet as well offers tons of possibilities for teams to work together and innovate. One such online platform is Innocentive, where any research & development team can post a challenge, to which thousands of scientists, designers and engineers can contribute solutions. In a physical office, however, companies should simply designate a physical space in which people from different departments can come together – away from their own private desks – to get the creative juices flowing. Much to the chagrin of parents, children always ask, “Why?” even about the simplest things. Discovering and trying to understand the world from their own developing perspective, children are always looking for insight that will help make sense of what they’re seeing and experiencing. Similarly, a good design thinker always asks, “Why?” Such questioning allows us the opportunity to reframe a problem, understand its constraints and use the information to find a more innovative solution. Instead of accepting the world “as it is” because “it has always been thus,” we should ask whether a current solution to a problem is the optimal one, or indeed whether we’re even addressing the right problem in the first place. Before organized agriculture, humans gathered fruits and vegetables from near and far. This exhausting, sometimes fruitless task was simply the way things were done for thousands of years. Eventually somebody asked: Why do we spend so much time wandering around for food when we know that plants grow from and also produce seeds? By asking this simple question and using it as a springboard for innovation, agriculture, and thus civilization, were born. But good design thinkers aren’t satisfied with just having discovered a solution to a problem. Rather, they want to share their ideas in the hopes that the ideas will be built upon by other innovators. It’s easy to get possessive about ideas. After all, we’ve put so much time and energy into them that we start to see them as parts of ourselves. Thus we try to monopolize the development of our ideas and bar others from tinkering with them. But this is terrible for innovation! If an idea is shared freely, it will quickly improve – and that’s a situation in which everybody wins. As the evidence for human-made global climate change continues to mount, companies and designers need to consider what they can do to help preserve a livable climate for all. Design thinking has the potential to increase public awareness and inspire everyone to engage in a more sustainable lifestyle by effectively informing people about environmental issues. This is not because people are intrinsically interested in environmental sustainability, however. Rather, companies need to find ways to inspire sustainable habits based on behaviors that people already exhibit or that are easily introduced. For example, after design thinkers realized that shoppers valued style and comfort over basic energy efficiency when it came to purchasing products, the U.S. Department of Energy decided to shift its focus when promoting products to encourage Americans to adopt a more sustainable lifestyle. Thus designers explored the creation of stylish yet nonetheless energy-efficient products and catchy informational tools to better attract consumers’ attention when shopping. Design thinkers also understand that to communicate the urgency of climate change, facts alone are not enough. Thus, designers need to start thinking about how to make sustainability more accessible. One practical way for design thinkers to find a solution is to use a deck of cards, called “Drivers of Change.” The deck is composed of cards with answers to questions like, “Can we afford a low-carbon future?” The cards get a message across with simple facts and images. In fact, the deck has been used by discussion groups to inspire developments in sustainability initiatives. Design thinkers should look at the entire production process, examining products from the extraction of raw materials to disposal. In doing so, it’s hard not to find opportunities for environmentally friendly innovation! A good example of this kind of design thinking is Pangea Organics, a company that produces natural body-care products. Its products employ compostable packaging that contains wildflower seeds; thus you can soak the packaging with water and toss it in your backyard, where it would grow! The key message in this book: Producing the kinds of innovations that change the world requires starting with the right design philosophy – one that emphasizes fluidity, brings people together and keeps its focus on the real-word applications and implications of an idea. Actionable advice: Make it a rule to ask “Why?” once a day.   By being intentional about second-guessing everything, from “Why is the sky blue?” to the foundational beliefs that inform your life’s perspective, you can learn to become more flexible in your problem solving and might even find some inspiration for products and services along the way.

Just by stating, “We want a higher profit margin,” they think that employees will jump to action and align their work with this broad and poorly conceived goal. It just doesn’t work that way! These blinks show you that to change a culture, you have to integrate that change from the very top of your organization to the very bottom. And focusing on results and goals is just one small part of the puzzle. You have to consider all the elements on the table – company experience, employee beliefs and ingrained practices – and then ensure that what you change is actually sustained. Yet in doing so, you’ll find that your organization will hum along like a well-oiled machine, and processes that were previously bogged down now run with precision and ease. In the following blinks, you’ll discover how General Motors overhauled its corporate culture and stemmed massive losses; why changing a culture is a transition and not a transformation; and why one bookstore lets employees give tokens to each other. Managers shape a company’s culture every day in the experiences they create for employees. Employees in turn learn how things are done, and an organizational culture establishes itself. Yet not all organizational cultures are healthy. In some cases, they can even do more damage than good. This is why leaders need to focus on creating a culture that is beneficial for the company as a whole, from the lowest levels all the way to the top. But how is this done? The first step is to define your goals and a strategy to reach them. For example, “Make decisions. Take risks. Move fast. Be accountable,” was the strategy General Motors put forward in 2009 to change its culture and stop the company from losing money once and for all. How did GM decide on this route? To shape your culture and help your organization win, you have to understand the results pyramid. There are three key components that make up the results pyramid: experiences, beliefs and actions. Stacked on top of each other, the components all contribute to the end result, or the achievements of your organization. In short: experiences promote beliefs, beliefs impact actions and actions generate results. Alaris Medical Systems had a bad rep on Wall Street and was criticized for its inability to execute on otherwise quite good ideas. This was the case, that is, until the company turned to the results pyramid as a guide to change its culture. Alaris executives discussed with every manager how to create the right experiences to foster the desired beliefs, which would in turn produce effective actions, and ultimately achieve the company’s desired target results. Once the program was introduced, every employee at every level was motivated, optimistic and determined to get results and execute. Within six months, Alaris had completely turned their reputation around! So what kind of culture exactly should you be thinking about implementing within your organization? The key is in the last line of General Motor’s reformed strategy: “Be accountable.” Accountability is vital to a strong organizational culture, and it is shaped by every action an employee performs. In organizations, a thin line separates great companies from poor ones. In general, there are two modes of acting: above the line and below the line. Only one promotes accountability. By acting above the line, we can move toward accountability in four simple steps. First, we have to see it, by considering other people’s viewpoints, communicating honestly and candidly, exchanging feedback and hearing the difficult truths that expose the real circumstances at hand. Second, we need to own it by accepting the goals and priorities of the organization’s mission as one’s own. Only then are we able to solve it, by asking what else we could do to get the results we want. Finally, we’ve got to do it, and perform the tasks we said we would, focus on our priorities and be reliable and trustworthy.   When everyone in an organization decides of their own free will to take above the line steps, you’ll have a culture of accountability. While your company should strive for above the line actions, below the line actions will only harm your organizational culture. When we act below the line, we refuse to accept responsibility and instead become obsessed with blame games, cycles of finger pointing and employees playing the victim. Of course, acting below the line is also human. But by remaining below the line, you’ll tread in dangerous waters regarding accountability. Accountability shouldn’t make the question, “Who’s accountable for this?” sound like a punishment. It should instead be empowering. Accountability isn’t about “getting caught” or failing, but should be approached as playing a starring role in reaching a solution. In a world where being first means everything, you can’t take your time implementing a culture change. But equally importantly, you can’t take shortcuts, either! Too often, leaders try to change the way people act to get the results they want without working to change the way people think or what they believe. So while employees might appear involved, they won’t actually be committed to the company’s cause. This means that only the top of the results pyramid is being addressed – actions and results – while the pyramid’s two fundamental elements – experiences and beliefs – are being neglected.   To better understand why this doesn’t work, let’s call R1 your current results, as produced by the current culture, C1. Then let’s call R2 the desired results that you’ll get with C2, the new culture. It’s impossible to get results with your current culture, C1. So to create C2, you have to create new experiences, E2, and new beliefs, B2. Only these can effectively shape new actions, A2, to generate improved results, R2, as your new culture, C2, emerges.    Creating a shift in experiences and beliefs takes more effort. But it will yield substantial, long-lasting changes that will then create a firm foundation for the results you want. This process occurs on different scales and at different speeds for different companies. Think of assuming a new approach to your organization’s culture as a transition and not as a transformation. An optical retailer wanted to test a new organizational culture, and so the company ran a pilot in a few retail stores. After two months, business improved more than 5 percent. The change in culture had led to the desired R2; results, as employees were thinking and acting differently with regard to daily work. Soon thereafter, the retailer took the change company-wide. How can you get everyone in your organization to rally around those key R2 results? Simply: alignment. Think of alignment as the guiding beliefs and deliberate actions that an organization applies to a clear and common goal. When people are all on the same page, following the same goals, there’s less stress, decision making is faster and more efficient, and other processes across the organization also speed up. In this way, alignment is vital for effective cultural change. Still not clear on why this is the case? Think about what happens when you have confusion about your goals. This can kill the momentum in your push for change. Why? Because nobody’s aligned. They don’t know where to push, or in which direction to go. For instance, fast-food chain Fast Grill wanted to improve its profit margins so the company could expand. During a meeting, the author asked Fast Grill’s top management what key results the company was aiming for. They all replied “profit margins.” Seems aligned, right? But when the author followed up and asked what the exact margin goal was, everyone in management gave different answers! Fast Grill management’s confusion led to poor execution, below the line behavior, and thus slow change. To avoid this situation, ensure that everyone’s on the same page and totally aligned! Remember: alignment is a process, not an event. It is something you must constantly work to achieve. If you want to guide a culture change in your organization, there are certain skills you’ll need as a leader. Having such skills are key to accelerating the process and enhancing your overall leadership. So what are these skills? The first thing you’ll need to take your organization from C1 to C2 is the skill to lead the change. In other words, you can’t just assign the responsibility to another department. As a leader, it’s up to you to keep abreast with everything going on as part of the change at every level. When you’re leading a change on such a major scale, you’ll no doubt receive criticism. To deal with this, you’ll need the skill to respond back. There are five steps you should take in response to feedback, to ensure everyone is aligned toward C2. First, you must identify the beliefs you want others to share. Second, you need to communicate this belief; and third, you should portray the experience you’re going to deliver to your employees. Fourth, you need to ask for feedback on the planned experience, and finally, enroll employees in providing feedback as the plan progresses. The final necessary skill to lead a change is the skill to be facilitative. You want meaningful dialogue about the culture change in your organization? Then you’ve got to encourage dialogue, teamwork and collaboration. Sony VAIO wanted to improve repair-related customer satisfaction scores by 15 percent over the previous year. Steven Nickel, VAIO Service vice president, energized the organization around R2 by opening the door to an ongoing dialogue. Many team members who had never spoken up in meetings before enthusiastically shared numerous improvement ideas, and VAIO Service ultimately exceeded its goal. Making all these plans and implementing a change means nothing if you can’t sustain it! There are three simple steps to ensure you integrate C² practices into the everyday life of your organization. First, list all the meetings, policies and procedures that the organization has. Second, find where you can integrate a culture change into your organizational systems. And finally, apply the changes into the activities you’ve selected. Eastside Health Plans offers an example of this three-step process. After the Eastside management team evaluated the first two steps in the integration process, they arrived at a plan. The team took early steps to align their organizational systems as well, from administration to meetings to human resources. For the first time in 25 years, leaders began to create significant experiences that suggested the company would not tolerate waste. Teams were formed to address waste as well as inefficiencies and administrative costs within the organization. These teams ultimately achieved line-item cost savings of over $200 million! If you can integrate a culture change effectively, your employees won’t see it as just another annoying management program. Instead, it will become an enjoyable part of life at work. For example, one of the author’s daughters took a job at a local bookstore and shared with him how much she enjoyed the culture at her new job. When asked what she enjoyed the most, she explained that whenever an employee saw another employee doing a good job, they could give that employee a token, to earn free products from the store. In fact, the store was one of the father’s clients, and one that had integrated a culture of accountability into their organization so successfully that the culture became a positive aspect of an employee’s day! The key message in this book: Take your organization to its full potential by implementing a culture change and fostering accountability across all levels. By considering relationships between experiences, beliefs, actions and results, steps can be taken toward building and then sustaining a new organizational culture. Actionable advice: Take it step by step! To help ensure accurate alignment around key decisions with everyone in an organization, the leadership alignment process is a useful guide. Step one is participation, where you get the appropriate people involved. Step two is accountability, where you identify those who will make decisions. Step three is discussion, in which you make sure that people are able to speak up and are heard. Step four is ownership, where you promote the decision as your own. Step five involves communication, to ensure that your message is consistent. And finally, step 6 is follow-up, where you check in with your organization and test for appropriate alignment across all areas. Suggested further reading: How to Be a Positive Leader by Jane E.

When the author, Richard Sheridan, was a manager at a software company, Interface Systems, he dreaded work so much he changed his route to the office. Turning off the highway, he’d drive backroads and head into the countryside before reluctantly arriving at work. He soon realized there simply had to be a better approach to work and leadership. Sheridan came to dream of leading an organization in which people could find real joy. At Menlo Innovations, the software firm that the author founded in Ann Arbor, Michigan, he’s achieved his dream. These blinks recount how he leads his business with a focus on joy and optimism. Sheridan describes how it’s possible to cultivate leadership that ignores fear, hierarchy and bureaucracy, and cares instead about creativity and personal authenticity. In these blinks, you’ll understand how, with the right values, approaches and systems, it’s possible for anyone to do the same. In these blinks, you’ll learn what the author’s ten-year-old self taught him about business; why humility is a key leadership quality; and why interview candidates should be encouraged to care for one another. Do you show your authentic self in the workplace? Or are office-you and home-you different people? Too many people feel unable to be their authentic selves in the workplace. A local non-profit organization called Ele’s Place once visited Menlo, the author’s company, to share its story. Ele’s Place helps young people process grief after the loss of a family member. One of the exercises they run uses a white plastic mask, the kind you might see at a costume party. The teenagers are encouraged to write, on the outside of the mask, what emotions they shared with the world. Things like ‘I’m feeling better,’ or, ‘I’m hanging in there.’ But on the inside of the masks, the children would write how they really felt with sentences like ‘when will the hurt stop?’ or simply, ‘scared.’ When they shared their masks, they realized – often for the first time – that other people experienced the same feelings. The exercise allowed them to be authentic in a safe environment, and therefore to process their overwhelming emotions. Sharing our true emotional state – the inside of our masks – in the workplace is hard, particularly for leaders who feel they should – like the hurting teenagers – put on a brave face and hide their vulnerabilities. Read the outside of a leader’s mask, and it might say words like ‘confident,’ ‘ambitious’ or ‘strong.’ But inside? Words like ‘stressed,’ ‘anxious’ and ‘overwhelmed’ might show up. And just like with the teenagers, perhaps they might take comfort in sharing their masks with their colleagues and fellow leaders. It may be counterintuitive to embrace the vulnerabilities that come with true authenticity. The next important leadership value, humility, may also appear to go against good business practice. If your business is humble, won’t your more confident competitors trample all over you? Well, for the author, humility is all about considering others and acknowledging that all work in a business is noble. That’s why the author often cleans up after client lunches. It’s why every morning, he empties the office dishwasher. If keeping things tidy is a behavior he wants to instill in his organization, he should be willing to follow through on that himself. As a result, he has a happy team, content in the knowledge that he’s humble enough to do anything that he might ask of them. What color hat do you wear? The psychologist and philosopher Edward de Bono wrote a book, first published in 1985, called Six Thinking Hats, in which he set out six different approaches to thinking through any situation. The white hat-wearing thinker, for example, sees any situation solely through a prism of cold hard facts. Someone wearing a red hat, by contrast, would consider only the emotion of the moment. The black hat is often regarded as the engineering mindset, considering all that could go wrong, how and why. We need this kind of thinking. Without it, buildings in earthquake zones would topple. But leaders can’t afford to get bogged down with this thinking alone. They need to put their yellow hats on, too. The yellow hat is an optimistic outlook that is oriented toward success, considering from the start that success is a strong possibility. When an organization has plenty of people looking at things from the perspective of a white, red or black hat, sometimes it needs its leader to be wearing a yellow hat, so that they can provide optimism and engagement. In practical terms, that can involve just saying, “That seems like a great idea. Let’s do it.” Leaders from all over the world, from brands like GM, GE, Coca-Cola and McKinsey have visited the author’s company to learn how it built such a joyful culture, with minimal hierarchy and a highly engaged team. They’re usually inspired and ask what they could do as a leader that would make a difference. The author always says “abandon your office and move onto the floor with your people.” This advice is often met with nervous laughter, and the advice is rarely followed. But one visitor, Ron Sail, then-leader of GE Global Services in New York, did just that. He gave up his own office, tore down the rest of the walls dividing his team, and embraced face-to-face conversations and team spirit. The result? His team loved him. Others at GE now want to emulate his way of working. GE even named a training center after him. By tearing down walls, Ron had embraced the optimism and joy that said, “why not just try it?” So embrace optimism. If you have an idea for something that might make your organization more joyful, don’t get stuck in black-hat thinking and examine every way it might go wrong. Just do it. In 1968, the author’s mom ordered a new bookshelf. At that time, getting new furniture was a big deal, and his mom was excited. The author decided he would surprise his parents while they were out. So, at just ten years old, he carefully assembled the bookcase himself, arranged some books, hooked up their stereo and had his mom’s favorite record playing when they walked in. His dad looked on, speechless, and his mom actually cried. It was a joyful moment to see their reactions. This moment taught him a lesson that has influenced his business career – that true joy comes not from creating things for ourselves, but from serving others. So, try to build a culture focused on serving people. There’s an old story about three bricklayers, which shows how this instills joy. A passerby asked the three men what they were doing. The first replied that he was laying bricks. The second one said that he was building a wall. The third? With a wide, proud smile, he said that he was creating a cathedral. The third man was joyful because he felt that his work was serving others. This goes to show it’s possible to focus on serving others, whatever your business or your role. That’s even the case if you’re doing something as simple as cleaning tables. The author used to indulge in a McDonald’s meal when he would fly out of the Detroit airport. He always noticed an older McDonald’s worker, Mike. His job was to clean away trash and wipe tables – mundane but important tasks he did with great care. But he didn’t just keep things clean. He served. If he saw that you didn’t have a napkin, he’d offer to get you one. Then he’d make small talk, and wish you a pleasant flight – small touches, perhaps, but a remarkable attitude nonetheless. Once, the author noticed that a younger man had taken Mike’s place. And, to the author’s surprise, this man also went out of his way to offer assistance and a kind word. When the author tracked down the branch manager, the manager said that it was no coincidence. He felt a little kindness and care went a long way in a competitive retail environment, so he’d established a culture built around service. The branch manager wasn’t just a manager. By building an effective culture, he showed that he was a leader. Let’s take a look at that crucial difference in more detail. What’s the difference between a leader and a boss? Well, a boss tells you what to do using the authority of their position. A leader influences and motivates. A boss demands adherence, whereas a leader cultivates thinking, teamwork and a lets-get-things-done-together attitude. While a boss tends to be at the top of a hierarchy, leaders can be found at every level. There are plenty of reasons why an organization that cultivates leaders, rather than bosses, will be more effective. One is that an organization with a leadership culture will be more likely to experiment. In a boss-oriented workplace, if you want to try something new and exciting, you have to get the boss’ permission. That’s problematic, because if permission is regularly sought but denied, then at some point people will stop seeking it, and innovations will die before they’re proposed. But in a leadership-oriented organization, there’s little requirement for formal permission, and no blame culture when ideas are tried but go wrong. In the author’s previous role at Interface Systems, he hung a poster on the wall that said “Make Mistakes Faster.” At first, still thinking like a boss, he wasn’t entirely comfortable with it. He didn’t really want more, faster mistakes – he wanted the opposite. But eventually, he came to realize that trying to avoid small mistakes was actually slowing things down and contributing to large, costly errors. In a leader-oriented culture, mistakes are expected and dealt with by teams happy to roll up their sleeves and work together to correct them or learn from them. Prioritizing leaders over bosses means having a non-hierarchical culture. At Menlo Innovations, the whole team is empowered to make decisions, rather than deferring to and seeking permission from just one or two bosses. At Menlo, for example, interviews are conducted by the whole team, as are performance reviews and other key decisions. It’s such a radically non-hierarchical organization that when a guest asked Menlo team members who they reported to, they were stumped. One said, unsure, “I guess the customers?” Another ventured that they reported to the process itself. Then, almost in unison, they all pointed to each other. “We report to each other,” they said. Menlo is living proof that an organization without bosses can work. But to get it right, you need strong systems. When you think about what brings you joy, systems probably don’t immediately spring to mind. If you want to make your organization joyful, though, focusing on systems is actually a great step to take. Unfortunately, systems are often overlooked when businesses are faced with challenges like a failed sales pitch or a harsh customer complaint. These are often put down to chance or lack of work ethic. A good leader, however, will consider that it might be the result of a flawed system. System thinkers approach an organization in terms of its systems and processes. They consider the way work is allocated and monitored, or how certain tasks can be made simpler. Systems thinkers are always looking for ways to make things better. Take Menlo’s time tracking system, for example. Every week, everyone in the business submits a timesheet detailing the time they worked on each task, accurate to every fifteen minutes. This simple system enables them to make reliable predictions about the time needed for future projects. This reduces the need for excessive overtime, which in turn reduces bugs in software and the anxiety and low morale that come from being overworked. So, systems are important. But how do you design them in a way that brings joy? Well, one key factor is to create policies that reward the positive behaviors that you want to encourage. The author once advised Dominique Coster, an R&D team leader for an automotive supplier, on how to generate the kind of team collaboration that Menlo enjoys. Coster had taken the author’s advice, by opening up the office space to facilitate more spontaneous conversation. As a result, team collaboration improved. But after a few months, things had stalled. The author stumbled upon a solution when he asked Coster what they celebrated as a team. The answer was that each time a patent was issued, the individual who had been granted the patent received a plaque, often presented by senior management flown in from Tokyo. Bingo! The author pointed out that while Coster wanted to cultivate team thinking, he was celebrating individual achievement. Soon after, Coster’s team started rewarding the whole team behind the patents, from engineers to accountants. They changed their system, and behavior in the organization changed as a result. Do the people in your organization truly care about one another? If not, have you considered how much more joyful your workplace would be if they did? To build an ethos of caring for one another, consider the systems you have in place relating to your people. Recruitment would be a great place to start. Potential recruits at Menlo are given a clear message about the company's ethos from the beginning. In their first interview, candidates work in pairs to complete a joint task. They’re also given clear instructions – they might be competing, but they must help one another in order to get a second interview. If one partner is struggling, the other should help them out. If one seems nervous, the second should try to put them at ease. Employees learn from their very first encounter with Menlo that it’s an organization in which colleagues look out for one another’s interests rather than their own. They quickly learn to embrace the shared responsibility of supporting one another. For example, one Menlo employee was struggling with punctuality, and occasionally not making it to the office at all due to problems at home. In many businesses, the situation may have resulted in a firing. At Menlo, though, another colleague volunteered to pick the employee up every morning and bring him to the office. This gave the troubled employee the extra push he needed to make it to work, probably saving him his job. On other occasions, caring for others simply means thinking about each other as people, not just as employees. The author’s assistant, Anna, coordinates his life and helps arrange his busy schedule of international speaking engagements, as well as tours and visits to Menlo’s offices. In 2015, the author gave over 40 talks around the world. He enjoyed the work, but it was a bit too much for him. Before he even had to say anything, Anna told the author she was refusing any requests for December that would involve travel. Having some family time, she said, was more important for him. Caring is important. But so is sharing – specifically, sharing knowledge and experience. Your business may be under threat, and you don’t even know it. Borders Books was founded in 1971. Hugely successful, in its last year of operation it employed almost 20,000 people. Amazon was only founded in 1994, but by 2011 it had put Borders out of business. Borders had 17 years to learn how to survive in a new, internet-dominated world. But it couldn’t. If there’s one lesson to learn from this, it’s that leaders need to be active, continual learners. As Peter Senge, a systems scientist at MIT, says, the only long-term source of competitive advantage is a business’ ability to learn more quickly than its competition. So, how can you build a learning culture? First, try to establish strong reading habits within your team to generate excitement and imagination about new ideas. The author’s co-founder, James Goebel, sometimes comments that Menlo never invented anything. They stole every idea they ever had from a book. There are a couple of practical things you can do to build a reading culture. The first is simply to make books available. Create a free library. Don’t worry if books go missing. If a particular favorite is always unavailable, buy a second copy. You can then go one step further and start an in-house book club, or a “lunch and learn” session, where one team member shares insights from a book they’ve read. Not only is this a great way to spread new ideas, but it can also help build presentation skills. The second is to let your people teach each other. The most important thing that Menlo has done to enable a learning culture is pairing its people together. Almost all colleagues, from programmers to project managers, work in pairs. Programmers work with other programmers, and project managers work with other project managers. They sit together and work through each task. And because pairs change every week, colleagues are constantly learning. They learn from one another’s experiences, strengths and even weaknesses. When someone has an idea, they must lead their paired colleague toward it, thinking out loud, articulating their vision and answering questions. This makes continuous learning part of the process. And that doesn’t just make your business more resilient and prepared for the future. It creates a business in which people are constantly enjoying learning and teaching, exchanging views and expanding their horizons – a business that brings joy. The key message in these blinks: Too many people face their workday with a sense of dread. But it doesn’t have to be this way. If you’re a leader, there are some simple things you can do to build a culture that generates joy. You can abandon the old ways of doing things that rely on hierarchy, bureaucracy and fear, and embrace a model in which people have a sense of purpose, can take responsibility, learn from one another and constantly improve. You can create joy at work. Actionable advice: Give equal bonuses.  One of the most important things you can do to build a joyful culture is to give equal bonuses – not as a percentage of pay, but equal amounts. That tells everyone that each person contributes something valuable to the business, from the smartest engineer to the assistant who answers the phone so pleasantly when a potential client calls. Nobody quite knows what moments of magic or mundane coincidence lead to success, so focus on rewarding the accomplishments of the team. Got feedback?

Nalebuff and Adam M. Brandenburger","summary":"Particularly in business settings, the concepts of cooperation and competition tend to be viewed as opposite, mutually exclusive ideas. But this isn’t necessarily the case, and with a bit of creativity and a gentle merging of the two words, the concept of co-opetition emerges. While it may seem a fairly strange word, it’s actually a useful tool when setting up a business in today’s complex marketplace. If you’re involved in business, whether as a customer, supplier, entrepreneur or competitor, you need to know how the game of business works and, perhaps more importantly, how to shift the rules to your own business’s advantage. In Co-opetition, Barry J. Nalebuff and Adam M. Brandenburger introduce the different parts of the game of business, and the multiple interdependent roles that each player has.  In these blinks, you’ll discover how Super Mario ended up being more famous than Mickey Mouse; how to use contractual terms such as “most favored customer” to your advantage; and why people’s perceptions of how your business is doing are an important factor. What does it take to make it in the business world? Some people think it’s purely a matter of getting one over on the competition. In this view, business is like a race, and you just have to keep your fingers crossed that your main competitors will trip and fall along the way. But this metaphor doesn’t necessarily apply to all business. In reality, two business competitors might actually benefit from supporting each other, instead of trying to outrun each other.  To understand why, let’s divide business players into four groups. The first three are obvious: the customers, the suppliers and the competitors. The fourth group? These are the complementors.  In essence, complementors are products and services that supplement your product to make it more valuable. Hardware and software are perfect examples of a complementor duo: when people have better hardware, they need faster software, and vice versa.  It’s worth noting that there’s not always a clear divide between complementors and competitors. Although we’ve outlined distinct business roles – suppliers, customers and so on – players can also take on multiple roles.  Therefore, you might be cooperating with a player by adding value to your respective products and at the same time competing with them to determine how to divide the value between you. For example, in the cosmetics industry, manufacturers and retailers complement each other, as both play a vital role in supplying consumers with cosmetics. However, customers are only willing to pay a certain price for, say, lipstick, so manufacturers and retailers have to compete with each other when it comes to dividing up that sum. And that’s exactly where the term co-opetition comes from: it’s when two players cooperate and compete with each other at the same time.  These double roles may seem confusing, but being aware of them is essential if you want to develop an effective business strategy. Navigating the business world and understanding all the different players involved can be confusing. To make it a bit easier for yourself, use game theory, an approach for developing effective strategy when your actions depend on those of other players.  First, you need to assess each player’s relative position by unpacking the PARTS. The acronym PARTS represents the five elements of the business game:  Players Added value Rules Tactics and Scope. As explained in the previous blink, the four groups of players comprise customers, suppliers, competitors and complementors. Each player adds value to the game, and some more than others. This added value gives players power to negotiate and can thus be used as leverage to change the rules of the game. For instance, in the cosmetics industry, the retailers add value by controlling the distribution channel to consumers. The retailers could use this as leverage to change the rules of how much they pay the manufacturers for their products. In addition, each player’s distinct perception of the game determines their individual tactics, as well as their view of the game’s overall scope. For the cosmetics manufacturers, the scope of the game may only be the cosmetics industry, but for retailers like department stores it may encompass many other industries as well. Ultimately, the five elements of PARTS determine power relationships; each player’s relative power determines his or her performance.  And here’s where it gets interesting: you can change the elements of the game to attain a better position. The PARTS aren’t solid and inflexible: each and every element can be adjusted to your advantage.  It’s worth noting that any time an element of the game changes, the whole game changes with it. As such, it’s essential to think through each of these elements in order to develop a sound business strategy.  In the next blinks, you’ll learn exactly how to change the different elements of the game to gain a better position. When a business player thinks about entering the market, they often forget one important point: whenever the number of players changes, so does the game itself.  Your decision to enter the game might not necessarily be a bad thing for the existing player, and could even be as valuable to them as it is to you. After all, if you become a competitor to one player, another will profit. The customer, for example, will have more options if you decide to enter the market. This is why you should definitely make sure you’re getting compensated for your decision to enter the game. Ask your customers to contribute to your upfront costs or sign a guarantee that they’ll work with you – think of it as insurance.  This approach is all the more necessary if you consider the costs incurred when you enter the game in the first place. In order to enter the market, you have to spend time and money to craft an effective strategy and an attractive proposition. When venturing into a new game, you also risk losing your existing customers or provoking aggression and hostility from your new competitors.  But let’s say the first steps go well and you stay in the game. At this stage, you might benefit from bringing in new players; new customers and complementors will increase your existing value. Similarly, new suppliers could give you a better negotiating position. Even new competition can be valuable – at the very least, it will motivate you!  So, remember to look for incentives to bring others into the game with you. Remember the A in PARTS? Right, it stands for Added value, which refers to whatever a player brings to the game upon entering. It’s important to keep in mind that this added value isn’t a constant, fixed factor – you can change it. But first, why would you want to? Well, if you’re already adding value to the game, you can gain power by diminishing the added value of other players.  Imagine your business has a monopoly. Your added value is technically equal to the whole game because, well, you’re the only game in town! But even then, some players – like suppliers or customers – have their own added value, and you probably want it to be as small as possible.  As a monopolistic manufacturer of goods, you can achieve this by creating a supply shortage. This way, your customers have less added value, because there’s always someone to take their place.  That’s exactly the tactic Nintendo used in the late 1980s. The video game developer made sure there were never enough games on the market, creating frenzied consumer demand. As a result, Mario, the hero of the company’s best-selling game, became more famous than Mickey Mouse! On the flipside, in a competitive marketplace, increasing your own added value (and not changing anyone else’s) must be the priority. If you have loads of competition, it’s possible that your decision to exit the game would have zero impact on the industry. If so, that would imply that you have no added value! One way to make sure this doesn’t happen is through trade-offs – lowering the quality of your product in exchange for a lower consumer price.  Better yet, a trade-on – increasing a product’s value while simultaneously lowering production costs – will ensure added value. This works in the short term, but beware: the competition will catch up eventually.  A more sustainable strategy is to build customer relationships, because even if your products are only mediocre, gaining loyal customers will guarantee added value. When we’re children, other people’s rules govern our behavior: we cross the street when the light is green, go to bed when we’re told and walk through our elementary school hallways in single file.  But in adulthood, we can make up some of the rules ourselves. And in the business world, this changes the game completely. Here, rules determine how you must treat your employees, the environment and your customers. Of course, many rules like those relating to pricing are determined by laws, but the details are far more pliable than you might expect. Even though governments monitor business transactions and enforce antitrust regulations to keep the market fair, individual players have the autonomy to define the rules in contractual terms with their customers.  For instance, in your contract with the customer, she might demand a most-favored-customer (MFC) clause, stating that you’re going to give her a better price than any of your other customers. You can also negotiate a meet-the-competition (MCC) clause, which gives you the right to match the price any other competitor offers. This way, the customer can’t just leave you for a competitor; rather, you have the opportunity to keep them with a price cut.  Introducing these kinds of rules will change the balance of power between all players. The MFC and MCC clauses represent agreements with your customers, but they also change the relationship between you and the other players.  The MFC clause is ultimately about negotiating tough prices with everyone, since you can always tell your suppliers you have to reduce your overhead costs to make up for the losses incurred by your lower prices.  And with the MCC clause, you get to decide whether or not you want to keep the customer. You also save the time it would take to craft a proposition, since the required price is immediately clear. As you can see, these subtle shifts can have a big impact on the game as a whole.  The human mind is a powerful thing. In the business world, each player’s perception of the game can actually change the reality of game itself!  Why? Well, our ideas about how things work motivate our behavior. So, if you want to change how players in the game interact, start by changing their perceptions.  Imagine someone believes they’re doing poorly in a professional environment, such as in a negotiation situation. In order to improve their performance, they’re likely to behave more aggressively to try to make up for their lack of confidence. Unfortunately, this rarely works, as people are unwilling to be coerced by someone aggressive. On the other hand, someone who’s confident will be more at ease and thus able to calmly impose his or her own rules on others.  You can probably already see how disclosing, hiding or manipulating information can change other people’s perceptions, thus giving you power over their actions. Telegraphing strength is one way to selectively disclose information. For instance, you might invest in a nice suit and haircut for a job interview. This way, the hiring committee will get the message that you’ve been successful in the past, so you’re likely to be successful at their organization in the future.  Conversely, even if you’re in between jobs and having financial difficulties, wearing an old, ratty suit will send the wrong message. In some cases, it might even be better to keep certain information to yourself. Take the example of Frank Rice, president of Columbia Pictures, who sold the movie rights to ET for just $100,000 – before the movie went on to earn $400 million! That is definitely not the kind of misjudgement you would want to bring up in an interview. Finally, you can also change people’s perceptions by presenting information in a confusing way. For instance, you can mask high prices through a complex calculation method.  If you want to, you can look at anything in life as a big game. But here’s the thing: each game is part of another, bigger game. The simple fact that every game is linked to every other game means that your behavior as a player can have a ripple effect.  After all, what you do today in the television industry might impact what happens tomorrow in the political sphere; just one action can link two completely separate games. People tend not to see their reality in this way. For instance, they would rather think of this year’s and next year’s commodities markets as wholly distinct arenas, when in fact, these two games have a huge impact on each other! Employing this knowledge to change the scope of the game is the last PARTS lever. You simply have to look for the links between different games and use these links to your advantage.  That’s exactly what the video game company Sega did when it entered the market in the 1990s. Instead of going after Nintendo’s business, which was based around 8-bit systems, Sega developed 16-bit games. The company also set a higher price point for its product, well above what Nintendo was charging. As a result, they weren’t technically competing in the same market with the established video game giant.  In this way, Sega effectively expanded the scope of the game by dividing the market into 8-bit and 16-bit sectors; it thus avoided coming up against a powerful competitor and secured its own spot as an important player. The key message: In the business world, and within the game of business, players can cooperate and compete at the same time. The key is to thoughtfully approach each important element of the game; players, added value, rules, tactics and scope are all essential concepts you can use to improve your own position.  Actionable advice: Put your confidence forward.  When trying to project confidence as an employee, you could try to negotiate a contract that combines a relatively low base salary with a high performance bonus. Similarly, as a business, you could offer free trials or launch ridiculously expensive ad campaigns.  The point is, by taking on additional risks, you’ll demonstrate that you’re confident in your ability to deliver on your promises. In turn, the other party will be more likely to enter into a business relationship with you. Suggested further reading: Little Bets by Peter Sims The core principle of Little Bets is taking actions to discover, develop and test new ideas. Little bets start out small, then develop and are refined over time into potentially life-changing actions. Particularly valuable in times of uncertainty, small actions are cheap, low-risk and quickly put into practice, and are therefore massively helpful when undertaking any project. Got feedback?

If you are, you’ll be thrilled to find out how your networking savviness can help your enterprise to thrive. Or maybe the hype never reached you and you don’t know a lot about social networks yet. That’s no problem – these blinks will coach you step-by-step to make and cultivate valuable business contacts with the help of LinkedIn, a social network designed expressly for professional purposes. And thankfully, you won’t even have to share pictures of your meals to be liked.  Once you’re up-to-date on networking, you’ll find out about another internet option that can hugely boost your business success: webinars, or internet-based live seminars. With a single webinar, you can reach thousands of people around the world with minimal organizational effort. You can establish yourself as an expert without ever leaving your apartment. These blinks provide valuable advice on how to make webinars work for you.  You’ll also discover why everyone hates bagmen; why repeating the same ridiculous statement again and again isn’t as stupid as it sounds; and how pretending to be interested in another person can help you to sell things (being actually interested works even better, though).  Remember the last time someone tried to sell you a vacuum cleaner or a holiday over the phone? Did you get out your credit card? Probably not. Nevertheless, cold calling is still a commonly used sales tactic. Let’s look at exactly why you didn’t buy that vacuum cleaner. According to evolutionary psychology, not trusting strangers is instinctive. While studying tribal warfare, behavioral scientist Dr. Samuel Bowles found that people were more cooperative with those from their own tribe, and antagonistic toward strangers. Of course, the cold caller is a stranger to you, thus you instinctively keep your guard up. They can sing the praises of that vacuum cleaner all they want but chances are, you won’t trust them.  We are far more attracted to familiar things. The more familiar something or someone looks, the more attractive and trustworthy we deem them to be. This is also known as priming.  Priming is a mechanism that also works with images and statements. So, if you see a message more than once, you’re automatically more likely to believe it. This is why commercials are more effective than cold calling. If you see a commercial for that vacuum cleaner a couple of times, it will be more desirable to you. Not only is it ineffective, cold calling actually drives potential customers away. Why? Because it’s annoying! It’s based on a strategy called interruption marketing, which disrupts your current activity and attempts to draw your attention toward the product. Examples of this include intrusive Google ads, billboards, Facebook posts and TV commercials. It’s not unlike someone stalking you with a megaphone and shouting product slogans every two minutes. You’d naturally hate that, and cold calling is no different. Now, let’s say you’re a salesperson: you know cold calling is a dead end, so how can you deal with your client? Easy: make them believe you’re part of their tribe. Read on to find out how.  Meet Bob Sanders, one of the author’s clients. Having gained many years’ experience in the construction business, Bob is now setting up his own construction consultancy and is eager to attract clients. How can he make the business contacts he needs? One way is through LinkedIn, a sort of business version of Facebook. If you’re in business, using LinkedIn is almost mandatory. Currently, LinkedIn has around 400,000,000 members, with 40 percent of them checking the site daily. Let’s go back to Bob. Bob created a profile page displaying his CV, skills, interests and his network. He created a page for his construction consultancy to show what it does and to share product information. Should he ever need to search for a new employee, he can post a vacancy on this page. Recruiting via LinkedIn is becoming increasingly common because it’s great for searching for specific candidates. Of course, job seekers also use it to research potential employers. Being visible on LinkedIn is important, but the real power of the site is as a B2B (business-to-business) marketing tool. LinkedIn enables you to systematically connect with specific prospects and convert them into customers. One effective way of connecting is to use LinkedIn groups. There are more than two million different groups on the site that are formed around common interests such as “Behavioral Economics,” or around location, like “Berlin Start-ups.” You can join up to 50 groups and share content, instigate discussions or take part in existing conversations. Whenever you participate in a group like this, thousands of people will see it. Bob, for example, follows several groups focusing on housing and construction in Indianapolis. Say you’ve set up a profile, made some connections with some group members and are active in a couple of groups. What now? Create your own group! In Bob’s case he formed the group “Construction in Indianapolis.”  Of course a group is nothing without members, so you’ll need to go about selecting some people. You don’t want to send an open invitation to everyone you can find – you need people relevant to your business. When considering potential group members, think about which companies are relevant to you, including their size, location and industry. Bob chose housing and construction in Indianapolis, and small- and medium-sized companies. Next, determine which people you want to target. You can do this by making a list of all the job titles of your current clients. This list may include titles such as “building planner” or “property manager.” You can find people by job title easily on LinkedIn and afterward you can refine your search.  For example, if you search for “property manager” and get 355,642 results from all over the world, you should narrow down your results by specifying a location, such as Indianapolis. This will make your results more manageable. Next, it’s time to send out connection requests – much like friend requests on Facebook – to the most relevant and important people on your list, and follow this up with a couple of casual messages. Take care to address everybody by name and, if applicable, add a compliment, like “Congrats on your new job.” Then you can follow this up with something that’s useful for them, such as alerting them to news articles that you think they might be interested in. Connecting in this way will put you a cut above the rest of the competition in the eyes of your prospects. Have you ever tried to market yourself or your company by writing a book or speaking at conferences? Although these approaches may work for some, they can drain both time and money. The good news is that you can make real headway by making good use of your LinkedIn group. A LinkedIn group can be enough to position yourself ahead of the pack in your industry. But how do you get it right? First, make your group exclusive. As you’re the owner, you can determine who will be invited to join it. Remember to focus on key decision-makers and C level managers, meaning CEOs, CFOs, CTOs and so on. To ensure that invitees are seen as equal, make sure that C-level members of your own company are listed as group founders by name and position. When sending invitations, aim for up to a couple of thousand. You can start off with the prospects you are already in contact with thanks to your messaging campaign. Additionally, you can invite members from similar groups and use your homepage or other social media channels outside LinkedIn to further build the group’s membership. Next, you need to think about content. It’s crucial to find and share relevant content in order to gain respect as a leader. But what is the right content and where can you get it? You need to look out for everything that’s relevant for your prospects’ business. This can be anything from industry trends and statistics, to government regulations and news about related industries. Sounds like it might involve some intensive internet trawling, right? It’s easier than you think: first find out the most relevant sites for your industry and then enlist the help of a feed aggregator such as Feedly.com. A feed aggregator is a service which collects all noteworthy news from the sites you have selected.  Once the people relevant to your business are listening to you, that’s great. But you want to turn your contacts into clients! Read on to see how. Have you ever attended a webinar? Maybe you don’t know what a webinar is, but take note – it’ll soon become a valuable tool for you.  Webinars are live seminars, lectures or tutorials, hosted on the web. During a webinar, a speaker will typically guide you through some PowerPoint slides which will be visible on your screen. Because they combine online scalability with the power of public speaking, webinars can make for highly effective business development tools. Another great advantage is that the location of the speaker and attendees is irrelevant. In Bob’s case, he could be at home in Indianapolis while talking to potential customers in Ohio or Chicago. Delivering a good public talk will also work wonders for your credibility and boost the visibility of your company. Of course during your webinar, you’ll want to share useful content and knowledge with your audience. Knowledge is power, and appearing knowledgeable through a webinar will reinforce your leader status. What makes webinars slightly different to run-of-the-mill group content, however, is that at the end of a webinar, it’s common to include a product pitch or at least a small company presentation. Bear in mind that your webinar should be worth your prospects’ time. Your audience won’t want to listen to you rant about useless information, so if they make the effort to attend your webinar, you should make it worthwhile for them and for you. This means sharing valuable content, so make sure you research what your audience – your potential prospects – really care about. If your audience is bored stiff during your webinar, this could irritate them and erode your relationship. Remember to not be afraid of shining a positive light on what you do by integrating successful case studies and examples from your own business. What is the worst thing that can happen to a party? No one shows up. The same goes for webinars. Imagine you’ve practiced over and over and learned your presentation by heart. But there are only five people coming and one of them is your intern. Let’s see how you can avoid this disheartening scenario and make sure your webinar is a roaring success. First, choose the right time and day. Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday tend to be the days most people can attend a webinar, but double-check if this is true for your particular audience.  In the States, between 10 a.m. and 11 a.m. Pacific Time is ideal, as this allows people from all four US time zones to attend. To draw in more participants, use a catchy title and create an enticing starting page. You can make your title appealing by demonstrating how useful the webinar will be to the potential attendee. For instance, “How to generate 235 leads in seven minutes a day using LinkedIn.” Next, invest some time and effort in your landing page. This is where people arrive after clicking on an advert in your LinkedIn group to get more information and to register. For this, you can use LeadPages – software that helps you create effective landing pages. You could also make a couple of different versions to see which one works best. Now you’ll need to promote, and LinkedIn can help here, too. By now, you probably have some promising LinkedIn contacts to tell about your webinar. The best way to get the highest response rate is to send out personally customized invitations. In groups, you can also send out an announcement to all members. This works best if you use an informal tone, as if you were talking to a friend about something interesting and cool they might like. Now you may still be a bit skeptical, even after you’ve put everything into your webinar. Will it actually lead to sales? The answer depends on how you end your webinar. The stock webinar ending is a slide containing your contact information and a brief text like “I’d be happy to arrange a complimentary consultation.” This is simple and clear but it still puts you in the passive position of waiting for others to call you. And of course that may never happen. To ensure the webinar leads to profitable follow-up conversations, get active and make feedback phone calls. In the initial part of the conversation ask for feedback, but in the second part, ask questions like “Have you been able to integrate some of the concepts discussed at the webinar?” When people reply to questions like this, it often opens the door to a sales conversation. The best way to turn webinar participants into business prospects is to tailor your approach to their willingness to make a deal with you. To do this, first determine their level of approachability: On the first level, you have the hot prospects – those who are excited and eager to get in touch with you. Their interest in your service or product is already piqued and this group is the one you should target first. As you may have guessed, you shouldn’t have problems converting them into actual customers. On the second tier, there are the warm prospects – those who are only slightly interested. Then on the third tier, you have prospects who aren’t potential buyers now, but might be at some point in the future. It might be more appropriate to contact these two groups via email – for example, with a recap of the webinar – as they won’t have displayed enough enthusiasm for you to contact them straight away by phone. Your webinar or your LinkedIn campaign was successful and you’re inundated with new contacts. Great! But how about closing some deals and making some money? For this, you’ll need to make a few phone calls, but you’d better make them good. In any sales call it’s crucial to take your time and form some kind of connection with the person you’re speaking to. Remember, people would much rather buy from their own tribe! Thus, everything will run more smoothly if they trust you and perceive you as familiar.  To foster this sense of familiarity, engage in a few minutes of small talk before even mentioning your product or service. Simple icebreaking questions like “Mike, help me, what part of the country are you in?” can make all the difference. One common and vital type of call you’ll make is the networking call. Say you’re talking with a prospect who doesn’t want to buy anything from you, at least right now. They just want to get to know you and what your business is about. Start by asking them about their own product or company. Sprinkle in some small talk, and find out some common ground between you, such as people you both know.  You should do this for up to ten minutes and let the prospect do most of the talking, with you asking questions. As they’re talking, monitor what they’re saying for any signs of the company’s needs and problems. Here, you can pose some questions to glean as much information as you can. A word of warning though – don’t make them feel like they’re being grilled. When they have spoken for some time and you’ve found some common ground, you can say something like: “Mike, I was not sure where this call would go but after what you’ve mentioned in this conversation, I got the feeling you might be interested in what my company does. Because we helped similar companies like yours solving issues like X. Would you like to hear more about it?” The key message in this book: LinkedIn is a highly effective tool for connecting with business professionals the world over. By knowing who to contact and how to contact them, and by enlisting the power of webinars, you can use your LinkedIn connections to generate sales leads and seal the deal with your target customers. Actionable advice:  Warm people up for your webinar.  When your next webinar is approaching, try to build some rapport with those planning to attend. Send them a friendly email, a free product or, even better, try to exchange a few text messages with them. Doing these very basic things will make invitees more likely to perceive you as familiar and trustworthy and they’ll be much more inclined to attend your webinar.   Suggested further reading: Ask by Ryan Levesque Ask (2015) is based on a simple idea – that learning what your customer wants is as simple as asking. The trick is asking in the right way. Full of immediately actionable insights into customer behavior, Ask gives you all the tools you need to uncover what your customers really want and give it to them. Got Feedback?

In your personal life, do you take responsibility for your actions, communicate constructively and importantly, live according to your own values? Now ask yourself whether you do business consciously. Do you negotiate contracts with your values in mind? Do you communicate as constructively with your employees as you do with your children?  It’s clear that in today’s fast-paced business world, doing business consciously is the key to success – yet how do you turn your company into a conscious business? These blinks will help guide you toward creating a business based on values that work.  In these blinks, you’ll learn why balancing the it, the we and the I is good for business; how to resolve conflicts through constructive negotiations; and how to answer the question: am I a player or a victim? In Good to Great, author Jim Collins shows how the most successful companies are the ones that strive for more than financial success, as they’re motivated by higher values.  But how is it exactly that values could create a successful company? Many successful businesses are powered by conscious employees. They take responsibility for their actions and know how to communicate constructively, without compromising their core values.  Unconscious employees, on the other hand, tend to undermine a business as they often blame others for problems and see themselves as the victim. They aren’t self-aware, and thus are not able to act according to higher values.  This is why managers should make it a priority to hire conscious employees.  Yet if you want to build a truly conscious business, you can’t stop here. You must also cultivate a balance among the impersonal, the interpersonal and the personal dimensions of your company.  The impersonal is the “it,” things like shareholder value, productivity and other technical considerations inherent to any business.   The interpersonal is the “we,” or the relationships among different people within your company.  And the personal, of course, is the “I,” relating to each individual’s happiness and desire for meaningful work and a mindful life.  Yet instead of creating a harmonious relationship among these three, most managers tend to focus entirely on “it,” the impersonal elements of a business.  When a company neglects its human elements (the interpersonal and the personal), business is a mindless activity, in which failure or success hinges only on managing arbitrary technical matters.  In a conscious business, however, harmony exists among the three core dimensions.  So how do you create a business built on harmony and core values? Read on! When something goes wrong at work, do you blame someone else for what may have been your mistake?  If yes, then it’s high time you start taking responsibility for your actions.  Generally speaking, there are two kinds of people in the workplace: players and victims.  You want to be a player – players build self-esteem from taking action as well as taking responsibility for their actions. A player knows she’s not omnipotent; she realizes that while there are plenty of things outside her control, her goal is to focus only on what she can control.  On the other hand, victims build themselves up by blaming everyone else and deluding themselves into thinking they always act perfectly. You see this a lot in the business world, where CEOs and managers point to external factors for failures, instead of their own shortcomings.  A sales manager, Esteban, has a team of sales executives. He just found out that the human resources department went ahead and scheduled staff vacations without consulting him. Now he’s going to be understaffed in February, the busiest month of the year.  In a huff, Esteban insisted that this issue was HR’s problem, not his own; so he didn’t do anything about it.  Yet since Esteban would be the one suffering the consequences, he was the one with the problem – even if he didn’t create it initially. So instead of playing the victim, he could have taken action to solve the problem himself.  So how do you go from being a victim to being a player? Start by adopting the language players use.  Instead of saying, “It’s hopeless,” say, “I haven’t found a solution yet.” And similarly, instead of being passive and saying, “I have to leave,” say, “I want to leave.” This way, you’ll become more aware of your responsibility regarding what happens around you. Which is exactly what being a player is all about! Children do things just for the fun of it, without thinking too much about goals or what they want to accomplish. This attitude changes once we become adults. Many of us become too focused on outcomes rather than on so-called process attributes.  In one study, when participants were asked to name people they admired, they rarely chose a person who was wealthy, powerful, beautiful or even famous. That is, participants didn’t choose individuals with attributes generally associated with success in Western culture.  But even though these attributes might not matter to us deep down, we still tend to focus on them. And that’s why we sometimes wrongly care more about outcomes than about process.  When an athlete loses a race, he still worked really hard to get to the point of competing – that’s process. We don’t celebrate that effort, but we could. Actually, scratch that: we should!  When you do something you believe in for that reason alone, you get success beyond success. Focusing on outcome won’t allow you to achieve this level of success; you must express your innermost values to do so.  There are always things you just wouldn’t do, right? Thus, your actions aren’t just a means to reach a certain outcome – they also express your values. And that’s how you build integrity, by consistently acting in accordance with your values.  Barry is an automotive plant manager with an assembly team. The team realized that some machines, produced by another factory, didn’t perform as well as they should. When they approached the other factory manager, he wasn’t interested in change. So Barry’s team kept searching for a solution.  From a process perspective, the team had already succeeded. In fact, they had success beyond success: instead of sacrificing their values and making substandard cars, they preserved their integrity and continued to look for ways to improve. Are you often frustrated because your colleagues don’t see things the way you do? While it might be hard to accept, everyone sees the world differently. Developmental psychologist Jean Piaget came up with what is now a classic experiment about perspective. He gave children blocks of wood, with one side painted green, the other red.  Piaget then held a block, with the red side toward him and the green side toward the group of children, and asked them what color they saw.  The children answered “green.” Then he asked what color they thought he saw. The children under five years old said “green,” yet the older children answered “red.” Thus those older children had come to a point in their development in which they could change perspective, seeing the world from another person’s eyes.  Yet just like younger children, we too often forget that perspective is subjective. And this can be a major source of conflict in organizations.  So what’s the solution? The goal is to develop ontological humility, a state in which you are able to recognize other people’s points of view.  Different cultural backgrounds lead to different ways of seeing and acting. But just because someone has a different approach doesn’t make it any less valuable than your own.  If you can’t recognize and respect those differences, it will only lead to conflict and worse, harm.  In fact, a management study conducted by the Wall Street Journal in 1996 showed that cultural differences in operating styles, communication and customer relations were at the very top of the list of problems at most companies.  It’s sad, but true. Many of our conversations aren’t really meaningful dialogues but overlapping monologues. We say one thing when we should say something else; and we really don’t listen to what our partner is saying.  This makes “conversation” extremely unproductive – and collaborative work near impossible.  So how do you improve your conversations for the better?  There are three levels to every conversation. First, there’s the task, or the issue at hand. Then there’s the relationship, or the emotional bond between speakers. And finally, there’s the self, or each speaker’s identity and level of self-esteem. When it comes to conversation in a business context, you might feel threatened on each of these levels, but especially on the level of self.  And when this happens, you might withdraw or behave over-confidently to protect your self-image. Sure, it’s natural, but doing so will hold you back, preventing you from interrogating your own viewpoints and openly exploring other people’s ideas. Plus, this kind of defensiveness is incompatible with good communication. To have productive conversations, you have to establish common ground and say what you really mean.  To that end, productive expression, which is all about finding common ground, is the key to productive communication. For example, if you have a disagreement with an employee, engaging in productive expression would entail both parties describing the problem from their own perspective. That way, you can try to solve the issue in a fashion that feels fair/adequate on both sides.  Another tip is to provide facts. This makes it easier to establish common ground.  Think of the difference between saying, “Our help desk stinks,” compared with, “Last month only 20 percent of calls were picked up within three minutes.” The latter is factual, clear and easy to understand, which makes it a much better starting point for a productive conversation. Do you thrive on conflict? Ugh, who does? But the thing is, when conflict isn’t handled properly, it can have serious consequences.  The most common methods of dealing with conflict in business are, unfortunately, deeply flawed.  Denial is one example of a bad approach. Denial is like closing your eyes when hiking up a mountain, pretending the jagged cliffs don’t exist. It might feel safer than looking, but it’s much riskier.  Many managers tell themselves that employees work well together when in fact, the office is paralyzed with power struggles and sinking in pernicious gossip. Avoidance is another common yet faulty approach. Instead of pretending a problem doesn’t exist, avoidance involves acknowledging the issue but refusing to deal with it.  Many managers here too realize that conflict is slowing down work and creating a toxic atmosphere within teams, but instead of creating a plan to resolve the issues, they simply avoid the problem.  Both of these bad approaches are based on the assumption that any possible solution will either have a winner and a loser or a watered-down compromise that no one will like. (Compromise is often talked about as a good thing, but all it really means is that nobody actually gets what they want.)  The thinking goes that there’s no reason to try and resolve a conflict, since the outcome will surely disappoint someone. But you can resolve conflicts positively if you engage in constructive negotiation.  Constructive negotiation is a way of creating space for new possibilities, by encouraging people to be less competitive and more cooperative. That’s why an atmosphere of mutual learning is so important – without it, constructive negotiation is simply impossible. You can be emotional and rational – these two states are not independent of one another. In fact, our rational mind would break down without guidance from our emotional mind.  Still, as we all know, emotions can mess things up, which is why you need to master your feelings. There are many different skills involved with controlling your emotions. Self-awareness and self-acceptance are particularly important ones. Self-awareness has a slightly circular definition, in that it’s about realizing that you control your level of awareness. So when you say, “I feel afraid,” it’s actually not all of you that’s afraid. There’s also a part of you that’s observing your fear.  And when you learn to become aware of that observational part, you’ll have more control over your emotions. You’ll be able to stand “outside” and observe, without having to act on every single emotional impulse.  And by choosing which emotions to act on, you’ll become a more responsible, reliable person.  Ultimately, self-awareness is about changing your perspective. Instead of looking at the world through your emotions, you examine your emotions independently.  Self-acceptance is about realizing that you don’t have control over what you feel; you can only change how you act.  There’s another competency that’ll help you master your emotions – forgiveness.  Forgiveness doesn’t mean you have to pretend everything’s hunky-dory when it isn’t. It’s also not about adopting a holier than thou attitude.  Rather, forgiveness is simply about letting go of anger and creating space for positive change. The first time the author lost a game of Scrabble to his son, he made an astounding realization: when you love your opponent, it’s impossible to suffer from a competitive loss.  And the author then wondered, what if business was based on such a principle? Generally speaking, concern develops in stages. The first stage is egocentric: at this stage, we’re only concerned with our own well-being.  The second stage is ethnocentric, when an individual sees himself as part of a community. Instead of only caring about their own well-being, people also care about other tribe members.  The third stage is world-centric, when it’s not just about us but about all of us in the world. Research suggests that only about 15 percent of the adult population operates at this level of concern.  Even fewer people have reached the fourth, spirit-centric stage. Such individuals experience a wholeness that transcends all superficial divisions; for them, all competition is cooperation and opposition is just an opportunity for everyone to excel.  Only about half of one percent of the world’s population is truly spirit-centric! At this highest level of consciousness, everything you do becomes a game – and you don’t play to win, you play just to keep playing! This is the real purpose of business.  Of course you’ll still have to make money and accomplish goals, but your ultimate objective should be to develop and express your highest inner nature.  All in all, when you successfully create an organization filled with responsible individuals who have integrity and feel their work is value-aligned, you go beyond “business as usual” to creating a truly conscious business.  The key message in this book: By creating space for personal values in business, you can build a company that is effective, profitable and deeply committed to the well-being and integrity of those around you.  Suggested further reading: Reinventing Organizations by Frederic Laloux Reinventing Organizations discusses why companies around the world are getting rid of bosses, introducing flat hierarchies and pursuing purpose over profit. And ultimately, by adopting a non-hierarchical model, these organizations thrive. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

If you want to play a video game, your choices are many, and often overwhelming – first-person shooter or fantasy exploration, dedicated console or PC or handheld. Just 20 years ago, however, things were very different. In the 1990s, if you played games, you played a Nintendo game. In the United States, this company dominated the market and carefully controlled which games could be played on its consoles. That is, until Sega and its rambunctious blue hedgehog wreaked havoc in the gaming industry. These blinks tell the captivating story of how Sega and Nintendo battled for control of the video games market. With a flair for shock marketing, blood-splattered games and frisky gaming characters, Sega turned the industry on its head and set it on the modern path we know today. In the following blinks, you’ll also discover: why gamers prefer their characters to bleed red and not gray; how Sega blundered and helped create the Sony Playstation; and how a blue hedgehog with an attitude tripped up a polite Italian with a mustache. If you owned a game console in 1990, there's a good chance it was made by Nintendo. Nintendo, a Japanese consumer electronics company, completely dominated the market for video games. In the United States at the time, the company claimed some 90 percent market share! This dominance stemmed largely from Nintendo's strict control over who could create games for its console. If a company was interested in developing a game for Nintendo, it would have to purchase a game cartridge at a fixed cost of $10 – which meant games always sold for more than $10, regardless whether it was a hit or a flop. This policy ensured that Nintendo would collect huge profits on highly successful games such as Street Fighter II, developed by Capcom; it also allowed Nintendo to closely control which companies produced games for its consoles. Nintendo obviously was protective of its market clout. When a group of developers tried to create games for the console without Nintendo's approval, the company sued them. For many developers, the threat of losing favor with Nintendo (which could result in being ostracized from the market entirely) kept them loyal and obedient to the company’s dictates. However, being a market leader has its downsides. Nintendo had to continuously push new products and take large risks to maintain its position in the market. Yet many of the products Nintendo pushed out were of poor quality, and in the rush to release new products, it made many mistakes. For example, the company’s updated 16-bit console, released in the United States in 1991, was not compatible with games from its previous console. This angered many console owners, who were forced to buy their favorite games a second time. These sorts of mistakes, combined with the ire of games manufacturers that Nintendo had effectively shut out of the market, created an opening for a new competitor. That company was Sega, and it arrived ready to take advantage of Nintendo's weaknesses. The epic battle of David and Goliath, while an often overused metaphor, is apt in the case of Sega versus Nintendo. When Sega made its entrance into the video game market, no one expected that the company could take on the dominant Nintendo – and yet it did. But how did the company do it? Sega identified the perfect market niche. By pinpointing all of Nintendo's flaws and missteps, the upstart created a market image for itself that was exactly the opposite. One of Nintendo’s weak spots was that the company was seen as over-controlling, even paternalistic. Many gamers also felt that Nintendo’s titles were too focused on children’s games. So Sega decided to offer more freedom to game developers, and what’s more, encouraged the development of more titles for adults. As a result, the range of Sega games was much more diverse as developers had a freer hand to create what they wanted. And importantly, Sega wanted its company brand to contrast with Nintendo’s staid, monolithic image. It wanted to be seen as fun, even rebellious ‒ the underdog with a mean bite! Even Sonic the Hedgehog – Sega's mascot – was designed to contrast with Nintendo's main game character, Mario. When Sega released its 16-bit console, the Genesis (called the Mega Drive in Europe and Asia), the company included the Sonic the Hedgehog game for free. While Mario was a clean living, family-friendly cartoon man with a mustache, Sonic was a prickly, bright blue hedgehog that was unruly and moved incredibly fast – just like Sega. The Sonic character was an instant hit and quickly became a pop icon, as many people, not just gamers, believed Sonic’s attitude captured the speed and zaniness of the decade. Coke versus Pepsi. McDonalds versus Burger King. Apple versus Microsoft. Many of the top corporate players market themselves deliberately against their main competitors. Sega employed comparison marketing to gain an edge over Nintendo, as we’ve seen with regards to the company’s image. But Sega didn't stop there. Its sales strategy too sought to capitalize on the differences between the two companies.   When Nintendo released its 16-bit Super Nintendo (SNES) console, Sega took its own product, the Genesis console, on a tour of shopping malls in the United States, calling the event the Sega World Tour. The strategy was to poach customers who were essentially looking to buy Nintendo’s new SNES. The tour showcased the antics and gaming excitement of Sonic the Hedgehog, in stark contrast to Nintendo’s tired, old Mario. It was a great success. The Genesis continued to sell well, despite the release of the SNES. Another head-to-head challenge came about when both companies released a version of Mortal Kombat, a fantastical fighting game. Nintendo attempted to make its version less realistic, even choosing to make the fighters’ blood the color gray instead of red. Sega, in contrast, offered an uncensored version, complete with red-colored blood and the option to enter a special code to make the match even bloodier. The Sega version was much more popular. And even though Nintendo had a much larger marketing budget than Sega, the upstart revolutionized game releases with an innovative approach and lots of flash. Previously, to buy a game title you would go to a game retailer and see what was new. Sega transformed this process, making the release of new titles big media events. When Sega released Sonic 2, the company declared it “Sonic 2 Day,” and organized events around the world to coincide with the launch. It worked, and the game, the console and the company garnered tremendous publicity as a result. So Sega quickly and successfully established itself as an unconventional, creative and radical gaming company. But behind the wacky facade, Sega still had to do business. Even the most creative, unconventional companies still need structure and talented employees to function. Sega's success in America began when Sega in America (SOA) got a new head, Tom Kalinske. Kalinske had previously worked at Mattel, where he'd helped create the powerful, muscular character He-Man, as well as helped to resurrect the popularity of Barbie. When Kalinske took the helm at Sega, he first had to smooth a lot of mistrust that had grown among team members at the company. Much of the ire was directed at one employee, named Shinobu Toyoda. Many of Toyoda’s American colleagues thought that he was a spy for Sega’s parent company in Japan. Kalinske put a stop to this. He openly declared his trust for Toyoda and encouraged others to do the same. Kalinske united the company, created a team spirit, and developed a creative and positive atmosphere. Sega needed this. The company could only overcome one of its greatest obstacles – distribution – if employees worked together. Many retailers were afraid that if they stocked Sega products, they'd lose Nintendo as a customer. The Sega team had to work hard to persuade retailers that this was not the case. For example, Sega had to put a lot of effort into convincing Wal-Mart to stock its products. Sega’s top brass had to meet with Wal-Mart executives regularly, while the marketing department worked overtime to come up with effective advertising strategies. The company’s efforts eventually won Wal-Mart over. Timing was also a key skill of Sega executives. They were experts at knowing when to launch advertising campaigns or release new products, and the company continued to succeed. Sega also had to anticipate Nintendo price cuts and react accordingly. On one occasion, executives found out that Nintendo was about to reduce prices for its consoles the night before the announcement. The Sega team worked the whole night and managed to cut its console price first. Thus customers thought Nintendo was copying Sega’s price cut! When Mortal Kombat was released, Sega eclipsed Nintendo as the market leader. Yet this was the peak for the company; and today, Sega consoles are only a memory. So what happened? Read on to find out. There are two main paths for gaming companies like Nintendo or Sega, in terms of growth. You could create new software by developing games, or create new hardware by developing consoles. Making such a strategic decision is tricky. You have to consider what strategy will require more time and effort, and what choice is likely to bring in more sales. Sega, however, knew what it wanted: it opted for the hardware route, which was a risky decision. When the Genesis and SNES consoles both needed updating, Nintendo and Sega used vastly different strategies. Nintendo played it safe with its Super FX chip, which offered a rather simple upgrade to its existing console. Sega, on the other hand, went for something revolutionary: the Sega CD. The Sega CD was technologically superior to Nintendo’s upgrade, but cost much more to develop and in turn, was more expensive for retail customers. While the technology was innovative, the cost was prohibitive, and few people bought it. Sega also faltered with its follow-up console to Genesis, the Saturn. The company failed to offer enough new, high-quality Saturn games to satisfy customers who had bought the console. In short, Sega had too many devices. In addition to Genesis and Saturn, the company also had the Game Gear. Game developers couldn’t churn out titles fast enough for so many different technologies. Moreover, Sega couldn't match the demand for Saturn. It struggled to produce and distribute enough consoles to satisfy its fans, which turned many against the company. Thus Sega's rapid growth came to a halt. The nail in the proverbial coffin came when Nintendo released its game Donkey Kong Country in 1994. Since Sega’s brief moment at the top of the gaming world, Nintendo had caught up again and surpassed Sega in sales. We tend to think of companies as one big entity. There’s one General Motors (GM), one General Electric (GE), one Nintendo and one Sega. However, company structures are far more complex. Sega of Japan (SOJ) was the “original” Sega, based in Japan. The subsidiary, Sega of America (SOA), was based in the United States and managed by Tom Kalinske. Interestingly, SOA was the much more successful of the two companies. In the United States, Sega was a market leader, but its parent company never reached the same status in Japan. SOA's market strategies were more lucrative, but also very different. SOJ was never ready to take the risks that SOA did. Al Nilsen, SOA’s global marketing director, realized this when he travelled to Japan and went to a restaurant with his colleagues. His Japanese colleagues ordered him fugu, a fish that if not prepared correctly, can be poisonous. Nilsen tried it, then offered some of the fish to his colleagues. They politely declined. Nilsen realized then that SOJ and its employees liked to play it safe, unlike the team at SOA. SOJ had only allowed SOA so much independence in the beginning because Hayao Nakayama, SOJ's head, had trusted Kalinske. Gradually, however, SOJ began to chip away at SOA's freedom. The parent company listened to SOA’s input less and less, or just ignored it altogether. A flash point came when SOJ overruled SOA on the issue of the Genesis console's life cycle. SOA had calculated what it thought to be the ideal lifespan for the console, only to have SOJ come up with a completely different calculation. SOJ chose to enforce its calculation, and pulled the device from shelves when it was still selling well. This decision ended up costing the company its leading position in the American console market. In a fast-paced, creative market like the video games market, it's not unusual for different companies to work together, especially when they have compatible skills. Unfortunately for Sega, this was not the philosophy of its parent company. SOJ refused to cooperate with other firms because it didn't want to lose the tight control it had over the company as a whole. One of the joint ventures executives turned down was a potentially lucrative deal with Japanese consumer electronics company Sony. Sony was keen to enter the video games market, but it was more interested in developing software than hardware. This was a great opportunity for Sega, especially because it had experience with CD-ROMs, through its Sega CD and Sega Saturn consoles. However, SOJ flatly turned the offer down, even after negotiations between the two companies had reached an advanced stage. This mistake backfired in a big way. Since Sony couldn't collaborate with Sega, it decided to develop its own console, the PlayStation. When the PlayStation was released, in terms of competitive advantage, it blew Sega’s Saturn out of the water. Sega's stubborn refusal to partner didn't end with Sony. The company also started talks with Silicon Graphics (SGI) for a move to producing 3-D games, but then Sega got cold feet again and refused a deal. Kalinske was so frustrated at being forced to refuse another deal that he gave SGI executives the phone number of Nintendo as an alternative! Even internally, SOJ was reluctant to make deals with SOA. Initially, the American spin-offs of both Nintendo and Sega could only produce games with the approval of the Japanese parent company. Yet Nintendo eventually decided to give its U.S. subsidiary the freedom to develop games on its own. With this new latitude, Nintendo’s U.S. arm worked with a British company to develop Donkey Kong Country, the game that cost Sega its market leadership. Kalinske came to realize that the real battle wasn't Sega versus Nintendo, but Sega America versus Sega Japan. When Tom Kalinske took the reins at Sega, it seemed like the company had little chance of survival. Not only did Nintendo dominate the games market, but the market itself was young and its future uncertain. Over the next few years, however, Sega didn't just become successful – the company revolutionized the video games industry. Its aggressive marketing philosophy changed forever how games would be developed, released and consumed. In 1990, the video game market was worth $3 billion globally, with some 90 percent of the market controlled by Nintendo in the United States alone. By 1994, the playing field had grown, with the market worth $15 billion worldwide and $6 billion in the United States, with Sega in the lead. This rapid growth inspired social change, too. For the first time, lawmakers and politicians began to view the video games industry as something that needed regulation, like television or film. After Sega released Mortal Kombat, the U.S. Congress held hearings about violence and video games. These hearings led to the creation of a regulatory group that would put age limits and ratings on video games that were considered too extreme or violent for minors. Games themselves changed too. In the short period from 1990 to 1994, the technological improvements of games are stark. While early games were slow, with blocky graphics and limited in scope, games post-1994 were more colorful, more responsive and offered faster action. So even though Sega's success was short-lived, its influence changed the industry forever. Video games as we know them today owe much of their character to the rivalry between Sega and Nintendo, and Sega's rapid rise to the top. The key message in this book: While Sega's success was short-lived, the company’s influence and innovative approach changed the industry significantly. In the early 1990s, Sega managed to topple the market leader Nintendo and established new standards in game production and marketing. Although the battle between Nintendo and Sega was brief, today’s gaming environment is still very much influenced by this historic competitive rivalry.

But what if, at the beginning, you didn’t need a unique product? Wouldn’t that be a relief? Well, wipe the sweat from your brow, because, initially, there is indeed no need for uniqueness. You can create an audience and make them buy your product later. Content creation doesn’t require you to push a product forward. Instead, you must tune in to the deepest wants of consumers. This will help you identify the sweet spot where you can monetize your content. In these blinks, you’ll learn how Andy Schneider turned his backyard poultry interest into a great entrepreneurial success; how Matthew Patrick combined his acting skills and a passion for mathematics and gaming to create great content on YouTube; and how to generate revenue from your content right from the very beginning. If you have a product you want to share with the world, then you have to attract buyers. Now, the traditional approach to marketing mainly focuses on advertising – but, these days, people are all but buried under an avalanche of ads. This makes it hard for advertisers to stand out. So, if advertising isn’t as effective as it used to be, what’s the best way to get your product noticed? Today’s customers are drawn to creative content, not advertising. The Content Council is a global non-profit organization focused on content marketing. Their studies show that 61 percent of people are more likely to buy a company’s products when that company provides content that is uniquely tailored to a specific audience. These statistics are supported by the marketing hub, Content+, whose research indicates that 70 percent of consumers prefer becoming familiar with a company through articles and content rather than advertisements. While this shift from advertising to creative content is a significant change from traditional marketing practices, it’s actually great news for small business owners and start-ups. Back in the day, if a company wanted to reach millions of people, they’d have to run a costly advertising campaign. But today, even the smallest companies have access to the technology and platforms needed to create and use the kind of content that can build a large and loyal customer base. These methods also afford you the opportunity to get a competitive advantage by better understanding your customers’ needs. Unlike traditional advertising, content offers important and immediate insight into what your potential customers connect with. Pay attention to how potential customers engage and respond to your content by, for instance, reading the comments they leave and tracking how they share it. You can even do this during the production phase of your product. By creating content and keeping an eye on what your potential customers are most excited about, you can focus on those aspects. This will help ensure its success when it goes to market. Before you can put content to use, you need to identify what you want to write about. So, the first step on the path to success is locating your sweet spot: the combination of something you are especially skilled at, or knowledgeable about, and something you are passionate about. Passion is important. If you’re starting a business, you should be prepared to stick with it for the long haul – a task that will be easier if you’re truly passionate about it. To figure out your sweet spot, try making two lists. First, list all the things you are knowledgeable about, and then everything you’re skilled at. Finally, consider what you are passionate about and what gets you motivated; it could be anything, from cooking tasty meals to helping others. Entrepreneur Andy Schneider’s passion is teaching and his unique skill is raising chickens in his backyard. Before long, Schneider realized he wasn’t alone; a lot of other people were interested in raising their own chickens and regularly asked him for information. Schneider saw an opportunity to put his passion for teaching into action by holding regular meetings about backyard poultry in Atlanta. Five years later, Schneider had a radio show, a magazine and a book. Today, he travels around the United States, leading workshops and helping others. Schneider found his sweet spot by combining his knowledge of chickens and his passion for teaching. But he also found the right audience. Finding your audience is a crucial part of getting a business off the ground. You need to know whom you’re trying to connect with if you’re going to create relevant content. When you’re starting out, it’s best to try to focus on just one audience and worry about the rest later. Andy Schneider could’ve tried connecting with students or amateur farmers, but he wisely focused on a perfect audience: homeowners with an interest in raising their own chickens. His success even earned him an apt nickname – “the chicken whisperer.” Once you’ve discovered your own sweet spot, which is also your business niche, there’s just one more step before you start producing content. First, you have to create your own content tilt. This will help make your content different from all the other content that’s already out there and, hopefully, make it unique, memorable and valuable. There are several ways to go about this. Let’s say your sweet spot has led you to the business of home-office decoration. To pinpoint your content tilt, you could peruse social media platforms to see what your target audience is talking about and then figure out what new and unique perspective you might be able to add. You could also be more direct and come up with an online survey to find out what your potential customers are looking for or even ask them face-to-face. Once you’ve found your content tilt and put your business or service out into the world, you should be prepared to put your expertise to work. Your unique content should attract people who are interested in what you have to offer. And your knowledge and skill should make you a go-to person for information, thus growing your audience and helping you achieve expert status. But, for this to happen, you need to do three things: focus on your niche, highlight the special knowledge and skills that you can offer and let your target audience know what they can expect. The last item is something you can write down and share with your audience in the form of a mission statement. For example, Darren Rowse, the founder of the Digital Photography School, has a clear mission statement on his website, where he also offers amateur photographers some simple tips to get the most out of their cameras. Rowse’s content attracted visitors and had them coming back for more. Eventually, he became an in-demand resource for his niche audience of digital-photography enthusiasts. The right kind of content should attract customers like bees to pollen, but for your target audience to find that content, you need the right platform. Your choice of platform should be a channel that is perfectly suited for your target audience, one that makes it easy for them to connect with your content. So, what is the right channel for your audience? A blog, a podcast? Or maybe a YouTube channel, a WordPress website or a printed magazine? These are the questions you need to ask yourself. Matthew Patrick found the right platform for his audience in YouTube and has since become a famous internet personality with a series called Game Theory. Before that, he was a struggling out-of-work actor with a background in neuroscience. Patrick had a sweet spot – science, acting and a passion for gaming. So, he decided to combine these things and make a video series on YouTube to prove to the entertainment industry that he could find and hold on an audience. And it worked: he quickly had a regular and loyal following of young gaming fanatics. Once you have the right platforms in place, you’ll need a content calendar to keep your channel active. It can be overwhelming to keep your audience hooked, so a content calendar will help you stay organized and on track to deliver creative content over a long-term period. You can also keep track of your goals on the calendar by writing down the desired outcome for every piece of content and giving yourself a date to check back in and see if you’ve hit the mark. For example, you might want to see if your content got the right amount of positive feedback, or if it increased sales over a certain period of time. By keeping track of such things, you’ll be able to learn and adjust. Once you’ve found the best way to reach your target audience, the next goal should be to turn that audience into loyal subscribers. There are many ways for you to contact your target audience, including through social-media sites like Facebook and Twitter, but the best method is via email. Email subscribers are more important than social media followers; in fact, if you were to create a list of the most important people in your audience, they would be at the very top. For this top-tier audience, you’re not just another person in their feed or business competing for their attention. With email you get total control of the content they receive and the ability to reach out to them whenever you want. For example, you could send them a daily newsletter that highlights your original content or a weekly newsletter that also includes information about exciting trends in your industry. Another way to build a loyal audience is to make sure your content can be found by someone who’s looking for it. Among the different ways to do this is to practice good search engine optimization (SEO). Using good SEO techniques will increase the chances of your content getting picked up by search engines and thereby attracting more people. Without it, a search engine won’t know to include your content about home-office decoration when someone does a search on the topic. Essentially, good SEO means remembering to tag your content with helpful keywords, like “home-office decoration” and “useful tips,” and formatting your content to highlight what it’s about. You can also include relevant links to other websites to help raise your search engine profile. A final way to increase your audience is to work alongside influencers. Bloggers or media sites that already have an audience that naturally overlaps with the group you are trying to attract are perfect influencers. They can help you get more email subscribers by posting content that mentions your website or includes links to your content. Another key to making the most of your content is diversification. The goal is to position yourself as an industry leader, who offers his audience more than just one blog or YouTube channel. So, the first option for diversifying is to simply add different channels. But remember, you should only expand to another channel once your first channel has secured a loyal audience. Many successful entrepreneurs offer content digitally, in print and in person by running a blog, writing books and offering public speaking engagements. So, covering two or all three of these channels could serve as a good goal to reach. If you want to keep things purely digital, another successful way to diversify is to simply add more channels to your current platform. For example, creating a podcast is currently a very trendy way to diversify your content stream. And, to return to the Digital Photography School, Rowse diversified his website by adding a page called Snappin Deals, which highlights sales on photography equipment. Simple moves like this can really help you come across as an industry leader to your audience. A third way to diversify is to buy a content asset. These are content providers who already have a platform as well as an audience in the area you’re looking to expand to. If you want to expand quickly, it makes sense to buy an existing asset and absorb their existing audience, rather than building a new one from the ground up. This is what the photography supply store Adorama did. They purchased the magazine JPG when it was about to go out of business; since the magazine had 300,000 subscribers, this diversification deal was a tremendous boost to their audience. At this point you might be thinking, this is all well and good, but how do I turn these helpful tips into money? While any good business needs to patiently research and find out exactly what their audience wants and needs, there are ways to bring in money from the very start. Once you’re up and running you can experiment with different revenue streams to figure out what works. Game Theory’s Matthew Patrick, for example, was able to immediately generate an income by using ads on his YouTube channel. Over at the Digital Photography School, Rowse used an affiliate-marketing approach to generate income. This method directs Rowse’s audience to the websites of partners who then pay the Digital Photography School for the amount of traffic that is generated through their links. As you get going, you’ll find ever more ways to make money from your content. While most people have one or maybe two sources of income, a successful entrepreneurs has a veritable nexus of income streams. And this is the model you should aim for as well. So, always be on the lookout for additional ways to monetize your content, whether it’s through selling content to advertisers or news outlets, or generating income through magazine or podcast subscription fees. You could also look to crowdfunding sites like Kickstarter or cross-media offers like hosting a webinar or taking part in someone else’s podcast. The most important thing to remember is to keep your eyes open, as new and unexpected ways to make money are constantly popping up. And don’t forget to listen to your audience. Opportunities can come from customer feedback or from someone who heard you speak at an event. As you can see, there are plenty of ways to experiment with earning revenue right from the start. And as your audience grows and you continue to diversify and expand, those opportunities will only become more plentiful and lucrative. The key message in this book: The potential payoff from content management can be huge. It takes time to build a loyal audience, but with the right tools, a good strategy and the right kind of content, you can pull it off. And once you do, you’ll have the asset that all businesses need: a loyal audience.  Actionable advice Use the Google Trends tool to help you find your content niche.

On the other, they have to make sure that they’re staying profitable – and they feel like they can’t take any risks. As the current president of both Pixar and Disney Animation Studios, and co-founder of Pixar Studios, author Ed Catmull has lived this dilemma all of his life. Nevertheless, he succeeded in fulfilling his lifetime dream of creating the first-ever computer-animated movie, turning Pixar into an extremely successful company while saving Disney Animation Studio from its decline. So what’s the secret to Catmull’s success? Creativity, Inc. lays it all out on the table, using anecdotes from the author’s own career at Pixar and Disney, and offering insights into avoiding the common traps managers fall into that stifle creativity. All the while, these blinks will show you how to ensure that your team lives up to their full creative potential and achieve true excellence. In addition, you’ll learn why it’s better to have a great team than a great idea, why you should throw your long-term business plan in the garbage, how being able to stop an assembly line can increase productivity and how to foster creativity just by buying a new table. Would you ever ring up your boss with your ideas about how you think the business could be improved? Probably not. Most likely, you – like most people – would feel too scared or unimportant to talk to the head honcho.  Yet, this paralyzing fear can have consequences for the business: if the right people aren’t aware of problems that need fixing, they remain unfixed. So how can you get around this? You can start by creating feedback systems that allow information to be shared freely and openly between hierarchies. Animation company Pixar, for example, held a “Notes Day” in 2013, when the company halted all operations and the entire staff spent the day working with each other in teams and giving their feedback about the company. Notes Day was invaluable for the company, as staff members felt free to engage in an open dialogue about the issues they faced, meaning that problems were shared and solved. But you don’t just want any feedback. In order to get the best feedback from staff, leaders should ensure that their employees take ownership of their work. For example, Japanese companies in the 1940s were able to improve their productivity with a simple idea: rather than giving only senior managers the power to stop the factory assembly line, all workers could halt production by simply pulling a cord if they saw there was a problem. Workers thus felt pride when they fixed problems on their own rather than waiting on management’s solution. This also boosted efficiency as it led to fast problem solving. Finally, workers should feel that their opinions and suggestions are actually valued. Unfortunately, they’re often afraid to voice their opinions because they believe management will simply ignore them, or worse, treat them with disdain. That’s why Ed Catmull, co-founder of Pixar, visits all his employees individually in order to hear and gain insight about their opinions and problems, thus ensuring that they feel confident to speak to him with their opinions. Have you ever seen what happens when a new computer system is introduced in an office? People are reluctant to use it, and when they finally do, they’ll gripe and moan about how much better the old system was. Why do people behave this way? People dislike change because they feel that new, unfamiliar things will cause them to make more mistakes. What’s more, we hate making mistakes because we fear we’ll look like a failure. That’s why a guitar teacher, for instance, will never tell his students to play a new song perfectly on their first try. Not only is it impossible, but our natural response is to fear failure, and we might give up before playing the first note. Teachers expect their students to make mistakes, since trying new things always leads to errors. This attitude is just as important in business: you should ensure that people don’t feel burdened by the fear of failure so they’ll have the confidence to try new things. Our fear of the “new” can also cause us to try to carefully control the future. We see this in business, where companies choose to follow a “safe route,” creating rigid plans in order to cope with an uncertain future. Yet, inflexibility can mean that companies miss out on unexpected opportunities. For example, after Pixar and Disney Animation Studios merged together, the head of HR at Disney came to Catmull with a detailed, two-year plan specifying their goals and staff recommendations, hoping to eliminate instability by adhering to a carefully conceived plan. But Catmull knew this was a mistake: although businesses need a goal to work towards, they cannot be constrained by them. Thus, he refused to sign off on the plan in favor of maintaining flexibility. Have you ever been in a heated argument where the other person raises a valid point, but you just can’t acknowledge it and keep on arguing anyway? Why do we behave like this? We tend to automatically prefer information that confirms our opinions, which makes us blind to possible alternatives. This was proven in the 1960s by British psychologist Peter Wason, whose experiments showed that we give preference to information that supports our views over information that undermines it, regardless of its accuracy. In other words, we all suffer from confirmation bias, and this leads to mistakes. For example, imagine you’ve come up with a great idea for where to host your next office party: on a boat! However, not everyone agrees with your wonderful idea; in fact, over the course of the day, three people come to you complaining of the dangers of mixing alcohol and water, while a single person comes to congratulate you on your brilliant idea. And yet, because of confirmation bias, you are far more likely to consider the praise from one person over the concerns of the other three. Which is fine until your drunken employees are falling overboard! Managers can avoid this trap by acknowledging that their staff might have better ideas than them. For example, during a meeting at Pixar, one of the employees made the following radical suggestion the management hadn’t considered: Normally, animators worked throughout the entire production process, but the inevitable deviations from the original plan meant that they had to frequently adapt their animations, which took a long time. However, if Pixar moved the animation work towards the end of the production, the animators could then start their work with all information they needed rather than having to constantly revise it, thus greatly reducing the hours worked per person. Managers at Pixar saw the value in this idea, and implemented it, which ultimately produced great success. Would you consider making the commitment to learning quantum physics or Chinese without any real reason to? Probably not. While we certainly all might start something out of idle interest, we’re likely to quit if it doesn’t contribute to some greater goal. So, in order for companies to operate at their best, they must have a goal to strive towards. This goal doesn’t have to be specific; it can even be something abstract, like “pursuing excellence,” where each staff member strives to be the best they can be. The Pixar founders’ “passion for excellence,” for example, had a major positive impact on their work.  The company’s employees always strive to do their very best, and thus and go the extra mile to achieve this lofty goal. For example, several serious problems arose during the production of Toy Story 2 that threatened to ruin their chances of success. But because everyone at Pixar shared the goal of achieving excellence, they worked around the clock seven days a week to resolve these problems. The result: a fantastic film that grossed over $500 million at the box office. Furthermore, employees will work harder and better surmount obstacles when they know that their work is an important part of the process. For example, during the production of Pixar’s first film, Toy Story, the production managers were looked down upon by other staff members, like technicians or artists, who felt that the production managers’ work hindered everyone else’s. Despite their tough job, these production managers knew that they were making film history with Toy Story. They were able to see the value of their role in the film’s production as essential to this significant achievement in film history, and could thus ignore their coworkers’ criticism and continue to work their very best. Many people think that success in business hinges on coming up with as many groundbreaking ideas as possible. While this certainly doesn’t hurt, there’s one far more important element to success: hiring the right people. Indeed, it’s more important to have a great team than a great idea. Ultimately, it doesn’t matter how good your idea is, how clear your goals or how airtight your plan – without the right team to get the job done, you won’t succeed. For example, almost everything you buy – from your iPhone to a five-star meal – is not the result of a single idea but the sum of many people’s cooperative efforts. They are products of the work of many creative minds, whether chefs or tech designers, coming together to share their insights and create a successful product. That’s why creating an all-star team isn’t just about hiring the most talented people but forging a team that works easily and freely together. Moreover, teams ripe with diversity – rather than homogenous groups of similarly minded people – tend to be more successful. This is because their differences allow them to compliment and inspire each other. For instance, when Catmull attended the University of Utah in the 1960s, he was part of a special program where graduate students with extremely diverse interests were able to use the facility’s computers. The students were given free rein to work on whatever they wanted without any specific goals. Having such a diverse group of intelligent and eager people working in the same environment created a highly inspirational atmosphere where students often worked on their projects long into the night, playing and experimenting with ideas. The approach was a huge success: even the predecessor of the internet was developed as part of this program! Have you ever had a boss who just couldn’t hand over control of a project to his staff? Who was always looking over your shoulder, scrutinizing everything and micromanaging your work? Well, you don’t want to be that boss. This approach to management isn’t just annoying: limiting employees’ independence can seriously hamper their creativity, not to mention their morale. A better approach would be to give them the freedom to make necessary decisions on their own. Employees are experts at what they do, and thus more apt to solve certain problems than their managers – that’s why they’re hired in the first place! Pixar offers a great example of this approach with its “Braintrust,” a group of long-term Pixar employees and film-production experts in various fields who regularly review each film during its production process. Though they can certainly make whatever comments or suggestions they want, their advice is not mandatory; the film’s director is always in charge, thus leaving the real experts in control of their project and allowing their own creative expression to flourish. But since your staff should be trusted to act independently, it’s important that each new member is smart enough to be trusted with that responsibility. You can trust smart people with genuine expertise to produce the best results and quickly fix problems that arise. Interestingly, Catmull has a rule that he only hires people who, he feels, surpass his own intelligence. He believes that they’re the only ones who will have the confidence to use their initiative creatively without needing to be supervised. In fact, on some occasions, he’s even hired people that were intelligent and talented enough to do his job! While some might be insecure about hiring people that might end up being their future replacements, Catmull has no trouble doing so, as it produces the best results. Some businesses seem to meet with more than their fair share of misfortune than others. And while there’s very little that can be done about bad luck, there are ways for businesses to ensure that such misfortune doesn’t damage them. One method is to incorporate recovery techniques into the business plan instead of trying to prevent failure altogether. Pixar does this by placing value on iterative processes, i.e., they accept that mistakes are part of the process and try to weed them out with each new iteration of their projects. Central to this philosophy is the idea that the whole team, rather than just a single individual, is responsible for failure, so everyone works together to overcome it. Catmull cites the many problems that arose during the production of Monsters Inc., the first film Pixar made without its most experienced director. In spite of this, the team kept at it, tackling the problems over and over again until they got it right. Even though it was very tedious, tiring work, they didn’t consider ending the project, and instead accepted the failures and worked to overcome them. Moreover, allowing staff to fail in the earlier stages of a project gives them the chance to learn from their mistakes and do better later, when it really counts. In fact, Pixar sees failing as an important part of the iterative process. In order to minimize the negative effects of these inevitable mistakes, they give their employees more time for exploration and correction during the development phase of filmmaking. In doing so, they can ensure that error correction and reworks are fairly inexpensive in comparison to mistakes in the actual production phase of the film. This approach makes a lot of sense from a practical standpoint: after all, nobody’s perfect, and the best way to deal with mistakes is to learn from them. Imagine walking into a grey, sterile building where every cubicle looks exactly the same and following exactly the same routine every day. Anyone would agree that an environment like this is oppressively dull, yet many companies seem oblivious to this. The architecture and interior design of your company’s workspace should inspire creativity, not boredom. In fact, changing the atmosphere can be as simple as replacing a table. Early on at Pixar, meetings were held at a long, rectangular table with place cards at each seat. This set-up created an unwanted sense of formality and hierarchy – people in the middle were involved in conversation while those at the edges felt marginalized. By simply replacing the old table with a square one and losing the place cards, everyone felt much freer to participate and voice their ideas.  Additionally, workplace design should take into account your staff members’ individuality. When Catmull first came to Disney Animation after it merged with Pixar, he was devastated by the sterile look of the offices, unable to detect a personal touch at any desk. To him, this kind of environment leads to feelings of alienation that inhibit creativity. That’s why, at Pixar, workers have control over their workspace – anyone can decorate their workspace however they want, no matter how elaborate, as an expression of their unique personality. Finally, employees shouldn’t be forced into following the same rigid routines every single day. Instead, they should be free to work according to their individual styles. One example can be found at Pixar’s Tools Department, where the technology developers and engineers work. Two days every month are “personal project days,” where employees can use all the available technology to work on any project or problem that they find personally interesting. By giving them time and resources, Pixar ensures that their employees will both remain happy and possibly even come up with some creative ideas that could benefit the company!  The key message in this book: Change, and the uncertainty and instability that accompany it, is as inevitable as it is necessary for creative environments. A company culture can only be truly creative when focus is placed on forging a functioning team, building trust and fostering an imaginative environment. Don’t make your plans too rigid. If your plan is set in stone, then you won’t have any wiggle room to adjust in case things don’t go as you predict. Vary your work station. It’s easy to become bored and disinterested at work if your workspace is dull and uninviting, so avoid this by personalizing it.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

If you’ve ever been on a call with a bank or telecom provider after they had implemented a round of cuts and outsourcing, you may well have spent hours on hold, only to finally speak with a service employee who has no idea how to help you. We’re all justifiably skeptical of companies who cut costs, but decreasing expenses and streamlining operations doesn’t have to mean lower quality products or services.  Every business, regardless of its size or customer base, can cut costs in an efficient manner – a way that leads to higher revenues and, crucially, excellent service. These blinks will show you exactly when and where to cut costs, providing an essential introduction to efficient operations for any business. In these blinks, you’ll find out how to oil the wheels of your capital cycle; just how much space every employee needs; and why there’s no use crying over sunk costs. What’s the best way to make maximum profits? The simplest answer is to boost revenue, which of course helps if you can make it happen. But there’s a better and more easily controlled method that’s all about managing expenses. It’s called costs leadership, and here’s how it works: For starters, you’ll need to focus on the two main types of costs: fixed and variable. Fixed costs are independent of the level of a company’s production, and include computers, desks, telephones and other equipment. But the term can also refer to less tangible costs, like rent or insurance. In fact, labor is often considered a fixed cost since it takes time and money to hire employees. Variable costs are dependent on the level of production, meaning that the more you consume, the more you pay. Examples of variable costs are raw materials, packaging and storage.  Now that you know the two main types of costs, you can start learning why intelligently managing them will produce lower-cost products, and therefore higher revenues, all while maintaining the same standards of quality. You could reduce costs by making sweeping cuts, but this will likely lower the quality of the goods or services you provide. For example, if you decide to save money by cutting your customer support team, you’re likely to be facing some very unhappy customers in the near future.  However, wisely cutting needless costs will both increase revenue and maintain quality. For instance, IKEA’s founder Ingvar Kamprad built his 235-store empire through simple cost-cutting mechanisms that left quality intact. One strategy was to sell unassembled furniture, which takes up less space and requires less time to manufacture. But how can you intelligently cut costs? Let’s look deeper at some specific strategies to reduce expenses while maintaining quality.  When entrepreneurs found a new business, they’re often prone to overexcitement and might end up spending money they don’t have. While this mistake is a common one, it can seriously cripple a business before it even gets off the ground.  So, it’s key to understand cost management from the start, and a good place to begin is with property.  Space is a major expense and a prime target for cost trimming. To get a sense of how much space is enough, keep in mind that the standard is eleven cubic meters per worker. If you’ve got more room than this, you’re likely spending too much money on it.  Another great way to cut space costs is through hotdesking, a means to maximize workstations by eliminating individual desks and having employees use whichever one is available. For instance, Stocks, a UK company that manufactures sewing machines, has a sales team of ten people working in a space designed for six. However, the office runs smoothly because the employees spend 60 percent of their time at outside appointments.  Alright, now that you’ve maximized your space, it’s time to cut other non-essential costs, and that means outsourcing – in other words, contracting out unessential tasks to other companies.  Any activity that’s not central to your business should be tested: if it costs more for you to do it internally than externally, it should be outsourced to someone else that can do it for cheaper.  While outsourcing work that’s already being done in-house can be more complicated because capital investments have already been made, it’s essential to do it nonetheless.  Say you realize you need to outsource your advertising, but just invested in new marketing design software. Although it may be difficult, it’s important to accept your sunk costs; the money you spent on the software is already gone, but you don’t have to keep wasting money by paying advertising staff. Do you know what the capital cycle is? Well, it’s essential knowledge for any company owner, because every business abides by it.  Here’s how it works: You begin with cash in hand, either your own or someone else’s. This money is then used to purchase capital assets and materials that the employees’ work transforms into finished products for sale. You pay your suppliers, are paid by your customers and hopefully have some money left over to repeat.  Why is this central to cost reduction? Because low costs require a rapid capital cycle and a focus on the old adage that time is money. For instance, the more money tied up in working capital like stock, the greater the costs going towards things like interest and storage. It’s therefore essential to limit the amount of time that you have stock in your possession.  One way to accomplish this is through a limited inventory. Take Wal-Mart, whose stock storage is two-and-a-half times less than the industry average, ensuring an efficient cycle.  But negotiations with customers and suppliers can also cut the cost of capital assets. For example, if you sell goods and services on credit, and it takes you 90 days to collect payment from a customer, you’re essentially losing out on any interest that the money would accrue. A better strategy is to set shorter payment periods while disciplining late payers with fines and threats of legal action.  On the other side of the coin, if your suppliers offer you credit, it might be tempting to take it. However, depending on the situation, it could make good business sense to pay up front in exchange for a lower total cost. And, of course, it’s essential to avoid paying late, because doing so will give you a bad name in the industry. Increased productivity is a great way to cut variable costs, but that means convincing your employees to get more done – and we all know this is no easy task. Luckily there’s a great strategy for boosting productivity, and it all relies on motivating your staff through your profit margins instead of their turnover; this gets you on the same side as your workers while increasing your own profits.  In most companies, the sales team is rewarded for sales they make. This structure causes employees to fixate on cutting deals and costs are often left unchained. A better strategy is to link commissions to company profits, thereby focusing your salesforce on saving money and improving the company’s bottom line.  For instance, Atrium, a London-based lighting company, more than doubled its profits by switching to a rewards system tied to gross profit. Their salespeople stopped slashing prices, and instead of coasting on an “anything to please the client” mentality, they invested in cutting extraneous costs and improving efficiency. But money isn’t enough. While a good salary is a major aspect of workplace satisfaction, a fat paycheck alone won’t guarantee that your employees work at optimum efficiency. In fact, job satisfaction is also the result of various cashless motivators, like the feeling of achievement you want your cost-cutting workers to feel.  But how can you accomplish this? One way is by simply taking note of the effort your employees are making. In fact, a mere “thank you” e-mail or staff dinner party following a major project can go a long way toward motivating your team without breaking the bank! Every growing business is sure to face the challenge of financing costs, and it’s essential to bring these under control before they start eating into your profits. Financing costs – that is, the cost of raising money – arise due to interest and other fees. It’s important to identify ways to actually obtain money at little or no cost. One strategy is to go to government agencies or certain businesses, like banks and newspapers, that might have an interest in particular business activities taking place in a specific area; this could lead them to contribute money or offer benefits to your company.  For instance, every year there are thousands of awards given out around the world to new or small businesses. The majority of these are based around a business plan like the HSBC’s Start-up Awards which grants up to £25,000. Another approach is to ask family and friends for money. This technique is beneficial because you avoid conforming to formalized and time-consuming procedures while also being afforded more flexible terms. However, it’s essential that you explain any and all risks to such funders because the last thing you want is for a helpful friend or family member to suffer economic hardship due to your failed financial commitments.  The third and final strategy is to negotiate with banks for more favorable terms. But to do so you need both the necessary know-how and a business plan. In the end, banks are subject to the same macroeconomic factors and pressure to turn a profit as you are, so it’s wise to seek out a bank that’s in good financial condition, as they’ll be able to offer you a better rate.  One way to do so is by reading the financial section of the newspaper and keeping in mind that the interest rates tend to be from three percent to nine percent. Naturally you should be shooting for the lower end of the range and should shop around until you get there. If catastrophe strikes your company, cutting costs is likely the first measure you’ll take. Sometimes this can mean making difficult decisions to keep your business afloat, and we all know that extreme times can call for extreme measures. One such strategy is trading debt for equity, because offloading debt can sometimes be worth an major chunk of your company. For instance, the luggage company Samsonite traded a whopping 60 percent of its shares to CVC Capital Partners, one of Europe’s largest private equity groups, in exchange for the payment of a debt worth nearly $175 million.  Another extreme measure is to relocate your business to a new country to save on taxes. For example, certain countries have very low business tax rates, like the Maldives with a tax rate of nine percent and the United Arab Emirates with one of 15 percent. Compare that to countries with some of the highest rates, like Italy where the business tax rate is 76 percent or India where it’s 86 percent.  But no matter what action you take in a crisis, firing your employees is never the smartest option; businesses with insecure staff fare far worse.  Why? Well, being fired is the main source of fear for any employee, affecting both their productivity and the quality of their work. In fact, firing people can even cause valuable employees to look for ways out of a company they view as a sinking ship. However, employees are also willing to make sacrifices that save the company money, if doing so will guarantee them a job. For instance, in June 2009, British Airways convinced 6,940 employees to take voluntary unpaid leave – a move that saved the company $16.7 million as well as the long-term jobs of those workers.  And, of course, there’s the measure of last resort: cut and run. After all, failure is just a fact of business, and in the United Kingdom alone, 400,000 businesses close their doors every year! So remember, getting out of an unprofitable business, if done well, can leave you in better shape to start another.  The key message in this book: Some people view cost-cutting as an emergency measure, but a long-term expense-reduction strategy is actually essential to boosting the profit margins of any company. Managing your costs effectively will also help you build a business that is prepared to face any crisis or difficult situation.  Actionable advice: Apply zero-base budgets. Generally the first thing a company does when drafting its annual budget is determine how much money each department will need for the year. So, if you spent $60,000 on marketing last year to produce $4 million in sales, it might seem logical to spend $90,000 this year for a sales target of $6 million.  However, zero-base budgeting doesn’t assume that last year’s money was spent intelligently and efficiently. Rather, it assumes that every year, each department of your company should start from scratch and present arguments for every dime you allocate.

Should you prove yourself by demonstrating your power over subordinates? Would you command more respect if you changed your job title? In fact, if you want to become a better leader you’ll need to forget all about status, titles and power plays. Instead, get ready to engage your heart and mind as you go on a journey to discover how the most courageous leaders think, feel and behave. You’ll look at what concepts such as trust, honesty and failure can tell you about daring leadership, and challenge conventional wisdom about how the most successful among us operate. You’ll also discover the impact of your values, emotions and interpersonal relationships on your effectiveness as a leader. Finally, you’ll learn why, in a competitive and hostile working culture, you nonetheless need to let yourselves be vulnerable if you want to get ahead. In these blinks, you’ll discover what skydiving can teach you about leadership skills; why vulnerability leads to innovation; and why bravery and perfectionism don’t mix. What makes you feel vulnerable? The author has posed this question to thousands of individuals over the years, garnering responses that will probably sound familiar. Vulnerability is the first date after your difficult divorce, starting to run your first business or how you feel when you get laid off from work. In fact, vulnerability is a universal human emotion that we feel when we expose ourselves to others and during times of risk or uncertainty. Nonetheless, despite being such a common feeling, there are some damaging myths surrounding vulnerability, particularly that it equals weakness. Experiences that make you feel vulnerable, like losing a job or putting yourself out there emotionally, can bring feelings of anxiety, uncertainty and a desire for self-protection. However, there is not a single piece of empirical data to suggest that vulnerability is associated with weakness. In fact, the opposite is true: acts of courage are impossible without first putting yourself in a vulnerable position. Not convinced? Just consider the question that the author put to a room of special forces military personnel in 2014. After explaining that vulnerability is the emotion that accompanies risk and uncertainty, the author then asked these brave, tough soldiers whether any of them had ever undertaken or witnessed a courageous act that did not require them to feel vulnerable. Unsurprisingly, none of the soldiers could come up with a single example of courageousness in which vulnerability hadn’t come along for the ride. In other words, as soon as the audience focused on their actual experiences of being courageous, the myth of vulnerability and weakness crumbled. And vulnerability isn’t just essential to courage. In fact, it is the cornerstone of human innovation and creativity. Why? Because there is so much uncertainty inherent to the creative process that successful innovation usually requires a healthy dose of failure along the way. On a cultural level, this means that a society that equates vulnerability with weakness is likely to struggle to produce new ideas or fresh perspectives - although some individuals will inevitably go against the grain. As Golden Globe-winning actress and writer Amy Poehler points out, it’s very difficult to let yourself be vulnerable, and those who can are often society’s dreamers, thinkers and creators. Sometimes, the truth hurts. In the early days of starting her own company, the author’s employees asked if they could sit down with her and discuss some concerns they had. Stunned, the author listened as her employees relayed how bad they thought she was at time management and pointed out her habit of setting unrealistic deadlines that they often struggled to meet. Although their criticisms were hard to hear, the author was grateful for her team’s honest feedback. Why? Because she believes that being clear is being kind, and that it’s unkind to be unclear. Indeed, entering into all communication with a spirit of clarity and honesty, both at home and in the workplace, is a simple yet transformative step that all leaders should take. Unfortunately, research has shown that the majority of us sidestep clarity in our daily interactions because we feel it's kinder to do so. But is it really? We may tell ourselves that we feed people half-truths to make them feel good, but often we’re really avoiding honest and confrontational conversations because they make us uncomfortable. Clear communication would be far kinder and more productive in the long run. After all, if you fail to be clear about your expectations for a subordinate simply because doing so is difficult, you’ll likely just end up blaming them for failing to deliver further down the line. One of the most important things the author has learned from years of studying leadership is that leaders need to spend a significant amount of time communicating about their subordinates’ feelings and fears. If they fail to do this, they can expect to spend even more time attempting to manage their workforce’s unproductive and ineffective behavior. Importantly, leaders can solicit clearer feedback from subordinates by really listening to them. Once you ask someone about their true feelings, leave a lot of empty space and drawn-out pauses in the conversation. In other words, try to stop talking. This may feel uncomfortable, but have faith that, when they’re ready, the other person will fill the silences with their true thoughts. When they do begin talking, try not to start mentally formulating a response right away. Instead, concentrate on listening to their concerns. Just remember that they are being kind enough to be clear with you – return the favor by really listening to them. The modern workplace can often feel like a gladiatorial arena – a battle for supremacy that, while not a matter of life and death, still requires bravery and plenty of blood, sweat and tears. During moments of struggle, whether at work or in our personal lives, it’s tempting to throw up our hands and exit the arena. How can we find the strength to keep going? Importantly, when we find ourselves face down in the dirt, it’s our values that motivate us to get back up again and keep daring to give it our all. Our values inform our judgments about what is most important in our lives. The most courageous leaders that the author came across during her research were those who had the most clarity about what their values were. During times of uncertainty and vulnerability, their values were an important support to them, a ‘North Star’ that helped guide them through periods of darkness. They were more willing to take risks, secure in the knowledge that their values would guide them through without compromising their integrity. Knowing what was most important to them was vital to their ability to be daring leaders. So take the time to ask yourself: What are your key values? Making a list of things that are highly important to us might be a straightforward exercise. When we whittle our list down to just two things, though, it really becomes useful. The author, for example, narrowed hers down to the key values of courage and faith. Why two? The author’s research, derived from hundreds of interviews with global executive leaders, has found that most leaders identify ten or more core values. The leaders most willing to experience vulnerability and demonstrate courage, on the other hand, anchored themselves to no more than two. It makes a lot of sense - two values are actionable. But if every single value on the less daring leaders’ long lists is highly important to them, then none are truly driving their behavior. Consequently, their values become a meaningless list of words that make them feel good. To avoid falling into the same trap, we can name our two most important values, let them guide our behavior and hold them close when times get tough. How trustworthy are we, and how many people do we truly trust? Astonishingly, most people report that they themselves are entirely trustworthy, but that they trust only a small number of other colleagues. It seems that most of us have some trust issues to work on. First, though, we need to ask ourselves: What does the concept of trust actually mean? The author’s team of researchers has pinpointed seven separate behaviors that encourage trust, expressed together with the acronym BRAVING. BRAVING can be a useful way to inventory strengths and areas for improvement in working relationships with subordinates. So, what are these behaviors? The B stands for boundaries. This element of trust involves respecting others’ boundaries. If either party is unsure of the other’s boundaries, they ask whether or not something is okay, and the other person feels comfortable enough to say no if it isn’t. The R stands for reliability, or doing what we say we will. In a work context, this translates into being aware of our abilities and limitations so that we don’t end up overpromising and under-delivering on commitments. The A stands for accountability. We take ownership of our mistakes, apologize for them and try our best to make amends. The V stands for vault. We can think of ourselves as a vault of information that other people have shared with us over time. An important aspect of trust is not passing on information that is not ours to pass on. Other people need to trust that we will keep their confidences and also need to see that we are not sharing other’s confidential information with them. The I stands for integrity - choosing courage instead of comfort, and doing what is right rather than what is easy, fun or expedient. It also means practicing the same values that we preach. The N stands for non-judgment, which means people know that they can tell us how they really feel or ask for help without expecting us to judge them for doing so. The G stands for generosity, being consistently generous in our interpretation of the words, actions and intentions of others. People are more likely to trust us if they know we always see the best in others, rather than the worst. Implement these behaviors to become a successful, trustworthy leader. Believe it or not, business leaders could learn a lot from skydivers. Before aspiring skydivers are allowed to hit the skies, they spend numerous training sessions learning how to hit the ground safely by simply jumping off ladders. The lesson for leaders? If you’re going to be brave, then it’s best to prepare yourself for bumpy landings. In other words, you need to learn how to be resilient. Unsurprisingly, things are done differently in business than in skydiving. Leaders and leadership coaches are usually aware of the need for resilience training, but these skills are usually taught only after a failure or crisis has already happened. It’s comparable to teaching newbie skydivers the right way to hit the ground after they’ve already landed, or worse, when they’re already in free-fall. But there is a better way. Research has shown that when it comes to teaching leaders resilience skills, timing is everything. Specifically, teaching them early on as part of a wider training program is more likely to result in them demonstrating courageous behaviors. Why? Quite simply, they are confident in their ability to get back up again if their daring behavior doesn’t pay off. So companies that fail to instill these resilience skills in their workforce are effectively deterring their leaders, both present and future, from bravery. Some organizations may worry that teaching leaders how to fail from the get-go promotes a culture of low expectations. In fact, the opposite is true. For instance, in the author’s own company she makes it a priority to teach failing and resilience skills as part of the onboarding process for new recruits. It’s the company’s way of telling new joiners that bravery is expected, thus failure is also expected once in a while. Interestingly, this emphasis on resilience is nothing new. You may well have seen company slogans urging you to “fall forward” and “fail fast!” But without a resilience skills program to back them up, implemented at an early stage in a leader’s development, these slogans can do more harm than good. Why? Because leaders who fail without the resilience skills to cope quickly find themselves dealing with a double dose of shame – the shame of the initial failure quickly followed by the shame of struggling to pick themselves up again despite all the shouty motivational slogans urging them to learn and move on. Right from childhood, we seek to shield ourselves from vulnerable feelings like disappointment, hurt and diminishment. By building a wall out of our behaviors, emotions and thoughts, we protect ourselves from the big bad world. But to live and lead with courage, as we already know, we must let ourselves be vulnerable. This means letting down our walls and recognizing protective thoughts and behaviors for the defense mechanisms they really are. One of the most pervasive types of self-protection is perfectionism. To become daring leaders, we must rid ourselves of perfectionism. To do so, let’s start by busting some of the myths around this damaging phenomenon. Perhaps the most damaging myth of all is that perfectionism is about self-improvement and striving for excellence. But in fact, perfectionism is really about attempting to win approval. Most perfectionists are raised in environments that praise their exceptional performance, for example in athletics or school. As a result, perfectionists develop a damaging belief system that follows them into their adult lives, anchoring their whole sense of self in accomplishments and brilliant execution. This locks perfectionists into an exhausting behavioral pattern of pleasing people, perfecting efforts, performing for others and proving themselves. People with a healthy drive for success, on the other hand, are much more self-focused and inspired by asking themselves how they can improve. It’s a stark contrast with perfectionists, who ask ‘what might others think of me?’ Significantly, leaders who armor themselves with perfectionism often assume that this way of thinking will bring them success. They couldn’t be more wrong because there is a much darker side to perfectionism, going way beyond the need to please. Disturbingly, research shows that perfectionism is associated with addiction, depression and anxiety. Furthermore, perfectionists are more likely to miss opportunities and experience mental paralysis that keeps them from fully engaging in life. Why? Because their fears of being criticized or not meeting the expectations of others keeps them from entering the messy arena of life, where healthy competition and striving for true greatness occur. To become a daring leader, take off the armor of perfectionism and jump into the fray of life. You might make mistakes in the process, but you’ll gain something valuable in exchange: the courage to succeed and lead. The key message in these blinks: When we open ourselves up to vulnerability, we open ourselves up to courage and creativity. When we let go of our perfectionist tendencies and our fear of failure, we find the bravery to improve ourselves and to have difficult, important conversations with our colleagues. In other words, we need all of our emotions on board if we’re going to become daring leaders.  Actionable advice: Explore your feelings instead of numbing them. Our knee-jerk response when experiencing vulnerability is often to try to make it go away. We usually numb ourselves, with whatever we have at hand - whether it’s alcohol, comfort eating or shopping. But before you dive into that big glass of wine or tub of ice cream, ask yourself: What is it I’m actually feeling, and where has this feeling come from? Once you’ve identified the real problem, you can work out what will bring you real comfort and relief from it. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Doing business across borders is simpler than ever before, and the internet provides everyone with easy access to the tools they need to go it alone as a solo entrepreneur. In short, it’s a golden age for startups. But most young companies still fall at the first hurdle. So what’s going on? Well, here’s the thing: even if you have the greatest idea in the world, you’ll still go bust if you’re not applying a couple of basic business rules. In the end, it’s the simplest – and most common – pitfalls that snuff out so many startups. That means it’s not a bad idea to make like a greenhorn and seek the advice of a grizzled veteran or two when you first arrive on the frontlines. And that’s exactly who you’ll be meeting in these blinks: savvy business minds who’ve seen it all and know the startup scene like the back of their own hands. However, their essential field manual for founders isn’t just a survival guide. Start putting their tips into practice, and you’ll be well on your way to thriving in one of the most exciting industries in existence. In these blinks, you’ll learn why you should seek out investors who bring more to the table than just cash; how to kick the micromanaging habit; and why hiring people is like giving away Super Bowl tickets. If you’re reading these blinks, chances are you’re thinking of going it alone and starting your own business – but have you asked yourself, why? Is it because it’s the thing to do these days, or are you just in it for a quick buck? If you’re not sure, it’s time to ponder some key questions and a couple of sobering facts! First things first: a lot of startups fail. That’s statistically proven, but it also makes intuitive sense. After all, there’s only so much money, attention and support to go around. A couple of startups enjoy meteoric success – just think of Google or Facebook – while the rest fight for crumbs. That’s not supposed to deter you, but it is important that you keep it in mind. If you’re going to make it, you’ll need to be extremely hardworking and make smart decisions. Still game? Great, now’s the time to answer that all-important question and clarify your aims. Whether you want to make a ton of cash or change the world, having a clear idea of your goal will see you through tough times. You’ll also want to make sure you’re firmly committed to your project before jumping in. Remember, adversity is virtually guaranteed. Success is all about sticking to your guns, even when the situation looks all but hopeless. That said, you should put a couple of numbers to that commitment so that you know when to hit the eject button. You might, for example, say that you’re willing to put $200,000 of your own cash into your startup and that you’re going to stick it out for a year. If you realize there’s little to no chance of your making it after 12 months, it’s probably a good idea to quit before you end up throwing good money after the bad. And here’s the final thing you’ll need to keep in mind: although you’ll be dependant on your own resources, you’re much more likely to come out on top if you have the support of others. That’s why it’s so important to make sure your friends and family are on board with your project and understand the risks. Your life is going to be hectic, unpredictable and full of long shifts – you don’t want that to cause grief in your relationships! Fundraising is vital, but it’s a hard slog. At times, it’ll seem pointless and leave you feeling like Don Quixote – the mad Spanish knight who charges down windmills he’s mistaken for giants in Cervantes’ eponymous novel. But here’s the thing: if you’re struggling to make headway, it might just be because you’ve forgotten a couple of basic fundraising rules. The key to raising money is finding the right contacts. That means you need to be discerning when it comes to putting together a list of potential investors. So what does that look like in practice? Well, a good start is to make sure you’re targeting people who know your industry. If you’re launching a pharmaceutical product, for example, you don’t want to be calling investors who specialize in the music industry. That’s because you don’t just want money – you also want people who can support your business with advice, experience and access to their network. The best investors open doors for you, so focus on finding a small number of genuine industry experts, rather than hitting up anyone with a checkbook. Chances are, things will move much more quickly that way. Right, so you know who you’re aiming to get on board – now you’ll need to make sure you’re maximizing your chances of convincing them. That all comes down to two things: sound planning and excellent listening skills. Let’s start with planning. Proper preparation is essential when you’re fundraising. You’ll want to turn up to meetings with a clear idea of where you’re at right now and where the money you’re asking for will get you. Ideally, you’ll be doing this far enough in advance so that you’re not making your pitch when you’re already desperate for funding. It’s also a good idea to ask for an amount that fits with your startup’s stage of development. If it’s still early days, for example, you’re probably best off keeping your request modest. Finally, you’ll want to make sure you’re listening to investors even when they turn you down. So if the tenth potential investor in a row tells you your project doesn’t seem to be fully fledged, you’ll want to take some time out from fundraising to consolidate your business plan. As an entrepreneur, it’s natural that you’re protective about your business – after all, it’s your baby. That’s sometimes a problem, though; like an overprotective parent, the urge to micromanage every little detail can be irresistible. But that’s ultimately counterproductive. Running everything yourself won’t just stress you out – it might even kill your beloved company. Luckily, there are plenty of simple tools you can use to increase your employees’ efficiency without constantly hovering over them. The key is to create a company culture that encourages excellence. That’s all about communicating your goals clearly and motivating people to accomplish them by rewarding achievement. And remember to be generous; if your team completes 80 percent of what it set out to do, chalk it up as a triumph. A great company culture is also proactive about solving problems. Here, you’ll have to lead by example. Encourage people to come to you with their problems, and earn their trust by going out of your way to resolve them. Ideally, you’ll be assessing the relevance of the issue the same day it’s been brought up and taking steps to solve it within 24 hours. Put those two policies into place, and you can be sure your employees will become increasingly self-reliant, freeing your time up for other important tasks. And here’s the good news: when your workers show initiative and autonomy, your company is much more likely to prosper. That’s something author Maynard Webb learned firsthand while working with clients like Yahoo and eBay. Take just one striking example from his time as a manager at eBay. Webb’s team was dealing with a massive logistical headache. Users’ sales adverts were flooding in at such a volume that the company’s infrastructure simply couldn’t keep up. It was taking 24 hours before new posts were properly indexed and appearing online. Customers who were paying premium rates for greater visibility were naturally furious about this logjam. Normally, it would’ve taken up to 18 months to resolve such a serious technical hitch. Webb’s team, however, were used to working self-reliantly by this point. It was, after all, a vital aspect of the company culture he had cultivated at eBay. As a result, they set about resolving the issue themselves without passing it up the hierarchy. Within six months, they’d created a brand new indexing process, and the bug was fixed! Webb knows all about how hard delegating tasks can be. Take the case of one his managers. He was getting great operational results from his team, and the sales figures looked great – but the people under him were constantly criticizing his tendency to micromanage employees. The manager was exhausted, and the team was frustrated by its members’ lack of autonomy. In the end, the manager decided to stop micromanaging. When the author later asked him how his project was doing, he told him that he didn’t know. He’d delegated the task to his team and washed his hands of the matter. Needless to say, that isn’t exactly a shining example of great delegation!   So what does effective delegation look like? Well, the most important thing is getting the balance between managerial oversight and responsibility right. You want to make sure your project is being executed correctly without constantly stepping on your employees’ toes. To do that, you’ll need to decide which team members are most capable and willing to complete essential tasks, and you’ll need to communicate your goals clearly. The second step is to make sure that you’re regularly checking in to see how things are going and that you’re rewarding good work. Easier said than done, right? Not quite – in fact, there’s a simple tool you can start using today to help you effectively delegate work. It’s called the RACI Model. Here’s how it works. When you’re delegating tasks, you’ll want to ask yourself four questions. First off, who is Responsible? Here you’ll be identifying the person you’ll be putting in charge of making calls. Ideally, he’ll be as far down the hierarchy as possible – otherwise, you’ll end up micromanaging him! Next, who Approves? This is the person who’ll have veto powers over the team member you’ve made responsible. Typically, this is the delegator – that is, you. Third, who is Consulted? This is about identifying people who have no final say in the project, but whose input is vital to its success. Finally, ask yourself, who is Informed? These are basically stakeholders: people interested in, and affected by, the decisions that will be made. Remember, when in doubt, it’s always better to tell more people, rather than fewer. When Webb was interviewed for his first job, a position at IBM, he was asked how he’d feel about firing someone. Webb replied that he reckoned he’d be able to do it but couldn’t imagine it ever being necessary. The interviewer laughed out loud. Webb would soon understand why. There’s no getting around it: some people just aren’t cut out for their jobs. Ask the average manager how many employees he’d hire again after having seen them in action for a couple of years, and he’ll likely tell you that 80 percent of his calls were correct. That leaves the 20 percent: serial underperformers you’d be better off replacing.   Established companies have a bit of leeway when it comes to mediocre workers – they’re usually large enough to carry a bit of dead weight. That’s not true of startups, however. Faced with smaller budgets and limited resources, they simply can’t afford to spend a cent on anyone who’s not pulling their weight. That’s why it’s so important to act swiftly and decisively when there’s no alternative to letting someone go. Unfortunately, lots of managers hesitate when faced with making such a dramatic call. That’s an issue. Have you heard the saying that a bad apple spoils the barrel? Well, underachievers have just that effect, undermining the morale of high performers who resent having to cover for someone who isn’t doing his fair share.   Acting quickly avoids all that trouble. You might even be able to save the employee: a well-timed, supportive intervention sometimes gets him back on track. If that’s not possible, however, you’ll have to reach for the metaphorical axe and give him the chop. The best policy, though, is to prevent that uncomfortable situation from arising in the first place by taking your time when it comes to hiring. Think of taking new people on as giving away a limited number of tickets to the Super Bowl – you’d really want to think about who deserves them, right? So if two applicants are pretty much evenly matched on paper, take into account their intangible qualities, like a willingness to go above and beyond the call of duty and provide excellent customer service. Stress lurks around every corner when you’re an entrepreneur. Take it from Webb. He remembers getting up one morning at 5:00 a.m. because he had a two-hour drive ahead of him to get to an 8:00 a.m. meeting in San Francisco. Before heading out, he sat down to quickly shoot off a couple of emails. When he fired up his laptop, however, disaster struck: he couldn’t log in to his account, even though he was using the correct password. Reloading the page didn’t help, either. To top it all off, Webb had a nasty bout of the flu and was feeling awful. It was the worst possible start to an already pretty intense day. It’s in moments like these that you’ll have to take a step back. Sometimes, all it takes is a moment of calm to make things look a whole lot better. Webb took a couple of deep breaths and thought about his situation. He rebooted his laptop and found that the problem had been resolved. These sorts of stressful situations are pretty commonplace when you’re a startup founder. The key is to remind yourself that the situation is temporary; no matter how bad things look right now, they will improve – especially if you put your mind to solving them. Remember, panicking only makes things worse. It’s when you’re in headless-chicken mode that you really start falling behind. What you need to do when you find yourself in a jam is follow this simple, four-step plan: slow your pace, figure out the immediate cause of the crisis, come up with a solution and, finally, proactively implement it. To do that, you’ll need to put some distance between yourself and your operational work so you can really look at the issue in detail. It’s also a good idea to give a moment of thought to anticipating problems that might interfere with important tasks. Next, make a list of priorities, and work through them in order. Finally, give yourself ample time to complete these tasks so you don’t find yourself scrambling to hurry them across the finish line at the last minute. A couple of years back, Yahoo began developing a flight search tool called Hipmunk. The project looked set to become a success until Google dropped a bombshell: it was working on its own competing service. It was a blow for Yahoo. No wonder: competition, especially from a giant like Google, always makes fundraising a lot tougher. But that kind of challenge doesn’t just frighten managers and employees; it also tends to scare investors. In fact, it’s usually when they ask you if you’re worried that you know you’d better start worrying! So what can you do when a rival moves onto your turf? Well, the place to start is by reassuring your backers. That’s because there’s a real risk of a snowball effect: losing just one investor can spook others, eventually leading to a mass exodus. The second bit of advice is to stay calm yourself and try to wait it out. Hold back while you figure out just how big the threat is, and don’t worry too much if you’re raising less money during this period of insecurity. If keeping your cool sounds all well and good in theory, but hard to put into practice when you’re looking down the barrel of a crisis, just remember this: At the time of writing, Yahoo’s Hipmunk still ranks ahead of Google Flights on the product recommendation website Slant! And here’s another thing to keep in mind when you’re anxiously surveying your rivals: competition isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Take an example from the travel industry. When Google decided it was going to enter the market, existing companies like Expedia and Priceline banded together to retain their position. They teamed up with Hipmunk and put their own financial might and expertise at the latter’s disposal, transforming an inexperienced new kid on the block into a powerful agent capable of blocking the Silicon Valley giant’s takeover bid. That would never have happened if Google hadn’t announced itself as a competitor! Imagine a bomb scare on a subway system. The authorities have to react, but they also need to make sure they’re reacting in the right way. In other words, the best thing they can do is make sure they’ve assessed the situation correctly. That’s also true in business. If you find yourself in a crisis, the most important step is analytical: determining whether the crisis is real and, if it is, finding out just how bad it is. To do that, you have to make use of a key managerial skill: listening. After all, it’s usually your employees who’ll first notice something’s wrong. If you want to anticipate issues, you’d better keep your ear close to the ground! Once you’ve heard that ominous rumble in the distance, you’ll need to put a system in place that allows  you to understand how grave the threat actually is. When Webb was at eBay, for example, he used a scale ranging from one to nine, like the Richter scale used to measure earthquakes. Small, low-priority niggles ranked lowest; large-scale problems that could undermine the whole company ranked highest. In practice, that meant an eBay user who couldn’t access the site due to a bug on their computer would rank as a one. It wasn’t a serious matter and, in any case, the company couldn’t do much to fix it. The eBay backup program failing to run during a power outage, however, was a code-red, level-nine kind of issue. So what do you do when you’re faced with those kinds of crises? Well, you only really have one option: sound the alarm, summon all hands on deck, and try to resolve it as quickly as possible. If you want to know why speed is so vital, just think of the popular saying about frogs and boiling water: put the amphibian in a pot of scalding water, and it’ll jump right out – but put it a vat of lukewarm water and slowly bring it to a boil, and it will stay in the water until it’s too late! For a real-world example of a company not waiting around for the water to come to a boil, look to the electric car manufacturer Tesla. In 2015, the company discovered a potential security problem related to their seatbelts. Tesla immediately sprung into action, recalled all affected automobiles and got to work finding a solution. If they hadn’t, they wouldn’t have just put their customers’ lives at risk – they’d also have exposed themselves to serious legal issues. So, remember: whether you’re dealing with fundraising or delegation issues, there are always ways to up your game as a founder and steer your company toward success! The key message in these blinks: There’s no sugarcoating it: launching a startup isn’t for the faint of heart. More startups fail than succeed, and the only way of avoiding their fate is elbow grease, fanatical determination and a willingness to work impossibly long hours. That’s why it’s so important to make sure you’ve got the essentials down before you jump in. Whether it’s effective fundraising, firing underperformers or motivating your employees, these are all skills you can learn. Pair that with a can-do attitude and an ability to keep calm in the face of crises, and you’ll be set for success!  Actionable advice: Aim to be great – don’t content yourself with good.  Ask the average manager how her company is doing, and she’ll usually compare its current performance to last year’s or the competition’s. That’s not good enough; if you’re not comparing yourself to what you can become or the greatest successes in your field, you’re on course for mediocrity at best. So start setting your sights a little higher than usual. As they say, if you shoot for the moon and miss, you’ll still land among the stars. Got feedback?

In one night, the rules of American politics were torn up, and the country was left horribly divided. What went so wrong for Hillary Clinton? Wasn’t she expected to win easily? Now, for the first time, a member of Clinton’s presidential campaign gives us the inside story. We’ll learn why expectations were so confounded on election night, why the odds were stacked against her right from the very beginning, and how ambitious women can succeed where Clinton failed. In these blinks, you’ll find out Why Hillary Clinton made the media uncomfortable; What all great presidents have in common; and Why professional women are held to different standards than men. The author Jennifer Palmieri will always remember November 9, 2016, as one of the worst days of her life. That was the night that, against all expectations, Donald Trump was elected President of the United States. As director of communications for the Clinton campaign, Palmieri was horrified and in a state of disbelief. How could Trump’s hateful rhetoric have won the day? Why had Clinton, an experienced political heavyweight, lost? Palmieri now believes that sexism played a big part in the outcome of the election. Consider the media’s reaction to Clinton’s concession speech: Clinton conceded that Trump had won and stated that she would accept his presidency for the good of the American people. Many in the media confusingly said that this speech had been her campaign’s best. They even claimed that this was a side to Clinton they hadn’t seen before – a softer side that would have gone down better with voters during the contest. Palmieri believes that the media’s response to this speech demonstrates their sexist attitude toward Clinton. Why? Because she acted the same way she did throughout her campaign – the one difference being that she was graciously accepting that a man had defeated her. The media only liked her concession speech better because it was more in line with their expectations about how women should behave. This incident demonstrates that society is more comfortable when women concede to men for the greater good. We view women less favorably when they display ambition like Clinton did when she sought the presidency. As part of Clinton’s communications team, Palmieri already knew about society’s problems with ambitious women. During the early phases of her campaign, experts warned Clinton that people tended to view ambitious females as selfish and pushy. To combat these perceptions, she had to ensure she always framed her presidential ambitions in the context of wanting to serve others. The author has worked in communications for both the Obama and Bill Clinton administrations. In this role, she found herself in some very important rooms. She’s attended meetings at 10 Downing Street, the German Chancellor’s office and the Kremlin. But it's what she learned in the Oval Office that prepared her the most for how to conduct herself in these halls of power. Her experiences in the White House taught her the importance of speaking her mind. During Bill Clinton’s presidency, Palmieri found she had to give her opinion or risk being sidelined during Oval Office meetings. The president’s staff meetings tended to be chaotic and fast-paced, and it was normal for attendees to talk over one another. In fact, Palmieri recalls that during eight years of attending these meetings with President Clinton, she never saw anyone finish a sentence before being interrupted – even the president himself! Therefore, she quickly learned to speak up and be assertive, or get left behind. President Obama’s approach to staff meetings may have been different, but her time with him still taught her the same thing: to share her opinions. At the end of every staff meeting, Obama would make a point of speaking to any attendee who had not yet ventured an opinion. Obama would then ask these quieter attendees – many of whom tended to be women – what they thought about the matter at hand. Later, a more senior staff member told the author that the reason Obama did this was not to be polite. He genuinely needed to know the opinion of every member of his team. This thought – that the President of the United States actually needed her advice – greatly boosted Palmieri’s confidence. Sometimes women struggle to find the confidence to speak up in important meetings. Palmieri firmly believes that if you behave as if your views matter, then other people will act as if they do too. In other words, women need to believe in the value of their opinions, and the rest will follow. By 10:00 p.m. on election night, 2016, it had become increasingly clear that Donald Trump was going to win. Palmieri found herself sitting with another female colleague on the Hillary Clinton campaign team. Together, they tried to process the devastating news. At this point, you might assume that the women shed some tears. After all, they were shocked and demoralized. But they didn’t. They just stoically nodded to each other as the news came in. Looking back, Palmieri realized that she wanted to cry that evening, but felt that she couldn’t. Why? Because she didn’t want to be the woman who cried at work. This is part of a larger problem: in professional situations, women often feel undue pressure to keep their emotions under control. For instance, Palmieri believes that people are constantly monitoring the reactions of women to difficult news. Negative stereotypes around the emotional stability of women mean they’re often observed to see whether they’re tough enough to handle problems calmly. Women sense this extra surveillance and often respond by being as stoic as possible in the workplace. But Palmieri believes that women shouldn’t be afraid to cry in the workplace. In fact, she believes that women should view crying as a feminine power-play rather than a display of weakness. During a post-election press conference at Harvard University, Palmieri found herself putting on just such an emotional display. After all the disappointment and divisive tactics used by the Trump campaign, she found herself moved to tears when finally confronted by some of his team. She cried as she called out their campaign for its racist rhetoric during the run-up to the election. Though much of the media, and some of her colleagues, criticised her show of emotion, Palmieri has no regrets. She cares deeply about the issues she cried over, and she’s not ashamed of letting the world know it. During her career in the highest echelons of politics, Palmieri has weathered a fair number of crises. She was in the White House during the impeachment of Bill Clinton, the Russian government’s leaks and hacks and the televised beheadings of ISIS. It’s common knowledge that riding out political storms such as these requires a cool head and a rational approach to problem-solving. But dealing with a crisis also requires something else: a warm heart, and knowing when to listen to it. In 2013, George Zimmerman was acquitted of shooting the unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin. The verdict caused an outpouring of grief and anger from African Americans. As President Obama’s director of communications, Palmieri immediately told him that he needed to speak to the country’s black community. The president replied that, no, what was needed was to speak for the black community. Palmieri watched as Obama prepared and delivered a poignant speech in which he empathized and identified with his fellow African Americans. Afterward, she realized one of the reasons he was such a successful leader is that, in times of crisis like these, he wasn’t afraid to follow his heart. Obama felt the pain and injustice facing black Americans and was able to share his own heartfelt emotions with them. During Clinton’s presidential campaign, Palmieri witnessed how Clinton listened to her own heart when assessing situations. Unfortunately, however, Clinton’s campaign team, including Palmieri herself, didn’t always listen to Clinton’s intuition. An example comes from Clinton’s use of a private email server for official correspondence during her time as secretary of state, which proved controversial during the election race. The public saw this as a reason to doubt her trustworthiness as a person and potential president. Clinton’s heart told her to continue addressing voters’ concerns about the email scandal, and this is what she suggested to her team. Palmieri, however, advised her not to, as this would further remind voters of the scandal. In the end, Clinton followed Palmieri’s advice. Now though, Palmieri believes that Clinton had it right all along: She should have spoken more to allay the public’s fears about her trustworthiness. Not talking about the emails created a vacuum which her opponents were more than happy to fill by offering their own take on the scandal. Perhaps if the campaign team had listened to what Clinton’s heart was telling her, the election result might have been different. The United States has seen many presidents come and go. There have been significant differences between them in their political positions, but there’s one thing they all seem to have in common: they age visibly during their presidency. In fact, it’s almost an American pastime to remark on how much older presidents look when they leave the White House. When Palmieri recently looked at photographs of Barack Obama taken during his 2008 election campaign, she thought he could have almost passed for the son of the man who left the Oval Office in 2017. Although we don’t seem to mind our male leaders visibly aging, Palmieri doubts we’d be so lenient on the changing looks of a female president. It's a well-known fact that women are judged more on their looks than men. At any age, their face, hair, clothes and weight come under more scrutiny than their male counterparts. Indeed, when the first female president is eventually elected, Palmieri doubts she will escape what has become known as “the pink tax.” This is the extra hour that women are expected to spend daily on their hair and makeup. As a woman, Palmieri also feels the weight of society’s expectations about what she should look like. However, now that she has reached her 50s, she’s happy for the world to see that she’s grown older. Although she sees advertisements advising her to botox her wrinkles away, she enjoys the creases on her face. They remind her that she’s had many experiences during her life: her laughter lines reassure her that life has been joyous. The frown lines between her eyebrows let her know that she’s survived stressful events in the past, and will do so again. In other words, Palmieri’s face is her life story. Why should she hide it? June 26, 2015, was no ordinary day in American politics. For Jennifer Palmieri and millions of progressive liberals like her, it was a day of celebration. The previous two days had seen the Affordable Care Act pass into law, the legalization of gay marriage and serious discussions about removing the Confederate flag from government buildings. Years of struggle had suddenly come to fruition in the space of just a week. Though Palmieri couldn’t stop smiling that day, she looks back now with mixed feelings. Even as she walked through her Brooklyn neighborhood that night and saw people everywhere celebrating progress, she wondered if there might be more sinister consequences to these societal changes. Unfortunately, her fears were warranted when, on the presidential election night of 2016, Trump was announced victorious. Palmieri saw that, far from sharing the liberals’ joy in the progressive legislation of 2015, many Americans felt angry and disillusioned. Many white, conservative voters felt their country was turning into something they no longer recognized; a place no longer in step with their traditional values and belief in small government. To these voters, the introduction of gay marriage, the removal of the Confederate flag and the courts’ support for Obamacare made them feel alienated. A backlash against these progressive policies was inevitable, and it manifested in the form of Donald Trump. In an ironic turn of events, it’s Palmieri who now feels alienated. For the first time in her life, in Trump’s America she understands what it’s like to work in an industry that has been disrupted. Trump’s campaign tore up the rule book and shook the political establishment to its core. Like the disaffected factory worker who lost his job to automation or the taxi-driver who loses everything when Uber comes to town, Palmieri has seen her own life plan exploded by an unexpected force. Despite her happiness in 2015, the joke turned out to be on her. But what exactly was this force? Was it Trump himself? No, the real force was the anger of millions of disillusioned Americans who voted against what they saw as an increasingly distant Washington. And what about now? What will the future hold? Palmieri knows only one thing for sure: politics will never be the same again. The key message in this book: Hillary Clinton faced a unique set of challenges during her presidential campaign. Despite her decades of political experience, the media and the American public expected her to act differently than other candidates simply because she was a woman. Despite this discrimination, there are things women can do to help themselves become leaders, such as speaking their minds, knowing the value of their opinions and trusting their hearts. Actionable advice: Lose without being defeated.  Hillary Clinton may have lost the election, but that doesn’t mean she was defeated. In fact, Palmieri believes that we are only truly defeated when we relinquish hope. As an ambitious woman, you’re likely to come up against many challenges and failures, but it’s how you deal with them that counts. Clinton dealt with the tough times by waking up every day and getting back out there. Then, whatever happens, she gets up the next day and does it all again. This is the sort of tenacious attitude that the first female president will need to succeed. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Maxwell","summary":"On the battlefields and in the boardroom, in classrooms and in courtrooms, leaders play a crucial role: they bring people and organizations together, guiding them along a particular path and giving them courage to carry on. But what exactly makes a leader? And how can you become one? Well, leadership comes in many different forms and leaders operate with varying degrees of sophistication. This hierarchy can be thought of as a leadership ladder, and advancing up it is a long process that requires learning self-discipline, how to prioritize tasks and how to infuse every action with integrity and vision. In short, a leader knows that her personal growth is central to the growth of her organization. If you can commit to this process, you’ll become a better leader in no time, embodying the word in everything you do. In these blinks, you’ll learn why a willingness to change is crucial to success; how Henry Ford almost failed; and why actions say more than words. Everybody – from football coaches to business executives to full-time mothers – knows that leadership is an essential quality of powerful people. But what exactly is it? In a simple sense, leadership is just influence; it’s the ability to inspire others to follow you. In other words, all moral considerations aside, anybody who can attract a group of followers qualifies as an effective leader. That includes the likes of John F. Kennedy, Winston Churchill and even Adolf Hitler. All these people were leaders simply because people followed them. That being said, it should also be noted that there’s a hierarchy of leadership. To be exact, there are five different levels: position, permission, production, people development and personhood.  The first, position, is the lowest level of leadership. It’s about having the right to be a leader. To put it differently, leaders of position are solely leaders because of their titles. The second level, permission, is about relationships. If you’ve attained this level of leadership, people follow you because you’re tuned into their needs and wishes; you listen to and value the opinions of others. As a result, leadership of this type won’t last long if you neglect the needs of others. They’ll soon lose interest and stop following you. The third level of leadership, production, is attained when relationships such as those from the second level start to produce results. At this level, your leadership is the result of your and your team’s success. People admire those results and are therefore happy to follow you. If you manage to attain the fourth level, people development, people will follow you because they value your mentorship. At this level, a leader takes care to grow the skills of others, who respond with absolute loyalty. In cases like this, people follow you because they’re thankful. The final tier of leadership is personhood. While it’s certainly attainable, it’s only reached by leaders who spend their entire lives influencing others. At this level, you’re a person who commands respect, which is what inspires others to follow you. Which level describes your current leadership status? Regardless of where you’re at, in the blinks that follow, you’ll learn how to climb the ladder and excel as a leader! So you want to develop your leadership abilities. Well, then you better know about priorities. Having solid priorities will enable you to determine what’s most important and who you should focus on. It sounds simple enough, but good leaders prioritize on more than one level. For one, you have to be able to prioritize different projects and tasks. Some of these will be important, others urgent and some will be both. This last category is the one to prioritize. For instance, writing a report on sales figures may be important, but not that urgent. Such tasks should be a part of the everyday work of your team, but they should be worked toward deliberately, not rushed. Then there are projects and tasks that aren’t important, but that are urgent. Checking your email is a prime example here. It should be done quickly so you can move on to the work that matters. And, finally, there’s work that’s neither important nor urgent, like filing documents, which can be done in brief chunks of time, maybe just once a week. Being able to break things down like this is key, because if you fail to set the right priorities, you’re bound to lead your organization in the wrong direction. But tasks and projects are just one level; you also need to be able to prioritize the energy, money, time and staff devoted to any given project or task. To do so, apply the 20/80 principle. That is, spend 80 percent of your resources – like money and energy – on the top 20 percent of your organizational priorities. Similarly, you should plan to dedicate 80 percent of your time to the top 20 percent of your most productive staff, who account for 80 percent of your organization’s success. Every priority below this, the remaining 80 percent, should be delegated and outsourced. And, naturally, new personnel should be trained by the top 20 percent of your people. To put it simply, prioritize the best people, tasks and projects. Investing in them will result in the most success. Now that you know how to set priorities, it’s time to talk about another core leadership concept: integrity. To have integrity is to adhere to a set of values without fail; these values are your compass, guiding everything you do. To put it differently, people with integrity act based on who they are. But that’s not all it means. Integrity is also about being consistent and doing what you say you’ll do. Being able to follow through like this will inspire people to trust and follow you. For example, research from Stanford University that indicates that the vast majority of learning – 89 percent of it! – is visual. In other words, if the people you lead hear you say that your job is to focus on the customer and then see you paying special attention to customers on a regular basis, they’ll eventually start doing the same. Being able to maintain such consistency will reinforce your credibility as a leader because people will know who you are and what they can expect from you. This in turn will produce trust, which is crucial to your success. After all, would you follow the advice of someone you didn’t trust? Or imagine being in the army. Would you follow your commanding officer into a dangerous situation if you thought he was a phony or worried that he might reverse his decisions at the last minute? Clearly, trust is essential to leadership, and integrity can help you build it. Integrity will also be the foundation of your long-lasting reputation. As an example, think about what it’s like to meet for the first time someone you idolize. Many people are disappointed during such meetings because the idolized individual doesn’t turn out to be the person he seemed to be from afar. Maybe he appeared to be making clear decisions, but in reality is just blowing in the wind. On the other hand, people with integrity secure a reputation that endures. That’s because, if you have integrity, there’ll be no difference between the person you seem to be from afar and the person you are in meetings and day-to-day interactions. You might think you’re a pretty good leader, but how can you be sure? One way is to assess how beneficial your work has been. In fact, this criterion is so important that creating positive change is the third principle of leadership. Leaders need to be ever ready to change; if they’re not, their inflexibility can negatively affect the entire organization. A leader must be able to adapt. For instance, when Henry Ford created the Model T, he became so infatuated with the car that he refused to consider changing a single detail; he believed it was perfect as it was. Because of this, he even fired his top production official, William Knudsen, who suggested a new design. Ford may have been a manufacturing genius, but such a rigid resistance to change was a major misstep. Remember, the world moves at a rapid pace and competition is fierce. To succeed in this environment, your business has to embrace the possibility that major shifts will occur. If you can’t change, your organization won’t be able to, either. In Ford’s case, changing the Model T was simply necessary. Despite what Ford thought about the car, it was old-fashioned and General Motors had already started developing more modern vehicles that the Model T would have to compete with. While Ford remained reluctant for years, he finally did update the Model T, releasing the Model A and maintaining his strong position in the automobile industry. But, as a leader, you must do more than simply embrace change. You also need to recognize the psychological challenges that change can impose on your employees. Change requires employees to step out of their comfort zones and face dramatically new contexts, and this is bound to lead to stress and insecurity. So to help employees ease into this process, you should do everything you can to ensure that they know in advance why the change is happening as well as the objectives it seeks to realize. By keeping your employees informed, you give them the chance to take ownership of the change, which will reduce its negative impacts. Do you take pride in your self-discipline? Can you accomplish everything you set out to do without anybody cheering you on from the sidelines? Well, if not, you better learn how to, because self-discipline is a key trait of all leaders. If you can’t follow your own lead, how can you expect others to? To put it differently, as a leader, your growth is essential to the growth of your organization. That being said, growth requires hard work. And this is where many people become their own worst enemy; they lack self-discipline and, as a result, fall short as leaders. So get started today with a small but committed plan that involves a daily routine. Starting slow is important as it takes time to build up self-discipline and nobody can do everything at once. Consider the basketball team of Indiana University. In 1976, they won the NCAA National Championship. After the victory, their coach did an interview on 60 Minutes, explaining that the primary reason for the team’s success was its self-discipline and willingness to continually prepare and improve. Here’s what you can do to set yourself up for the same kind of success: Begin by writing down and ranking five areas where you want to become more disciplined. Then find someone who is already disciplined in the area you put as your top priority and ask him or her to help you check your progress. From there, spend 15 minutes every morning focusing on this area of improvement and take five minutes twice every day – once at noon and once in the evening – to reflect on your progress. If you repeat this daily routine for 60 days, you should have built up the self-discipline you need for success in this area, and you can cross it off your list and move on to the next priority. And don’t forget that it’s important to celebrate when you master a new area, preferably with the person who helped you through the process! Do you consider yourself a visionary person? Well, to be a leader, you have to have a vision of where you’re headed and how you’ll persuade others to follow you there. In this sense, a vision is simply a clear idea of what the organization in general, and your team in particular, should do. Your vision is what fuels your day-to-day work. For instance, did you know that Beethoven was deaf for the final 20 years of his life, including during the time he wrote some of his most famous compositions? Or did you know that Homer was blind and that Rockefeller, when he first started working, earned just six dollars per week? Nonetheless, all these great figures accomplished incredible things because they believed deeply in what they wanted to achieve. In other words, they had a vision and lived by it. Conversely, if you don't have a vision, it’ll be difficult to lead others toward a goal. In fact, doing so is simply not possible without the drive, perseverance and team spirit that a vision brings. Okay, so if you feel that you lack a vision, what can you do? Well, try thinking about what you feel deep down inside yourself. What do you dream of? What keeps you going day after day? Ask these questions in regards to every aspect of your life. Remember: Only when you see where you’re headed will you be able to get there. But keep in mind that a vision alone doesn’t make a leader; you also need the experience to walk the path you set out on. Such experience is what sets a vision apart from naive idealism. For example, if you lack experience, you might expect people to follow your vision blindly, never asking questions. But if you have led others before and have a wealth of leadership experiences under your belt, you’ll know that people won’t just trustingly follow a vision laid out by some random person. People follow leaders. Once your leadership attracts followers, it’ll be easy to get them to share your vision as well. The key message in this book: Leadership isn’t about being bossy and ordering others around. Rather, good leaders set strong examples and work diligently to improve themselves personally. They live by their values, are open to change and are guided by a vision that they summon from deep within themselves. Actionable advice: A good leader listens to his team.  The next time one of your team members comes to you with a question or concern, be sure to listen carefully to whatever is voiced. It’s important to focus on more than the literal words that are being spoken. Pay attention to tone of voice and body language, and if the team member says something you disagree with, don’t get annoyed or interrupt. By listening in this way, you might gain valuable information that you’d otherwise have missed entirely. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

The problem, however, is getting there. Corporate bids to improve the representation of minorities by means of quotas often lead to controversy. Worst of all, new appointees end up feeling like they’ve been hired to make up the numbers rather than because of their talents. So what’s the solution? Well, that’s the question two of Australia’s top entrepreneurs and diversity champions set out to to answer in these blinks. The best place to start, Nicky Howe and Alicia Curtis argue, is to redefine the term itself. What really matters aren’t visible differences between people but their unique perspectives on the world – call it “diversity of thought.” And creating a corporate culture that’s committed to fostering open-ended, inclusive dialogue is something that begins long before applicants’ résumés land in your inbox. The key is to change the way you think and behave in the boardroom. Luckily, there’s a wealth of cognitive tools out there to help you do just that. So read on to learn how to start making your company more diverse! Along the way, you’ll learn why diversity is so important in today’s world; how our biases prevent companies becoming more inclusive; and why “groupthink” is responsible for poor decision-making in the boardroom. What is diversity? Lots of people answer this question by making reference to visible differences such as gender or race. That’s an okay start, but it doesn’t tell the whole story. Just think of what makes you unique. Chances are, intangibles like your personality, life experiences and beliefs would rank pretty high, right? Well, that’s pretty much the point: there’s more to people than meets the eye. That’s why the Oxford Handbook of Human Resource Management shifts the focus from obvious markers of difference to the wide variety of qualities of people within organizations. Diversity, in other words, is about recognizing that every person is a rich tapestry woven together from multiple threads. Age, education, abilities, disabilities, culture, experience, ideology, profession and, of course, race and gender – to name just a few factors – all shape who we are. Unfortunately, we often focus on what we can see and ignore the invisible threads. That leads to the common fallacy that people who look alike have the same views. Nothing, however, could be further from the truth. And that’s the foundation stone of a broader, and more accurate, understanding of diversity: what really matters is diversity of thought. And why does it matter to companies? Well, equal representation is not only good in its own right, it’s also an essential part of doing business in today’s world. That’s because we live in an age which is increasingly Volatile, Uncertain, Complex and Ambiguous – call it “VUCA” for short. The world is constantly changing. Just think of Asia. By 2050, two thirds of the global middle class and 20 of the largest 50 cities will be Asian – up from only eight cities in 2007. Then there’s digital innovation. Once iconic household names like Kodak and Blockbusters have been eclipsed by upstarts like Uber, Facebook and Airbnb. Globalization has meanwhile created a business environment in which companies have to scout for top talent across borders and organizations, not just across the city. If you want to keep pace with those changes and capitalize on the opportunities they present, your company’s board and management needs to be every bit as diverse as the markets in which they operate. And that’s all about being open, adaptable and flexible – something that’s a whole lot easier if you’re drawing your leaders from the largest possible pool! Diversity pays. That’s the view of the business world’s leading analysts. Take management consultancy McKinsey’s 2014 report Diversity Matters. It shows that highly diverse companies are 35 percent more likely to enjoy above-industry-average returns than their less diverse counterparts. That’s hardly surprising. According to the same report, women and minority groups make the majority of consumer decisions, so it stands to reason that companies which better represent these groups are good at attracting their business. But if it’s such a no-brainer, why aren’t more companies cashing in? In a word, bias. Humans are naturally prone to judging people according to clichés rather than their actual merits. These biases come in a number of different forms. Implicit stereotypes link certain groups with supposedly typical traits: think of the association between men and science or Asians and math, for example. Then there’s in-group favoritism. That’s an age-old human tendency to prefer people who are like us. Finally, there’s outgroup homogeneity, the readiness to believe that other groups are less “complex” than our own. These snap judgments have a huge effect on hiring policies and boardroom behaviors. Ever wondered why so many firms’ boards consist entirely of middle-aged white men, why everyone in leadership positions went to the same school or why meetings are held at times that exclude people with family commitments? Put it down to bias! Bias might be innate, but that doesn’t mean you can’t unlearn it. That’s why today’s most effective leaders take time to identify their false assumptions and adopt corrective strategies to overcome behavior that reproduces narrow group advantages. A great place to start is by taking surveys like the Harvard Implicit Association Test (IAT), an online tool which can help you identify subconscious patterns of association concerning weight, race, gender and age. Simply becoming mindful of these biases provides an opportunity for self-correction, allowing you to ask yourself questions like, “Did I just assume that a male candidate is more ambitious than a female candidate because she has two kids?” But the most effective tactic against bias is to become more aware of the world around you – call it cultural competency. Whether it’s learning a new language, traveling with an open mind or simply going out of your way to have meaningful conversations with people who aren’t like you, you can become a greater champion of diversity by living it out on a day-to-day basis. So we’re prone to favoring people like us and forming small, like-minded groups. In this blink, we’ll take a look at one of the most dangerous effects of this phenomenon – groupthink – and how to overcome it. Groupthink is the tendency of highly cohesive groups to favor consensus and make bad calls when they’re under pressure. The term was coined by psychologist Irving Janis, the author of a 1972 study analyzing US foreign policy fiascos, such as the failed Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in 1961 and the escalation of the Vietnam war. But it’s not just military strategists that are susceptible to groupthink. Boards are just as likely to overrule valid objections and steamroll ahead with their plans when they need to make a quick decision. The best way of avoiding that trap is to cultivate an open-minded approach to solving problems. How? Well, that’s where psychologist Edward de Bono’s idea of the Six Thinking Hats comes in. It’s essentially a cognitive tool to help facilitate critical thought, collaboration, communication and creativity. Here’s how it works: Imagine six hats, each a different color representing a different style of thought. Each piece of headgear is as easy to don as it is to take off. That’s handy because each member of the board will be trying out each hat in turn. The first is the White Hat, representing a sober, unbiased consideration of the facts. The Red Hat is for emotions: its wearer can discuss their feelings on a matter. The Black Hat stands for pessimism – wearing it provides a chance to discuss the downsides of a decision. Then there’s the Yellow Hat, the optimistic hat that lets you dwell on the pros rather than the cons. The Green Hat meanwhile stands for creativity – when you’re wearing it, you should feel free to try out new ideas without worrying about being judged. Finally, the Blue Hat is to ensure that the all six hats are being used correctly. This exercise works best when you’re posing specific questions for each color. So rational White might ask, “What are the facts?” while Black would want to know, “What are the consequences of failure?” and Red would ask, “How do you feel about it?” By using it in the boardroom, you can make sure that everyone is working hard to look at an issue from every possible angle. Emotions play a huge role in the day-to-day life of boardrooms and the decisions made there. Just think of how often you intuitively sense that something’s up. That’s a physical reaction triggered by the limbic system, the part of the brain that controls emotional reactions. That means simply trying to suppress your feelings won’t work – in fact, your best bet for improving your decision-making is to learn to observe and manage your moods. So how do you do that? Well, let’s start with a definition. A mood is basically a filter that determines the way you see and respond to the world around you. According to life coach Alan Sieler, there are six Basic Moods of Life. These come about as the result of negative or positive responses to what he calls Facticity, Possibility and Uncertainty. Let’s break those down. Facticity refers to things that are beyond your control – your age, say, or who is the current CEO of the company. Acceptance of these facts leads to a mood of peace while opposition leads to resentment. Possibility, on the other hand, is about things you see as changeable, like getting a new puppy or making your board more diverse. Accepting possibility here leads to ambition, opposing it leads to resignation. Finally there’s Uncertainty, which refers to the things you can’t predict, such as organizational change or the weather. Embracing that randomness leads to a mood of wonder, while rejecting it leads to anxiety. That’s pretty abstract, right? Well, let’s put it into context. Imagine you’ve had a run-in with a sharp-tongued colleague and it’s left you in a foul mood. Now, the past can’t be undone. That means you’re confronted with an example of facticity – something you can’t change. The only thing you do have some influence over is your response. If that’s something like, “I can’t believe she talked to me like that,” you’re opposing that reality and likely to become resentful. But what happens if you accept her behavior? It suddenly becomes much easier to say, “Oh well, these things happen,” or “Maybe she was just having a difficult morning.” That doesn’t just shift your mood towards one of peace – it also puts you in a position to get out of your head and reach out to her. Rather than resentfully ruminating, you can ask your colleague if something’s wrong and if you can help! So far, we’ve looked at some personal strategies to become more open to diverse ways of thinking. In this blink, we’ll be shifting our focus to collective boardroom game plans that you can use to help your company commit itself to becoming a champion of diversity. So where do you start? Well, the key is to make sure the entire board is on the same page. That means you’ll need to start a conversation. Diversity, as we’ve learned, has plenty of advantages, but there’s more than one way to get there. If you want to find the policy that’s right for your organization, you’ll need to generate ideas that suit your needs. This is known as a speculative conversation – an attempt to figure out where you are right now and where you want to go. In other words, does the governance of your organization reflect the diversity of the communities and customers which it serves? To answer that, you’ll need the facts and figures at hand. Those are actually easier to come by than you might think. Your own firm’s customer relations management systems should have plenty of hard data on who your customers actually are. Hitting up local government statistics bureaus should take care of the rest. Right, now you’re ready to start talking! This can be a sensitive matter – after all, no one likes being confronted with their own biases – so it’s best to be patient and remember that becoming truly inclusive takes time. Here are a few questions to get the ball rolling: If your company doesn’t reflect the demographic diversity of its customers, how can you reach out to underrepresented groups? Could you, for example, advertise positions in community newspapers? Do you take knowledge of other languages and cultures into account when you make hiring decisions? Do you ask candidates for leadership positions how they feel about working with people from diverse backgrounds? One important thing to remember as you go through this process is that “tokenism” often does more harm than good. As the authors discovered while running a program to encourage young leaders onto boards, nothing undermined the confidence and morale of “diverse” people so much as the feeling that they’d been hired to fill a quota. Diversification strategies work best when companies enable diverse newcomers to make an impact from the get-go by giving them real responsibilities. Doing that not only makes new board members feel welcome – it also allows you to start acting on their unique perspectives, thus enriching your company! The key message in these blinks: Diversity isn’t just desirable in and of itself – it’s also great for business. That’s hardly surprising. We live in an increasingly complex world, so it stands to reason that the companies which best represent their diverse customer bases should prosper. The reason more companies aren’t embracing a more inclusive approach to leadership, however, is simple: human bias. Luckily, the tendency to favor in-groups can be unlearned. By adopting the strategies in these blinks, you can start recognizing harmful stereotypes, allowing you to foster an open and inclusive workplace and build a more diverse boardroom.  Actionable advice: Listen to what your body’s telling your about your mood! We’ve already talked about the importance of moods in shaping your perception of the world, but how do you actually recognize these often subtle emotional states? Well, it’s usually a safe bet that your body is already trying to tell you. So start by observing your body language: tightness in your face, jaw, neck and shoulders, for example, is a tell-tale sign that you’re battling with negative emotions. Once you’ve checked in with your body, ask yourself some follow-up questions: “What am I rejecting in this situation?,” “What am I opposed to?” and, finally, “What is my current mood?” That should help you clarify your feelings and start putting a positive spin on things.

What to read next: The Inclusion Dividend, by Mark Kaplan and Mason Donovan “I’m not sexist, it’s just that the top candidates are all guys.” “I don’t believe in quotas – surely you should pick the best person for the job, whatever the color of their skin?” You’ve probably come across these kinds of arguments against diversity before, but just how well do they stack up against the evidence? Well, that’s exactly the question that Mark Kaplan and Mason Donovan wanted to answer when they looked into the matter.

Once a popular and profitable retailer, Blockbuster ended up at rock bottom when the traditional DVD rental model collapsed. It’s a sad tale and a warning to others. No business owner wants to be the next Blockbuster.  Blockbuster is just one example of a business that failed to stay ahead of the curve. These blinks offer a lot of advice to help today’s businesses avoid a similar fate. As they point out, we’re currently in the middle of the digital era. Businesses which fail to adapt to this digital age will be left behind. This includes all those businesses which merely pay lip service to the digital world, without fully embracing it. Digital Darwinism requires you to integrate the digital era into the DNA of your business, not just to add a website with a virtual tour of your business. It’s only a matter of time before digital technology becomes like electricity and is a seamless part of our daily lives. So this is what tomorrow’s leading businesses will need to embrace. In these blinks, you’ll find out why you don’t want to be like Heathrow Airport; why the traditional understanding of disruption is all wrong; and why adding a chat bot to your business won’t get you very far. We often think in terms of “survival of the fittest.” But what does that mean for businesses today, when rapid global change is an ongoing concern? You may think that the most successful companies will always be the massive ones with teams of experts and billions to spend. But, as the author sees it, darwinism in the digital age is about being able to flourish by taking advantage of that rapid global change – it’s about being able to adapt quickly to whatever the uncertain future may bring. Big businesses with a global reach that have been around for 30 to 50 years are no longer the most successful companies out there. In fact, these businesses may be at a disadvantage. After all, they can easily end up so stuck in their ways that they find it difficult to make any changes at all.  For example, Sony invested greatly in making devices such as the Walkman and Discman to play music on cassettes or CDs. This helped them become the market leaders. And then MP3 and digital music happened. Sony could have moved into this new, and potentially very lucrative market. But if this digital music really took off, what would happen to all the Walkmans and Discmans? They’d be outdated. They wouldn’t sell. So, Sony saw the move to digital as a very risky act of self-disruption. As a result, the company was hesitant to move in the new market and it lost its leading position to more disruptive rivals. Instead, too many businesses are only willing to make small gestures toward embracing new technologies. The author refers to this as a “bolted-on” approach. An example of this is when a bank creates an app that allows a check to be deposited by snapping a photo of it, rather than rethinking the need for using paper checks in this day and age. They’re simply wedging technology into a dying system. A good analogy is Heathrow Airport, London. Bucket-loads of money have been spent trying to update Heathrow, despite the fact that it’s located in an area that makes it difficult for planes to maneuver and will be an unwieldy mess no matter how many alterations are made. At some point, a new airport will be built with room to grow in a practical location using modern technology at its very core. In other words, simply trying to update a burdensome, outdated system is unsustainable.  For legacy businesses, it’s essentially the same situation. Instead of tweaking an ailing system, you must be willing to make fundamental changes in order to truly adapt. If there’s one thing for certain, it’s that the future is uncertain. Sure, there are a lot of people willing to sound foolish by trying to predict the future, but no one can be truly certain of what lies ahead. That said, we can look to the past and learn a lot about what to expect in the years ahead. If we look back over our recent history, we can recognize three important eras that demonstrate a pattern in how businesses respond to new technology. By looking at the advent of electricity and computers, we can see that we’re in the middle of a very similar era regarding the internet. In each of these eras, people were, on the whole, reluctant to embrace a new technology and fully incorporate it into society. Time and time again, people applied the technology to their traditional ways of doing things. Old and new would bump up against each other in chaotic ways until, inevitably, the new technology became accepted, fully integrated and so commonplace in everyday life that it was practically seamless. This happened with electricity, but it took a long time. Starting in the 1830s, when its potential for businesses and homes was first presented, it took around 100 years for electricity to become commonplace. For a long time, there was no standardization and factories that had relied on steam power were hesitant to change their ways.  It also took a long time for electricity to be used for truly innovative purposes. For the most part, companies spent decades simply making electrified versions of machines and appliances that already existed. It took an age for companies to learn that they didn’t need updated factories; they needed new, electricity-focused factories. A similar process happened with computers and digital technology, though in both cases the time it took from introduction to mass acceptance took half as long as before. For computers, there was a 50-year mid-period between arrival and full acceptance. In this period, cautious businesses tried to computerize just a few processes while holding on to as many of their traditional processes as possible. Some of the conflict of the computer era was resolved with the introduction of the digital era, which included the internet. PCs and Macs, which had been incompatible, were now able to connect with one another over the internet. But once again, we find ourselves with many businesses just applying modern technology on the fringes of their business.  Clayton Christensen, a Harvard Business School academic, described disruption in the business world as a new company that comes along with a new technology and a lower price to undermine the legacy companies. But this description doesn’t quite fit.    When you think of some of the biggest disruptors in recent years, like Uber or Airbnb, you can see that these businesses didn’t have a lower price and nor did they just bring along some new technology. After all, Airbnb customers might spend more than they would for a traditional hotel. What disruptors really do is completely rethink the way of doing things, be it running a car service or operating in the hospitality industry. In other words, they shift the paradigm and fundamentally change how people do things. In order to truly disrupt an industry you have to do more than bolt-on some new technology and offer a cheaper price – you have to go beyond the outer layers of your business and have bold innovation at the core of your being. The outer layers of a business include how you communicate with your customers, your marketing efforts, what your product or service is and how your business functions. Most businesses have added technology to these layers, such as using emailed newsletters and Instagram accounts as marketing tools. Few have put technology and truly innovative ways of doing business at their core. Take the car rental company Hertz, for example. It’s made it possible for you to send a recorded video of your customer complaint, rather than having to fill out an online form. It’s using technology as a tool while remaining committed to its traditional car rental business plan. If Hertz were to really embrace the digital age, it would change that core business plan to resemble something similar to how Zipcar, the rental service, operates, and make the entire process app-based. One of the keys to coming up with an innovative plan is to think of ideas that aren’t boxed in by the assumed parameters of your industry. Companies like Uber and Airbnb removed the assumed parameter that a company had to own physical assets, like cars and rooms, in order to connect customers with a ride from point A to point B or a room to stay in during their vacation.  When your idea finds a solution that changes those parameters, you may be on your way to shifting the paradigm and causing real disruption. You don’t necessarily have to be a new business in order to disrupt your industry. In fact, there are essentially four ways for any established business to change and be innovative. The first is self-disruption, which means investing in a technology or way of doing things that would, if successful, make your current process obsolete. This is also referred to as “cannibalism” in the business world and, while it can be risky and difficult, it can also pay off big time. Just think of how Netflix pulled off a remarkable act of self-disruption when it shifted its focus from DVD rentals to streaming. In 2007, after investing $40 million dollars in new data storage, Netflix allowed existing members to stream a limited number of hours of content at no extra cost, while their library of streamable content steadily grew. Then, in 2011, Netflix made the subscription plans for renting DVDs and streaming content separate. Not only that, they made the streaming plan cheaper and moved the DVD plan to a service called Qwikster. Within months, stock prices plummeted from $42 a share to below $10, and Wall Street was calling for CEO Reed Hastings to step down. But Netflix knew streaming was the way of the future. After weathering the initial storm, it became apparent that a lot of new subscribers were attracted to the lower subscription fee, and the library of content continued to expand. Now those shares are selling at over $100. This leads us to the second way of changing: continual reinvention. Instead of making a rigid and inflexible operation plan, make having room to adapt an essential and fundamental part of your business. Think of how Facebook naturally evolved from a place to reconnect with an old friend to being the most powerful media company in the world. It’s no coincidence that Facebook spends millions every year on research and development. The last two ways to cultivate change are making measured and hedged bets. A measured bet is like BMW making a relatively small number of electric vehicles in their BMWi series. BMW don’t count on these cars to be its main source of profit, but the venture allows it to develop new technology. Maybe one day BMWi technology will be used to improve the company’s other car models. Hedging is what companies like Google, Dell, Cisco and Intel do when they invest in other businesses that may develop cutting edge ideas that could be beneficial for them. This is the whole idea behind Google Ventures, or why a plastics and chemical manufacturer like DuPont invested in General Motors when the car manufacturer was just getting off the ground in 1914. Just as it was clear that streaming video was the way of the future over a decade ago, we can also make some safe assumptions about the future growth of other emerging digital technologies. When exploring what the next big thing will be, it helps to try and see one or two steps down the road. For instance, when smartphones emerged, the real innovative minds looked to the further implications of this technology, like the apps and emojis and all the different secondary business opportunities that the smartphone would unleash. One area that is being explored today is known as the Internet of Things. This is what people are calling the advent of the 5G internet service. 5G will make it possible for more and more devices to be connected to each other in real time. This is not only about being able to process more data than ever before, it’s also about allowing seamless transactions to take place. An early example of what the Internet of Things will look like is the digital thermostats being made by Nest. The Nest thermostat makes it easy to program the heating and air-conditioning in your home. It shows us that it’s just a matter of time before you can have your home’s temperature, lighting and background music ready for you when you walk in the door. The Nest thermometer is the kind of forward thinking that more businesses should be moving toward, as it’s making digital technology a seamless part of modern living. This is exactly what happened with electricity and computers. Tomorrow’s leading businesses will be the ones making this seamless interaction happen in digitally connected homes. You could also look at facial recognition technology as an example. Soon, your face could be just as valid a form of ID as your passport. So the idea of being able to travel without a paper passport, or being able to pay by doing nothing more than showing your face, is very much a possibility. Is it that hard to imagine your bank account and travel permissions being linked to one paperless source of ID? Of course, facial recognition technology and other possible aspects of the Internet of Things lead to questions about privacy and data security, which is why businesses need to focus on being secure and transparent about how they treat people’s data. From what we can already see, it’s very likely that the benefits of a seamless digitally assisted life will, for most people, outweigh these concerns. Therefore, it’s up to future companies to give people security as well as great value in return for their data. One of the reasons Amazon’s one-button-purchase option is so impressive is that it understands the difference between shopping and buying. While businesses can try to make shopping a memorable experience, more forward-thinking businesses should consider what Amazon has done and make the buying experience as quick, painless and unmemorable as possible.  If a buying experience is memorable, it’s usually because it was a bad experience. A good buying experience is effortless and easy, like taking care of the entire process with one push of a button. The world is still filled with digital disappointments, like businesses not accepting your preferred online payment method or not being able to stream your favorite BBC show outside the United Kingdom. Basically, the only time we really pay attention to technology these days is when it isn’t working. The leaders of tomorrow will be the businesses that make things like buying products and streaming content easy, no matter where you are. Ultimately, making things seamless and easy isn’t about knowing which technology is the most cutting edge. It’s about empathy and knowing what people want and how to make it simpler for them to achieve that goal. So forget about buzzwords like “interactive” and “digital” and think about the tools that people are already using and how to make those tools more connected. We can see that the digital era is moving us toward a hybrid world, where bluetooth speakers are also portals that can help us buy things or access information. Soon enough, there will be no regional restrictions to content and things like national currency will be less of a concern. It’s time to think across all boundaries and how we can help people everywhere have better, more frictionless experiences with the technology that is already making its way into every part of our lives. For one last example: a lot of people are pointing at AI, or artificial intelligence, as one of the big technologies of the future, and that will likely be the case. But how many businesses are just bolting a chat bot onto their website as a way of saying, hey, we use AI?  The real innovative and disruptive companies will be the ones that use this kind of technology to do new transformative things. They’ll always have the latest tech at the core of their business plan as a tool for helping people in innovative ways. The key message in these blinks: Digital darwinism isn’t about being the strongest or wealthiest business. It’s about being agile and capable of quickly adapting to the changing global marketplace. Companies can stay ahead of the pack by putting innovation and a willingness to change at the core of their business plan. They can also concentrate on looking beyond accepted parameters toward new ways of doing things and helping people to live in the digital era in a more seamless way.  Actionable advice: Create new forms of value. Often, when visiting his parents, the author is willing to take a slower train ride because it offers reliable wi-fi and plenty of places to plug in his devices. By providing these services, the train line created a new form of value by embracing the digital age. In other ways, businesses can create value by saving the customer time and effort, whether it’s a bank that stores all of a customer’s receipts digitally or an app that lets you skip the long checkout line at a store. So start thinking about how your business can create new forms of value for customers by being more integrated with the digital era and your customers’ needs.    Got feedback?

What to read next: On the Origin of Species, by Charles Darwin You’ve probably heard the term “Darwinism” before, and now you’ve heard it applied to the business world. But how familiar are you with the text that first brought the idea of Darwinism to the world? On the Origin of Species is a classic that forever changed the way people look at the natural world. Darwinism is about more than just “survival of the fittest,” and there’s no better way to understand the principles of adaptation and evolution than to go to the source and discover the ideas of Charles Darwin himself.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

And consider this: that was also the dream of children a generation ago – to meet a favorite Disney character at a theme park. How has one company managed to do this? How has Disney managed to stay at the heart of Western culture for well over half a century? The answer lies, partly, in the amazing way they train their staff at Disney University. In this special place, Disney employees are taught all they will ever need to know about treating customers like VIPs. In these blinks, you’ll learn how to do that, too. In these blinks, you’ll also discover why Disney managers held crucial meetings in Cinderella’s Castle; why great customer service is a mixture of art and science; and why you can’t buy alcohol at Disneyland Tokyo, but can at Disneyland Paris. The employees are the most important part of any business, especially in a customer-focused industry. You can't achieve success without a well-trained, motivated and happy staff. So keep your workforce happy by providing them with values, not just physical goods. Most companies fail here because they assume they can motivate their employees solely with pay or bonuses or little perks. They don't realize they need to share the company's values with them, too. If your employees don't care about your company's values, they won't be interested in its progress or stakeholders. They'll only be concerned with their own material needs. Disney strives to avoid this. They carefully promote the company's philosophy at Disney University, where staff (or cast members, in Disney terms) is trained. The cast members come to share the company's values, so they feel a much deeper connection to it. You also need to keep your employees happy. The best way to do this is to ensure that the management stays in close contact with them. The management should know immediately if the employees encounter any problems. Van France, the founder of Disney University, used to take walks through the institution to see how the cast members were doing. During one of his walks, he noticed a problem with the orientation program for newly hired members: the company and its parks had expanded so quickly that trainees were struggling under the old orientation program, which had become too small. It was out of date. So France developed a new orientation program that was more suited to the needs of the company and its trainees. The management should always be aware of the organization's inner workings, and seek out ways to make work more efficient and enjoyable. Is building a successful business a science or an art? Well, it's really a combination of both. Your organization's “scientific side” is about its infrastructure and physical products. For Disney, that means building and maintaining the parks and attractions. Disney's success largely depends on the layout of their parks, and on their quality, cleanliness and exciting rides. But great infrastructure and well-engineered roller coasters aren't enough on their own. That's where Disney's artistic side comes in! A business's artistic side is what gives it that special touch that sets it apart. The staff holds the key to the business's “art.” After all, it's up to the staff to make the customer’s experience special, and that’s what makes all the difference at Disneyland. Disney approaches this challenge and maintains their artistry in several ways. First, they teach the staff the interpersonal skills they need to have positive interactions with customers. Children tend to be very excited about visiting Disneyland because they get to meet their heroes, like Snow White or Donald Duck; clearly, the cast members who play those characters have a lot to live up to. They need extensive training. Cast members who play Disney characters also have to adapt to being surrounded by an audience at all times, and they need to know how to interact with guests of all ages. Disney performers also need a lot of technical skill. The guests should feel like they're walking through a fairy tale when they're in a park, so Disney wants their actors to seem like living film characters. The actor playing Snow White has to know how her every movement ought to look. She literally has to transform into the character. You can probably name a few companies that once dominated their market but eventually fell into bankruptcy. Nokia, Kodak, Blockbuster – each suffered this fate. Why? Companies often collapse when they fail to keep up with changes. They cling to the business practices that once made them successful, even when those practices no longer work. A company can also fail if it changes too quickly, however. If it abandons strategies that work and adopts new ones that don't, the company risks destroying itself. So how do you find the balance between changing and staying the same? Here's Disney's key: keep one foot in the past and one in the future. Naturally, Disney keeps up with the latest in animation, and its parks are highly advanced. But no company values its history more than Disney. When Walt Disney died, for example, the company knew they had to keep his spirit alive. So they organized a new program to uphold the Disney tradition, where newly hired cast members could learn about the company. They learned how it got its start and what made it so great in the first place. Preserving the past and moving into the future are equally important, but they're both useless without another critical tool: feedback! You'll never be successful if you don't receive ongoing feedback from the people working with you. When a Disney executive visited one of these tradition programs - called Disney Traditions - he noticed a flaw. The first questions the newly hired members asked were about work schedules, salary and what their costumes looked like. The tradition program, however, taught them first about the company. So the executive changed the order of the program. When new employees got their personal information first, they were much more engaged in learning about the company, because they saw themselves as a part of it. Language is what sets humans apart from other living creatures, but businesses often fail to cash in on its potential. They fall back on boring jargon, like “dynamism,” “energizing” or “going the extra mile.” Those words aren't engaging! If you want to use really great business language, you need to step it up! Use a trick called the language of success to make your customers and employees feel more valued. That means using unique language that sets your company apart from all the others. Small changes make a difference: Disney uses its own special names for various parts of the company. Employees are cast members and customers are guests. Disney parks don't have “crowds” – they have an audience. These terms might sound odd, but they really do change the way the employees and customers feel; Disney's unique language immerses them in the magic of the Disney environment. Disney adapted these terms to suit the branches of their company that speak different languages as well. If you want your company to succeed globally, you have to take the time and care to make sure that it resonates with people of different cultures. For example Disney parks in different countries have different rules. When Disney opened Tokyo Disneyland, they maintained the drinking rules that are enforced in the US: no alcohol anywhere in the park. Japanese people responded well to this and many wrote letters to Disney thanking them for it. One housewife wrote that her husband wouldn't have spent time with her and their children if the park had sold sake. The alcohol rule didn't go over well in France, however. The French press criticized Disney for their insensitivity to French culture, so wine is now allowed at the park in Paris. Running a company is a bit like being married. There are always ups and downs, and times when you just want to give up. It's not possible for a business to avoid these difficult times. So what do you do when they hit? Even a company as strong and well structured as Disney faces problems. In 1971, for example, Roy Disney, the company's inspirational leader, died a mere two months after Walt Disney World was opened. His death was very hard on the cast members, as many of them had been close to him. Understandably, the cast was generally demoralized and struggled to focus on their work or perform with smiling faces. When you reach a tough period like this, the best thing to do is have everyone come together and work it out as a group. Don't give up! Gather your team and have everyone share their ideas on how to make the situation better. Try to get something positive out of it. When Roy Disney died, the managers held emergency meetings in the tower of Cinderella's Castle. They discussed the issue and collected feedback from everyone on the team, and eventually came up with some ideas for reinvigorating the company and its employees, like improving the staff training and HR department. In the end, the company only became stronger. And there's another reason that running a business is like being married: one of the keys to a successful marriage is to not think of yourself all the time. Instead, think about what you have to give. In business, this means you shouldn't focus only on money and profit. You also have to help your staff have fun! Walt Disney understood this well. His motto was “Work hard, play hard,” and he was always ready to plan fun events for his staff and let them enjoy themselves. The key message in this book: A company's character and strength depends on its staff. Disney understands this well. They give their employees more than just a good salary; they include them in the Disney magic by sharing their values and making them understand the legacy they're a part of. Disney holds onto traditions and looks for new ideas, and they work together through difficult times. Even if your organization isn't as big as Disney, you can still incorporate many of their successful ideas. Actionable advice: Have fun! Van France, the man responsible for Disney's unique training process, once said, “The business we’re in, if we can’t have fun, how could we expect the public to have fun?” So help your staff enjoy themselves! They won't just feel better; they'll be more productive workers, too.

Perhaps you’re in charge of a team or a department, or maybe you’re convinced that you could be a leader, but aren’t sure which next steps to take? Well, in any of those cases, these blinks are for you. They explain what it takes to become an effective leader – that is, someone who achieves his or her goals and who excels at solving difficult problems, not by any means necessary, but by doing the right thing. They also explain how to become more efficient in doing the great work you already do so you can achieve the same results in less time and with less effort. There are twelve concrete measures that will help you achieve superb results; these blinks introduce you to nine of them. You’ll also discover about a top company that didn’t invest in a young start-up called “Google”; why sleep makes you a better leader; and what the medical term “triage” has to do with excellent time management. Being the leader of a company is like being the captain of a ship: It’s your job to get your company and its crew to the desired destination while steering clear of any iceberg-like disasters. And just as there are guidelines to help captains effectively navigate ships, there are simple practices that can help leaders stay on the path to success. The first practice is to set clear goals for your team that align with the overall mission of the company. With the right kinds of goals, you can do a number of important things. Goals give focus, and by focusing your team members you provide them with a sense of purpose. And purpose leads to productivity. A tangible goal is the engine driving your team. It gives meaning to their work. It allows them to see the big picture, which will motivate them to continue working even if they’re stuck with a difficult or boring task. In short, meaning will imbue your team with determination. But remember: make sure the goal is perfectly aligned with the company’s strategy. This alignment will prevent people from wasting time on projects that don’t advance the company in the right direction. This brings us to the next practice: communication. If you’re not clear and specific about what your team should be doing, there’s a good chance you’ll waste time and money on ineffective workers who are unsure about how they can be useful. One company was handling a job for a client who needed a specific spelling for a certain word. But due to a communication breakdown, the team was never told how important this request was and hundreds of copies of material had to be revised and reprinted. Obviously, you don’t want to end up in a situation like that. So, to practice good communication, remember these three things: Remind your team of what’s expected in a simple and straightforward way. Make sure everyone knows exactly how they’re contributing to the goal. And provide both written and verbal instructions to ensure there’s no misunderstanding. Change: some people love it and some people hate it. There are those who can’t wait to get their hands on the newest gadget and those who prefer to do things the old-fashioned way. But whatever your personal preference might be, as a leader, you need to be willing to adapt and change with the modern world if you hope to keep your company profitable. It’s a simple fact: As the world changes, the way people do business in your industry will change, too. If you look at today’s most successful companies, they’ve all adapted to globalization and the technological innovations associated with mobile computers and the internet. Inevitably, the companies that refuse change, and insist on playing by the same old rules, are doomed to fail. Imagine if a shipping company in the 1990s insisted that the internet was just a passing fad, and the company’s leader refused to start a website or use email. Do you think they’d still be around today? What people who fail to embrace change and innovation don’t realize is that they’re missing out on great opportunities. When Google first emerged, the shortsighted executives at Yahoo actually rejected an offer to invest in the young start-up, and you can bet that they’re still kicking themselves. By embracing new ideas, you can also attract new clients and keep your company looking fresh, modern and relevant. And when it comes time to implement a change or execute a decision, a leader must do this with confidence. It can be easy to get stuck procrastinating or hung up on details, so keep this in mind: Results are what matter most in business, and there are no results without action. And action, of course, requires a plan. So, once you have a good and thoughtful plan – and a policy for what to do if it doesn’t work out – act on it! Even if it turns out to be a dud, it’ll probably prove better to have tried and failed than to have never tried at all. When you hear the word culture, you probably think about art and literature – or perhaps a biological sample. Yet there is such a thing as business culture; it refers to the social environment of a workplace, which is something every leader must tend with care. So another practice for successful leadership is to create an open work culture that allows your team to be as efficient as they can be. Some leaders are satisfied with having a team that puts in just enough effort to produce average work. The most successful leaders, however, will push and encourage their team to be the best they can be. If you push your team to work hard, you’ll get amazing results from those promising employees who get bored when they’re not being challenged. This is crucial, because a lack of inspiration anywhere in the team will spread like wildfire. All it takes is one bored person to damage the morale of the entire team. If you’re uncertain about how to properly motivate someone on the team, don’t be afraid to ask what kind of task he or she might find particularly challenging. Another tip that can increase efficiency is to reward team members who come up with ways to save time. Simplifying how your team can get things done and removing any obstacles that might be in the way is another important part of any leader’s job. A successful team is one that is able to perform at its best. It shouldn’t have to wrestle with outdated software, a slow internet connection or faulty computers and printers. So if your team needs new equipment or training in order to do a better job, it’s up to you, the leader, to spot this problem and fix it. Remember: The team is trying to reach the goal you’ve set. Any distractions or obstacles need to be removed. Also, keep an eye out for unnecessary paperwork or redundant procedures that might be slowing things down. Sometimes, the way things are being done can create problems. In the previous blinks, we touched briefly on motivation, but the importance of being a motivational leader can’t be understated. Motivation is what gets your team to be passionate about their work. It’s what will make them dedicated workers who can tackle the most difficult tasks. When your team is motivated, you’ll find there’s nothing they can’t do, whether it’s handling endless requests from the fussiest of clients or being creative enough to launch an app that makes learning calculus fun. So it’s the leader’s job to motivate their team and get them to care about the work they do. There are many ways to do this, but it’s especially important that each and every team member understands why their work is important so that they’re not just working for a paycheck. It’s also important to avoid micromanaging. Motivated employees need a sense of ownership, and they won’t feel that they own their work if you’re constantly telling them to do things your way. Micromanaging can also be an obstacle to action. You don’t want all your team members feeling like they need to get your permission before they do anything. Plus, don’t forget to celebrate the accomplishments your team makes. Instead of jumping from one goal to the next, throw a party when you meet a milestone or complete a big project! Another crucial part of leading a motivated and loyal team is to earn their respect. These days, it’s common for an employee to jump from one job to the next, hunting for the best-paid position at the most prestigious company. But this doesn’t mean that you can’t win the loyalty of a good employee. At the heart of a successful company is a feeling of mutual respect between the team and its leader. To establish this, you must first show them your respect, which you can do by regularly asking for their opinion and never dismissing their concerns. And to solidify their respect, always keep your promises and show solidarity by putting in just as much hard work as you ask of them. One of the most challenging aspects of being a leader is finding the time to manage your team without neglecting all the other work you have on your plate. This challenge is compounded by the fact that multitasking increases your chances of spending too much time on something that is ultimately unproductive. This is where prioritizing comes in. To sort out your work and make sure you’re doing what really needs to be done, adopt a triage mentality and rank your tasks by how important and productive they really are. Triage is more often used in a medical setting to make sure the sickest patients get treated first, but it applies perfectly to business as well. Just like sick patients, there are some tasks that need more urgent care than others, and there are certain projects that need to be dropped altogether. There are also disruptive activities that can seriously hurt your productivity, such as checking your email every few minutes. Every time your focus shifts to a new activity, you disrupt your workflow and waste time, because you then need to re-focus your attention back to the more important work. So be more efficient by de-prioritizing your email and setting specific times to visit your inbox. Another key practice is knowing when to cut off the amount of data you let in. You can spend a lifetime trying to educate yourself about a certain problem. This may feel like the only way to make an informed decision. But, in reality, our brain can only handle so much information before we become confused and distracted. So limit the time you spend gathering data and you’ll be more productive and make better decisions. Finally, don’t forget to take care of yourself. With so much going on, it can be easy to forget to prioritize your own health. Making decisions and solving problems can be just as tiring as physical labor. And mental overexertion can have some unpleasant side effects. People who are overworked and sleep deprived often feel burnt out, moody, sick and have trouble focusing. So remember to take breaks, have fun and get enough sleep. It’s not only good for your health; it’ll lead to being more productive and better leadership, too. The key message in this book: As an executive you are responsible for the environment in your company, and for the performance of your team. You are their leader, but you’ll find productivity only when you act like you’re a part of the team. That means establishing goals, being respectful and, perhaps most importantly, looking out for the team’s (and your own) well-being.  Actionable advice: Don’t overthink it. The next time you need to make an important decision and you’re torn between several options, don’t think too much. Simply compare the possible benefits and repercussions of every action, ask yourself what’s best for your team and business, listen to your gut – and act. What to read next: The Effective Executive, by Peter F. Drucker As we’ve just discovered, becoming a productive and effective leader isn’t easy. The steps outlined in these blinks will help you up your management game, but if you want to take your leadership skills even higher, you need to consult Peter F. Drucker, the ultimate authority in business leadership. In The Effective Executive – first published in 1967 – Drucker offers a step-by-step guide to becoming the best leader you can be. Millions of aspiring leaders, including Jeff Bezos, have benefitted from Drucker’s classic work, and you can too. Just head over to our blinks to The Effective Executive and discover the vital skills every great leader needs. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

It’s something every company, athletics club or theater group longs for. But far too often it seems an impossibility. And let’s not kid ourselves, working together with others can sometimes be pretty terrible. There is surely no more fear-inducing phrase in the English language than “team building exercises”. But there’s a reason why they exist. We all know that there’s much to be appreciated in a strong team. When something’s done well, we all benefit. But there’s no need to see the dream team as an elusive thing. There are some simple rules that can be applied to ensure that your team will be at its best. Shane Snow’s a great guide for this. His examples aren’t just dry recollections of company politics. Instead, he draws lessons from across the gamut of human history. It’s a lot of fun and it’s a great way to help those key rules stick in your head. In these blinks, then, we’ll take a closer look at the elements that make up a dream team and give you the ideas, concepts, and encouragement so you can go out and create one of your own. In this pack you’ll learn: which hip hop group you should aspire to be; how the Wright Brothers liked to settle arguments; and some basics of modern art appreciation. In 1974, the FBI was trying its hardest to serve a subpoena to a Mafia boss based out of Newark, New Jersey. In those days, the law was pretty clear: only if the subpoena was given directly and personally to somebody was it necessary for them to obey it and appear in court. So the Mafia boss came up with what he thought was a winning strategy: he surrounded himself with bodyguards. No subpoena-wielding FBI agent was going to get close to him! In the end, it was a young female agent, Chris Jung, who came up with a plan. She’d go undercover to the wedding of the Mafia boss’s daughter. She’d make out that she was one of the wedding guests and deliver the subpoena to the boss herself as he welcomed the guests. She was able to succeed because she was a woman in a male-dominated profession and so managed to achieve her goal without causing undue suspicion at the Mafia wedding. There are two lessons here. Firstly, generally speaking, diversity among team members will increase the chances of finding the right solution. Secondly, as Jung showed in this case, diversity can bring new ways of thinking to teams. Jung demonstrated that agency work didn’t have to be a show of strength and brawn. Disguise, intrigue and clever maneuvering could also reap rewards. These lessons don’t just apply to women in male-dominated teams. Gender and racial diversity within your team will add the kinds of perspectives that foster problem solving. That’s because your lived experiences shape the way you see the world, the way you think and, ultimately, the way you solve problems. A greater range of diverse opinions from different backgrounds will challenge people to re-evaluate entrenched perspectives and prejudices. In 2013, four different US universities invited around 200 people who self-identified as either Democrats or Republicans. They were to participate in a murder mystery scenario. Interestingly, even though the scenario didn’t involve politics at all, when the participants were told they'd be explaining their solution to the murder mystery game to people of opposing party allegiances, they prepared themselves better and worked on stronger arguments. The study showed another benefit of diversity: if a team is more diverse, the decisions that are presented will have been strength-tested for success. Have you ever wondered how it is that couples who argue all the time somehow stay together for years? Well, according to experts at the Gottman Institute, a research center that examines couples' relationships, frequent arguments aren't actually an indicator of long-term problems. What’s much worse is when partners stop talking to one another. Conflict is a sign that people are prepared to find a solution. On the other hand, silence can lead to serious issues if problems are left unresolved. The same is true of companies. Organizational silence can result in problems down the line. Let’s look at an example in the auto industry. In 1998, the Detroit-based Chrysler and the German car manufacturer Daimler, who owned Mercedes-Benz and Maybach, set up a merger of their companies. Three years in, DaimlerChrysler was worth only half of what it had been at the time of the merger. The venture had been a massive failure. Interestingly, the cultural differences between the two businesses didn’t result in DaimlerChrysler becoming an amalgam of the two companies’ best practices. Instead, conflict arose between the quality-oriented former Daimler employees and the utility-oriented Chrysler workers. This phenomenon is known as cognitive friction. Discussion was not encouraged between the two sets of employees, creating an environment in which each kept to their own and the groups rarely interacted. The result was organizational silence. This isn’t to say conflict in and of itself is necessarily a bad thing. Just look at the Wu-Tang Clan, arguably one of the greatest hip hop groups of all time. They put their differences to good use. The posse formed in the 1990s and was comprised of musicians of different characters, ages and musical influences. The Wu-Tang Clan capitalized on its internal differences, moving the whole genre forward with groundbreaking lyrics and beats. However, a point will always come when tension and conflict no longer help to stimulate discussion and ideas. The whole thing can dissolve into toxic animosity. The famous aviation pioneers, the Wright brothers, knew the risks of this too well. They had an interesting strategy to avoid full-blown hostilities. They’d actually swap sides during arguments and try to argue each other’s points. That way they could detach, resasses their own natural stubbornness, and argue against the points rather than the person. The Wright brothers’ strategy for achieving harmony worked well for them, but it’s not easily scaled up to groups with more deep-seated animosities. For instance, at the turn of the twentieth century, many of the different communities in Buenos Aires were at loggerheads. Neighborhoods were never going to switch perspectives en masse like the Wright brothers did. But here’s something that did work: soccer! Argentinian national identity was evolving. The country used to see itself as one made up of rugged cowboy-like gauchos. Now it was dominated by pibes, kids who loved playing soccer on the streets. And kicking a ball around was something all kids could do too, regardless of race, religion or social class. This was particularly important to the Jewish community, who were facing particular difficulties in the city at the time. The soccer scene exploded. There were games on the streets and in the stadiums. Buenos Aires itself boasted a huge number of soccer teams. And, critically, when people played together, the animosities between different groups of Argentine society diminished. That might seem odd, but there are good reasons for it. Research shows that playing together makes the individuals see the other participants – irrespective of what side they are on – as part of the ‘in-group’. You feel less threatened by your opponents and actually more empathetic toward them. The brain tends to divide people either into ‘in-groups’ or 'out-groups’. That is, there are people who are similar to you whom you can trust, and there are people toward whom you’re more likely to harbor suspicious feelings. The part of the brain responsible for this division is the amygdala. When it identifies suspicious people, it triggers increased levels of adrenaline, sending alarm signals to other parts of the brain and body. The body’s heart rate and blood pressure will increase when this happens. It only takes something a little out of the ordinary to set off this response, even if it’s just hearing a foreign language or seeing someone acting a little strangely. In fact, it’s this chemical reaction that is the scientific basis for xenophobia. But we don’t have to let our bodies’ chemistry guide us. If people play together – as they did in Argentina – they’ll trust one another more. The result will be that in-groups expand and people will simply get along better. It has become fairly common in business circles to quote the adage, \"Don’t change a winning team.” On the surface it may make a lot of sense, but teams that have achieved success in the past often get stuck in their ways. That’s because whenever a team has been successful before, the tendency is to keep soldiering on in the exact same way. Innovation quickly becomes stagnation. Take the example of a company we’ll call G-Corp. In the 1980s it struck gold. It invented the successful blister cushion. Essentially, it was a bandage that released medication into a blister over a given time period. But, after this initial success, the company’s sales started to decline. Its fresh ideas weren’t nearly as good as the blister cushion. It failed to attract new customers. They were therefore forced to change what had once been a winning team. G-Corp’s executives hired the consultants Sense Worldwide who helped them expand the market for their products. It was a shock to the system, but it was needed. The team was able to move forward. Sense Worldwide began by setting up focus groups to help the executives understand the needs of their customer base. The focus groups were made up of people working in professions that were particularly susceptible to blisters. The executives were then made to draw a circle around the blisters on the feet of the focus group members with a permanent marker and then discuss the members’ needs with them. As a result, G-Corp came up with a new line of plaster-type products. There would be different shapes and thicknesses of plaster for different blisters, according to their severity. One final way to change up a team to enhance success, is to introduce someone into it who challenges the views of the others. In an experiment in 2009, American students were instructed to solve a murder mystery in teams of three. Yes, another murderous study – different to the one we mentioned in blink one! After 20 minutes, they were joined by a fourth member, the devil’s advocate. It was shown that the introduction of this new member doubled a group’s chances of solving the mystery. It wasn’t that the new person brought them the right answer. Rather the group was forced to consider its choice and test its argument against cross-examination. One particularly dismal March, the author headed to the Tretyakov Gallery to look at a groundbreaking painting. But he was left cold when he stood before it. The picture in question was Kazimir Malevich’s Black Square. It was painted at the start of the twentieth century, and it’s quite literally a small square canvas painted black. But the true significance of this painting lies in the story behind it. Prior to Malevich’s Black Square, art tended to portray reality and beauty. Even artists such as Picasso tried to capture a sort of reality, however distorted it can appear at first. Black Square freed art of the need to portray reality and reality alone. Art could become a vehicle for enriched visual communication and cognitive expansion. Art could be free. One of Malevich’s students, El Lissitzky, put these ideas into action. He designed propaganda posters for the Communists in Russia. Interestingly, when he realized the sort of power artists have to influence the masses, it proved too much. Consequently, Lissitzky, along with many other artists, fled for Germany in the 1920s. It was these artists who founded the now famous Bauhaus, an art movement that redefined the role of artistic function within global industry and advertising. This goes to show that it doesn’t really matter whether or not you like an original idea like the Black Square on initial viewing. Good ideas will still go on to have a long-lasting impact and influence. Don’t dismiss a possible solution before it’s fully formed. But there’s the other side of the coin: remember that good can come from bad ideas, even if they’re very unpopular. Take the idea that city planners in freezing Winooski, Vermont came up with in 1979. They wanted to reduce the town’s ever-increasing heating bill by covering the town with a dome through federal funds. Unsurprisingly, this wacky idea started gaining nationwide coverage, and was ridiculed from all sides of the political spectrum. It even earned an intervention from President Jimmy Carter, who gave orders to stop the dome’s construction. But the bad idea actually helped the town in the long run. Thanks to Winooski’s increased media profile, it managed to secure funding for a new hydroelectric plant nearby. Incredibly, it was the second largest funding amount per capita in the history of the US. The town was able to heat itself more economically and it all happened because one bad idea got tongues wagging. When you think about it, the Communist authoritarian Soviet Union was an unusual ally for the capitalist democracies of the West during the Second World War. But when faced with the existential threat of Hitler’s forces, they put aside their differences and put their minds to the task at hand. There’s a broader lesson in this. Superordinate goals unite people from different backgrounds who have quite different ideas. An even more extreme version of this occured in the War of 1812. The British were planning to take back the newly independent USA. They planned to send military vessels up the Mississippi river, but the port city of New Orleans stood in their way. The American general, Andrew Jackson, was struggling to match British troop numbers and so was forced to muster up not only his own trained cavalry, but also African American militia, pirates, volunteers with hatchets and hunting rifles and even prostitutes. Jackson was not a tolerant man and despised his new troops. The feeling was mutual. Nonetheless, they set aside their differences and concentrated on their superordinate goal: to defend the country against the British troops. Incredibly, in 1815, this mob of unlikely comrades beat the British back and saved the country from a full invasion. However, the truce between these groups was not to last. Soon after the battle old animosities resurfaced, as signalled by the State of Louisiana attempting to reclaim pirates’ property. The truth was, though their success had been a great one, the differences between the groups were simply too absolute to be overcome completely. But it’s not impossible to avoid dissolution. Unity can be preserved if a culture of teamwork and mutual respect is nurtured. In 1954, an experiment was conducted at a boys' summer camp. The children were divided into two groups, the Rattlers and the Eagles, and they quickly came to loathe each other. However, they were given a series of challenges that forced them to compromise. They had to deal with a compromised water supply and the breakdown of the camp truck during a lake expedition. After the first challenge, the groups quickly reverted to the norm of hating each other. But as they were given more challenges and collaborated more frequently, they began trusting each other’s intentions. They started to empathize. And so a deeper sense of respect for the other group was cultivated. By the last day of camp, the old animosities had vanished. They sat together in the cafeteria irrespective of what group they were part of and sang merrily together on the bus ride back home. It sounds like a swell summer! In the 1950s and early 1960s, the famed civil rights activist Malcolm X was a controversial figure, to put it bluntly. Not only was he a member of the radical Nation of Islam, but his bad experiences with white people in America in his younger years also led him to a radical conclusion. For him, integration was an impossible goal, and so he advocated that black and white communities should be kept separate. This story encapsulates what years of research have shown. Namely, many of our opinions are the result of our brains interpolating belief based on our previous experiences. But there is a way out, as Malcolm X later discovered. If you're put in a strange environment, you’ll tend to reassess your intellectual standpoint with humility. Research shows that if you immerse yourself in a different culture you will become more receptive to new ideas. As you move out of your comfort zone you'll see the world from a new perspective, one that is dissociated from your individual identity. Thus profound changes of heart become more likely. What made Malcolm X finally change his ideas about separatism was his pilgrimage to Mecca in 1964 and the subsequent time he spent in Africa. All that assisted him in developing a new multicultural perspective. He saw different cultures, where people of different ethnicities lived together in harmony. It convinced him that this was also possible in the US. But ressassment doesn't come from nowhere. You have to be prepared to approach intellectual arguments with humility and recognize any predetermined allegiances or prejudices you might hold. Only then will you be able to value discussion and arguments based on their rational merits alone. Malcolm X therefore exemplifies this intellectual humility in action. He was able to reconsider his entrenched opinions and reassess them. The lesson of intellectual humility holds true for teams as well as for individuals. While it’s self evident that a diversity of opinions in a group will increase the chances that the right solution will be somewhere in the mix, it doesn’t necessarily mean that the right solution will be the one that is settled on. This is where intellectual humility comes in. If people are willing and able to reconsider their opinions, then it’s more likely that a difference of opinions will result in rational debate. And if people are able to debate rationally, then it’s more likely that the right answer will be chosen. So far we’ve seen how intellectual humility, lively discussions, regulated dissent and common goals all help in creating a dream team. But there’s more that can be done. When team members hear colleagues’ life stories, it elicits empathy. Teams therefore improve as members better understand one another. A series of experiments conducted by Paul Zak of Claremont University looked into oxytocin production in participants under certain conditions. Oxytocin is important as it’s the hormone that’s produced when we experience trust or kindness, making us more empathetic toward one another. Zak demonstrated that when people were shown charity advertisements that relayed cancer patients’ stories or abuse suffered by pets at animal shelters, the participants’ bodies produced much more oxytocin than when shown ads that conveyed statistics about cancer patients or animal abuse. They were also more likely to donate money after seeing the story-based ads than the stat-based ads. There's a reason for this. Stories make us relate to one another much better than dry numbers. It's simply much easier to put ourselves empathetically in their shoes. The effect can be scaled up too: people’s stories have been front and center of some of the most important social justice milestones to date. Take the examples of Asian Americans and gay people in America. Attitudes toward these two groups changed significantly over the course of the last century. During the Second World War, Asian Americans were some of the most negatively stereotyped minorities in the country. And after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour in 1941, over 120,000 Asian Americans were put into prison camps, supposedly because they were all potentially capable of conspiring with a foreign power. Eventually, positive characters in film and on TV helped people relate more to Asian Americans. One such character was Hikaru Sulu in Star Trek. He was eloquent, and so challenged racial stereotypes. It was a similar story with homosexuality. Over 50 percent of Americans in the 1950s believed that homosexual activity was criminal and warranted jail time. But when gay people started bravely coming out, and sharing their stories en masse, attitudes began to change. All it can take is a bit of sharing and empathy for things to work out for the better. Dream teams can be difficult to assemble and to maintain. But a good mix of diversity, provocation, intellectual humility and compassion will see you through in the end. It's definitely worth the effort. The key message in these blinks: Many of us have witnessed those moments when, as working as part of a team, everything comes together and something lasting is produced. What’s more, the result can be greater than the work of any one individual. However, most of the time, teamwork is frustrating. We can be left thinking that going it alone was best. But that’s not true! If we’re respectful, empathetic, open-minded, ready to be challenged and willing to listen to dissent, then a true dream team can emerge and achieve the very best results. Actionable advice: Reverse roles. Next time your team is stuck in an argument where neither of the sides is willing to compromise, suggest switching sides. If you’re forced to argue for the idea you were arguing against, you’ll find this will not only ease the tension, but also make everyone see the benefits of both ideas more clearly. The right solution won’t be far away. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Jobs like coal mining or construction are known to be physically damaging to our health, and regulations have been put in place to limit their adverse effects. But what’s often ignored is the mental health of white-collar workers. Stress from overwork, unemployment or lack of job control has been proven to affect health negatively. From increased chances of heart attacks to higher rates of depression, the modern workplace is putting unneeded stress on millions of Americans. It doesn’t have to be this way. Employers need to institute positive change in the workplace to make sure their employees are living happy, healthy lives. And what’s more, this results in a win-win situation; healthy workers mean increased productivity and higher profits. In these blinks, you’ll discover what the mayor of San Francisco did to lower emergency room admissions; why layoffs are bad for both employees and employers; and how the American healthcare system is different from those of other highly developed nations. Most of us have experienced stress in the workplace. The statistics agree. In fact, studies show that workplace stress is getting increasingly worse and shows no sign of abating. The American Institute of Stress reported that a staggering 80 percent of Americans experience regular stress at work. But if workplace stress is such a widespread phenomenon, then what are the consequences? In short, work can be detrimental to one’s health. For example, according to Fortune magazine, Salesforce is meant to be one of the best companies to work for in the United States. But numerous anecdotal reports from employees show a different side to the company. One unnamed employee who joined the company as a manager was soon compelled to take antidepressants to cope with the stressful work environment. Her constantly changing schedule and demanding job meant she often had to work – or travel for work – on weekends. To cope with all this, she ended up spending around $2,000 a month on therapy and a personal trainer. But not everyone can afford such coping techniques, particularly in the fast-growing gig economy. The gig economy is characterized by precarious short-term contracts and often low wages; some have predicted that 40 percent of the American workforce will be gig economy workers by 2020. The economic uncertainty of such work, combined with little to no paid time off, led to a review of 93 studies concluding that gig-economy work leads to decreased safety on the job, as well as a decline in workers’ overall health. But things don’t have to be this way. An inspiring example of companies trying to do things differently is Aetna. After CEO Mark Bertolini suffered a terrible skiing accident in 2004, he developed an interest in health. This made him rethink his company’s attitude to employee well-being. In 2015, Aetna instituted a minimum hourly wage of $16, leading to a 33 percent pay increase for the company’s lowest earners. This, combined with improved employee health insurance and free meditation classes, led to employees reporting 28 percent less stress and 20 percent better quality of sleep. What’s more, the company’s healthcare costs decreased, showing that caring about employees’ well-being can result in a win-win situation on both sides of the paycheck. Sadly, companies like Aetna are few and far between. As we’ll see in the blinks that follow, workplace stress extracts an enormous toll on people worldwide. Everyone knows that secondhand smoke is unhealthy. Because of this, smoking in public places such as restaurants is increasingly forbidden in the United States. Disturbingly, the author’s research team found that workplace-induced stress is just as deadly as inhaling carcinogenic secondhand smoke. So why aren’t policymakers legislating against this deadly trend? Workplace stress in the United States is actually the fifth-highest cause of death, amounting to 120,000 preventable deaths every year. After careful analysis of data relating to public health and workplace conditions, the author and his research collaborators arrived at this troubling figure. But how does workplace stress contribute to so much suffering? This is partly because in the United States work isn’t just the place where people spend time to earn money, it’s also usually where many get their health insurance. This means that at least 85,000 of these 120,000 deaths are due to a lack of health insurance, whether via unemployment, freelance work or simply a lack of employer-provided coverage. For those in employment, an estimated 28,000 deaths are due to stress from overwork, lack of job control or social support in the workplace. Causes include global competition leading to increased working hours. The growth of mobile technology also means employees are increasingly expected to be “online” and work outside office hours. All of this increased stress affects our physical health, with numerous studies showing the link between stress and disease. In men, for example, stress leads to heightened chances of many types of cancer. Monetarily speaking, the price of stressful workplace practices led to $190 billion in excess mental healthcare costs or about 8 percent of total US healthcare expenditure. At least half of these deaths could be avoided if the United States were to adopt a policy similar to its highly developed European counterparts. In fact, workplace deaths are half as common in Europe as they are in America. Why? Because Europe’s highly developed countries tend to spend more money on healthcare as they get richer, leading to better health and lower levels of deaths caused by one’s environment – including workplaces. So if the United States were to align itself closer to European workplace regulation and healthcare systems, the country would be able to avoid 60,000 deaths – and about $63 billion in healthcare costs. When ArcelorMittal acquired bankrupt Bethlehem Steel in 2008, the new owners decided to shut down its New York plant. This meant the plant’s 260 workers were all laid off. Three weeks later, tragedy struck: a 56-year-old ex-employee, George Kull, had a heart attack and died. His 55-year-old coworker Don Turner suffered the same fate directly after. He’d worked at the plant for decades. Such tragic events are a direct result of layoffs and the economic insecurity and subsequent mental health issues they induce. Countless studies in developed countries show a similar trend backed by strong empirical evidence: layoffs result in people dying. One such study of 13,000 American adults who suffered heart attacks from 1992 to 2010 found that nearly 70 percent of cases occurred after job loss. What’s more, those who’d suffered more than four job losses in the period had a 63 percent higher chance of having a heart attack than those who had not. The same trend can even be found in other highly developed nations. For example, a Swedish study followed employees laid off by companies that shuttered their doors between 1987 and 1988. They found that in the four years after losing their jobs, suicide rates in the sample doubled. Another Swedish study found that 20 weeks into unemployment, the alcohol consumption of those laid off rose by 400 percent. The tragic irony of all this? Companies themselves also lose out as a result of layoffs. The costs of layoffs are many – severance pay, possible lawsuits, decreased morale of those not laid off, and lessening productivity. Aside from these costs, layoffs don’t even fix the underlying issue facing businesses: it’s not excessive costs that are the problem, but lack of revenue. And layoff announcements often correlate to stock prices dropping; this should hardly be surprising, as layoffs imply companies are very clearly not in the best shape. So what’s the alternative? Well, take the US airspace closure that occurred after 9/11. Practically all major airlines began laying off employees – 80,000 in total – to counter the lost revenue. But one airline stood out: Southwest. Instead of laying off employees, they gave out refunds to all customers who wanted them and even kept a promise to pay out $179 million into a workers’ profit-sharing plan. At the end of 2001, Southwest was in great shape. Not only did it have a profitable year, but by 2002, its market capitalization was also larger than the rest of the industry put together! All highly developed nations have enshrined healthcare as a fundamental human right that should not be left to competitive markets. That is, all highly developed nations except the United States. Tragically, an estimated 50,000 people die yearly in the United States because they do not have access to – or cannot afford – healthcare. Just take women suffering from breast cancer, for example. A study showed that when uninsured, their chances of not surviving the disease jump by a hefty 49 percent. And a long-term study of 9,000 Americans of all ages between 1988 and 2000 showed that anyone uninsured has a 40 percent higher risk of dying. Casino workers in Atlantic City are another example group. Since 2011, the city has shed half of its casino jobs. Worse, many of the remaining jobs have had their associated healthcare canceled or reduced, with employers citing financial problems. A survey commissioned by an Atlantic City casino workers’ union found that 72 percent of its workers were having trouble paying their bills due to high health-insurance costs, and half had developed symptoms of depression. Sadly, decreasing employee-provided healthcare coverage is a trend that shows no sign of abating. As health insurance gets more and more expensive, more employers cannot afford to offer it to their employees. In 2011, 40 percent of employers were not providing insurance to employees, up from 30 percent in 2000. And even when employers do provide coverage, employee contributions went up threefold from 2001 to 2011, from $355 to $921 per year. In such grim circumstances, what can companies do to make sure their workers are healthy while keeping up profitability? After all, it’s not just that healthy employees are more productive. Companies that show they care about their employees also inspire loyalty and engagement, and increase job retention. In the absence of a huge policy shift toward universalized healthcare and away from competitive health insurance markets, companies can provide on-site doctors. This bypasses the need to deal with pricey insurance companies, thereby guaranteeing cheap and efficient coverage for employers and reduced-cost – or even free – coverage for employees. Companies as small as 400 employees have switched to this system and found that it has reduced absenteeism and allowed for earlier prevention of disease. Employee perks are all the rage these days. Whether it’s onsite free alcohol or games rooms, Silicon Valley-inspired perks are increasingly found in modern offices. But such amenities are often superficial and cannot alone resolve the high levels of stress found in the workplace. Real workplace change takes time and effort. An important factor contributing to employee happiness is having control over one’s work life. This was demonstrated in the 1970s when British researchers discovered differences in civil servants’ chances of getting heart disease. They found that higher-ranked civil servants were 50 percent less likely to report chest pain. This correlated directly to the amount of control they were given within their jobs, with higher-ranked civil servants having more choice over what they worked on and how and when they did it. In fact, lacking control in one’s job can lead to people feeling helpless. When, say, a popular manager at a company is fired, and no reason is given, employees feel higher levels of stress as they have no control over the negative situation. Indeed, an Indiana University study found that those in stressful, demanding jobs with low levels of control had a 15.5 percent increased risk of death. But things don’t have to be like this. Take outdoor fashion giant Patagonia, for example. The company employs flat organizational structures that don’t allow space for micromanagement. When the weather is good outside, employees are encouraged to take hours off work to enjoy outdoor sports. Such a workplace philosophy allows them to work when and how they want. Social support in the workplace is as important in guaranteeing employee health. Research has consistently shown that having a strong social support network of close friends is good for one’s health. But how can workplaces contribute to such sentiments? First, companies should avoid ranked performance reviews of their employees. These force employees to compete with one another, increasing infighting and decreasing collaboration. Secondly, invest in long-term relationships with employees. Google did so in 2011 when they announced a radical life-insurance scheme for employees and their families. Upon the passing of an employee, the family would receive all the employee’s unvested stock and half of their salary for ten years. Such actions inspire a sense of community in the workplace, relieve employees of stress and increase psychological health. As has been shown, there are plenty of obvious reasons why companies should treat their employees like family. Healthy employees are more productive, more loyal and live longer lives. But what can we do to change the current situation where profits are prioritized over employees’ happiness? Firstly, start measuring employee happiness. This can be done via employees self-reporting their health. Simply pose a straightforward question regularly to employees: “How good is your health in general?” A Finnish study of 2,800 respondents found that when they self-reported their health for one year, it correlated to visits to their doctor. By encouraging self-reporting, companies can therefore best keep track of just when employees are unwell. Knowing when employees are feeling sick or down can help businesses adjust workplace conditions accordingly. Secondly, toxic companies need to be publicly called out. In the same way that companies that treat the environment badly are increasingly called out as polluters, so should the social pollution of an unhealthy workplace be made public. By being called out, companies would be incentivized to make their workplaces healthier. No company wants to be branded as bad for human health. Finally, companies should be forced to pay the health costs for which they are responsible. Take Walmart, for example. The company’s low wages and patchy health insurance take their toll on their employees’ well-being. Their policy also forces employees to rely on public healthcare, the cost of which Walmart doesn’t have to bear. One study estimated that Walmart employees had public health expenditure amounting to $455 million yearly. To alleviate this shifting of expenses to the taxpayer, companies should be forced to pay out a minimum proportion of employee healthcare costs. San Francisco did just that in 2007, legislating that employers had to contribute $1.37 per hour per employee for healthcare. The result? Emergency room costs were hugely reduced, as employees were able to better prevent sickness in primary care rather than at the last minute. At the end of the day, employers and policymakers must realize that there is a moral issue at stake. A hundred and twenty thousand people per year are literally dying for a paycheck so that companies can make more money. And if people are dying because of work, they are being robbed of their dignity. This needs to change. The key message in these blinks: Around 120,000 Americans are dying every year because of job stress. The US health insurance system places an unfair burden of health costs onto employees rather than employers, causing many Americans to be uninsured, pay huge medical bills or even die. The same goes for layoffs, which lead to a myriad of health problems. But by giving employees more control over their work, together with increased social support, a healthier workplace environment can be fostered. Combine that with shifting medical costs onto employers rather than employees, and we can hopefully reduce the number of work-related deaths in years to come. Actionable advice: Accept that there is no trade-off between employee well-being and profitability. These go hand in hand. Healthier employees mean increased productivity and loyalty, in addition to decreased turnover rates. Spending more on healthcare for employees results in lower costs for employers, as healthy employees are less prone to absenteeism and extended stints in the hospital. And, of course, morally speaking, if more companies took better care of their employees, fewer employees would suffer from workplace-related illnesses or even death. Got feedback?

It allows us to engage in competition, convince others of our strengths and surpass our past achievements. All too often, however, when we experience success, our ego becomes inflated. Our perception can get clouded as our self-image rises above our view of others. We can become so confident that we overextend ourselves and end up paying for it. So, taming our pride is a crucial step – but how do we do that? In these blinks, you’ll learn where ego comes from and how it can block your road to success. You’ll pick up strategies for how to control your ego, regain humility and forgo seeking praise in favor of sharing it with others. You’ll also find out why US president Ulysses S. Grant was a great egoist; how Metallica guitarist Kirk Hammett kept his ego in check; and why the New England Patriots didn’t congratulate themselves for finding one of the best quarterbacks of all time. As the saying goes, actions speak louder than words. But if that’s true, why do we love to feel popular or get praise from others, even for things we haven’t done? We’ve got our ego to thank for that. Ego is the desire to get fame and recognition without doing the good deeds that are required for us to deserve it. While recognition may result from being successful, many people try to become famous before they achieve success. Consider the story of former US president Ulysses S. Grant, once a well-known general in the US Army. After the American Civil War, he ran for president and won. But while Grant may have been popular in the army, he didn’t have much experience in the political sphere. His desire to win the highest political office despite his lack of experience makes Grant the perfect example of an egoist. Unlike ego, ambition is based on a solid foundation of real achievements. Take the example of William Tecumseh Sherman, a general serving in the military alongside Grant. Sherman was also successful in his post, but, unlike Grant, he wasn’t an egoist. As the end of Abraham Lincoln's second term drew near, Grant and other egoistic military leaders were determined to use their reputations to push into politics and compete for the role of president.   Sherman, on the other hand, was ambitious. While egoists chase after fame, ambitious people are driven by the will to excel in their field, regardless of whether they are congratulated and celebrated for their successes. During talks with Lincoln, it became clear that Sherman simply wasn’t interested in becoming president. He preferred to keep working hard in his field of expertise: military leadership. He was determined to be successful without focusing on gaining recognition for it, and he also knew that success in one field didn’t necessarily mean it could be transferred over to others. Ancient Greek philosopher Epictetus once said, “It is impossible to learn that which one thinks one already knows.” This, again, relates to our ego. Our ego tells us that we’re too clever to learn anything new, and while this assumption is a stubborn one, we can overcome it if we learn to humble ourselves. One way we can control our ego is by thinking of ourselves as students that never stop learning. Even if you’re incredibly good at what you do, your ego can get the better of you all too easily. You can prevent this by reminding yourself that there’s always someone who’s better than you. Take guitarist Kirk Hammett. In 1980, he was asked by Metallica to join their band, where his musical talent would be allowed to shine. But Hammett knew that even though he’d just become a member of one of the most famous rock bands of all time, he wasn’t done learning. Hammett became a student of world-renowned guitar virtuoso Joe Satriani and, in doing so, was able to take his guitar skills to a whole new level. Hammett was able to stay humble by working with an immensely talented peer, which is one of the best ways to rein in your ego. If you want to remind yourself that you’ve always got more to learn, you can find yourself a highly-skilled mentor. But working with someone more talented isn’t the only way to stay grounded; you can also become a teacher. This is a strategy applied by martial-arts expert Frank Shamrock. He believes that in order stay humble, fighters must not only learn from the very best and train with peers at their skill level, but should also dedicate time to training beginners. This allows fighters to see the full spectrum of skill levels in their sport, while also keeping their ego in check. Imagine what would happen if some of the world's greatest inventors let their early achievements get to their heads. What if, for instance, Steve Jobs had rested on his laurels after creating the Apple II computer? Well, we likely wouldn’t have iPhones or iPads today. So why is it that we tend to sit back and relax after achieving success? Resting on our laurels is a result of our pride. Pride and ego aren’t the same thing, but they definitely go hand-in-hand. Pride helps us justify our ego, making us feel like a single success is a sign of how special we are. We’re too busy patting ourselves on the back to see that there’s room for improvement, or that we could achieve even greater things. Pride doesn’t just stop us from continuing to learn and achieve, it also makes us overly sensitive to criticism and deaf to warnings. Proud people are very prone to becoming defensive – or even aggressive – if someone tells them they aren’t as special as they think they are, because their ego rests on this falsehood. Rather than face the fact that we’re not the best in the world at what we do, many of us are more willing to fight anything that hurts our pride and ego. Even Benjamin Franklin got caught up in his own pride at one point. While visiting his hometown of Boston, one of the town’s most respected figures, Cotton Mather, called out to him, shouting “Stoop! Stoop!” Franklin seemed to think he was above this gesture and ignored him, which was a foolish move – he walked straight into a low door-frame, knocking his head painfully! If we want to see past the blinkers of pride, we should consider, in every situation, how someone more humble would perceive things. Do you have trouble trusting teammates or coworkers? Ever feel like you can’t give them tasks to do because they just wouldn’t do as good a job as you? These are some serious signs that your ego needs reining in. Try placing trust in other people’s work – you and your team will benefit from it. As you move up your career ladder and take on more of a managerial role, conflicts with your ego may emerge. You might have been used to gaining recognition for your work, while your new role might be to oversee the work of others. Many of us tend to hoard tasks we should really be delegating. Why? Because our ego tells us that we’re the only ones who can do them right. By practicing delegation, you’ll force yourself to trust and respect the work of others. You’ll learn that other people’s time might actually be put to better use on the tasks that you used to do, and you’ll also see how useful your time can be when dedicated to new things. If that’s not enough to convince you, keep in mind that the the costs of refusing to delegate can be pretty hefty; in fact, they can be enough to devastate any business. Take the story of car manufacturer John DeLorean. He left his job at General Motors to start his own company because he believed he had a better understanding of the car manufacturing business than his bosses at GM. The problem was, he had no substance or expertise to back up his assumption, and this soon became painfully clear. In his new company, he eschewed the stable top-down responsibility structures that made GM thrive. Instead, DeLorean – and his ego – had to have a say in every single decision, a dictatorial style of management that was unsustainable, to say the least. DeLorean’s endeavor eventually failed, ending in bankruptcy. No person is an island. So why do we love to think of our victories as ours alone? Whether we achieve success after tackling adversity or just through hard work, it’s far too easy to let accomplishments go to our heads and let ourselves believe they were all our own doing. Take basketball players Shaquille O’Neal and Kobe Bryant. Both were world-class players with the LA Lakers, and won three consecutive championships with the Lakers in 2000, 2001 and 2002. They were a fantastic duo but, unfortunately, they both let their individual success get to their heads. O’Neal often complained about Bryant’s shortcomings to the media, and Bryant refused to sign with the Lakers again until they traded O’Neal to another team. What would you do in the same position? If you are suddenly asked for an interview by a magazine or gain hordes of followers on social media, it might be easy to think that you’re better than the peers who helped you along the way. Rather than selfishly seeking out praise for yourself, why not share the accolades with others? Usually, they’ll do the same for you in return. Of course, some careers rely on the popularity of an individual, whether it’s in the form of broad readership or constant media coverage. But showing humility will always benefit your career, no matter what. From the accountants who gave you the numbers for that winning presentation to the designer who made those striking infographics, thanking those who help you along the way will strengthen your own position. Your team will enjoy working with you and will perform better, and you’ll continue attracting new coworkers, too. If one of your great ideas gets rejected or you don’t get the job you applied for, it’s natural to feel frustrated. After all, our egos tell us that we’re entitled to receive rewards – but the world doesn’t always work in accordance with our plans. Sometimes, we don’t get a promotion or close a sure deal, even though we did our best. So how do we confront this? Rather than feeling disappointed, we can start by acknowledging the work we’ve done and recognize that we can’t always control the outcome of that work, or people’s opinions of us. An unexpected result should be welcomed as an opportunity to honestly reflect on our performance. And on the other side, we should remember that lucky breaks are not the same as success that comes from hard work. So, again, we have to be honest with ourselves about our performance. Take the example of the New England Patriots football team. They selected Tom Brady in the sixth round of an entry draft, and he turned out to be one of the greatest quarterbacks in NFL history, leading the Patriots to four Super Bowl titles. However, instead of congratulating themselves for having found such a great player in such unexpected circumstances, the Patriots were determined to improve their scouting program, so they would identify talent like Tom Brady again. The next time something doesn’t go the way you expect it to, take the time to understand why. Improve your best efforts and you’ll give yourself a better chance in the future. The key message in this book: An ego is not something a person develops on purpose; it is a part of everyone’s personality that develops naturally, especially in conjunction with success. An unchecked ego can end up being detrimental to your success, and you should take careful steps to ensure that it doesn’t get out of control. Got feedback?

Perhaps that seems like an odd matchup, but, in fact, these things are intricately connected – at least, they are if you want to be a successful project manager. But do you know how to combine these things? Well, this is exactly what these blinks seek to teach you. Read on, and enhance your abilities as a project manager by learning all about concepts related to emotional intelligence, including self- and social awareness as well as self- and relationship management. In these blinks, you’ll discover why emotional intelligence is especially important for project managers; the wisdom of setting emotional boundaries; and how to build strong relationships with your stakeholders. Have you ever felt like your workplace was stifling your emotions? If so, you certainly aren’t alone. A lot of project managers deliberately try to create an emotion-free work environment. That, however, is a big mistake. Positive emotions (and even some negative ones!) can actually help in the workplace. A bit of emotional intelligence can help lead a project to success. Emotional intelligence, a term popularized by Daniel Goleman’s 1995 best seller, Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ, refers to our ability not only to identify emotions in ourselves and others, but to use those emotions to guide our behavior. For project managers, emotional intelligence should be geared toward improving work performance. Emotional intelligence is very powerful. In fact, one study of the relationship between IQ, emotional intelligence and project managers found that a manager’s emotional intelligence often correlated with a project’s success, whereas there was no correlation between success and IQ. And emotional intelligence isn’t only critical for managing your project – it gives you a competitive advantage as a manager, too! Emotional intelligence allows project managers to develop positive relationships with their team members and stakeholders, and it can give them the edge on competition, too. If you’re good at working with people, you’ll set yourself apart from other managers, and therefore get better projects and more chances to use and develop your emotional skills And the competition is rising! Every year, more and more people try to get their PMP (Project Management Professional) certificate. In 1995, only 4,410 people took the test; in 2011, 500,000 took it! In this increasingly competitive work environment, you need to make yourself stand out in any way you can. Emotional intelligence can do a lot in this regard. Self-awareness is the base of emotional intelligence. It refers to your ability to recognize your own emotions and the effect they have on those around you. And it comprises three components: emotional self-awareness, self-assessment and self-confidence. Emotional self-awareness is about understanding your own feelings. This is often a challenge. Luckily, you can use the SASHET framework to identify those elusive or frightening emotions. Emotions are always in flux, making them distinctly difficult to pin down and analyze. Moreover, many of us were raised in emotionally unhealthy environments and thus struggle to come to terms with our negative emotions in adulthood. Early on, the author learned to suppress his emotions, which, if expressed, would often set off his alcoholic father. And this early habit carried over into adulthood. That’s why the SASHET framework is useful. SASHET stands for the six families of emotion: Sad, Angry, Scared, Happy, Excited and Tender. Those six families are further subdivided into many other emotions, but it’s a good start if you can identify which family you’re in at any given moment. The next step in achieving self-awareness is to master self-assessment, the ability to pinpoint and explore your own strengths and weaknesses. Self-assessment is also about listening to feedback about yourself and your behavior, and adjusting yourself accordingly. Finally, work on your self-confidence. Self-confidence, which builds off self-assessment, is about being able to maintain your composure, no matter the situation. A person with high self-confidence is centered at all times. When you’re truly self-confident, you essentially understand yourself so well that you’re no longer affected when others doubt you. Naturally, as a project manager, you manage other people all the time. But have you ever thought about managing yourself? Self-management is an integral part of emotional intelligence. It enables you to prevent your emotions from taking charge of your behavior. Emotions can easily take over, largely because the amygdala, the reactive part of your brain, is faster than the neocortex, the part that controls logical thinking. Your brain can push you to react to something before you’ve even been able to consciously think it over! That’s how emotional breakdowns happen. So, avoid a breakdown by pausing to give your neocortex some time to process what’s going on. If you can’t identify and consciously think about your own emotions, they’ll take over. If you’re afraid of failing at something, for example, you might start procrastinating in attempt to avoid the project altogether. But you’ll only end up creating a self-fulfilling prophecy: you’ll definitely fail if you don’t try. Managing such a situation is a matter of managing your own fear. Effective self-management also requires self-control. Self-control is the ability to stay calm, even when your emotions are going wild. It’s certainly difficult at times, but there are some good techniques that will help you stay cool: First off, identify what triggers your biggest emotional reactions – those times when your emotions try to take over. You can’t manage your triggers if you don't know what they are. You can also reduce your stress by avoiding long workweeks. Take care of yourself, both mentally and physically! Finally, make sure you have a healthy network of support. Talk to your friends when you need help managing your emotions and ask them for feedback on your behavior. The next key part of emotional intelligence is building strong relationships with other people, and that requires social awareness. Social awareness is about understanding the emotions of others. It’s made up of four parts: empathy, organizational awareness, seeing others clearly and setting emotional boundaries. Empathy, the first component, refers to your ability to understand how other people feel. You’re able to recognize another person’s emotions – whether positive or negative – and engage accordingly. As a project manager, that means you need to listen to your team members using empathetic listening. Don’t just listen to their words alone; try to figure out what they’re really feeling. You also have to master the ability to see others clearly. That means understanding people and accurately assessing their strengths and weaknesses. It’s more challenging than it seems. Even if you don’t like the person, strive to think objectively; otherwise, you might impose your own bias. Take the time to really look and think. Organizational awareness is closely linked with seeing others clearly. Organizational awareness is the ability to understand the emotional context of your particular company, project team or other organization. What’s the power structure? Which emotions does it generate? The last step is setting emotional boundaries that protect you from the emotions of others. It’s important to relate to other people’s emotions, but you shouldn’t allow them to control you. Altering your language is a good way to help with this. So if you’re angry with someone, for example, say you feel angry, not that they made you angry. Taking responsibility for your feelings is always better than blaming them on someone else. Project managers have to build relationships more often and more quickly than most people do. That’s why relationship management is crucial! Relationship management has two key components: establishing stakeholder relationships and developing others. There are four steps to establishing strong stakeholder relationships: First, identify the project stakeholders, anyone who affects or is affected by the project: the team members, vendors, sponsors and so on. Next, gather as much information as you can about them. What role does each stakeholder play? What are their goals and interests? How do they communicate? After that, develop relationship strategies for them. Figure out what your most effective relationship with them would be and start working toward it. Finally, keep managing the relationship – it’s an ongoing process. Check regularly that things are going well and your relationships are producing the results you want. You might do this by establishing regular meetings to check up on how everyone feels. The second part of relationship management is developing your team members. That means acknowledging and commending their strengths, mentoring them and providing them with useful feedback. Developing others is ultimately a form of investing in the project team. So, first off, acknowledge their strengths: make them aware of their potential and always say “thank you” when they contribute to the project. Next, give them targeted feedback. Targeted feedback is clear, objective and aimed at helping the person improve, not at putting them down. So don’t emphasize someone’s laziness; instead, focus on where they could improve. It’s always better to talk about what could make someone’s performance better, as opposed to what made it bad.   Finally, never stop mentoring and coaching your team members. Offer advice and encouragement whenever you can. Make sure they feel that they can always talk to you and that you’ll listen to what they have to say. The final aspect of emotional intelligence for project managers is team leadership. Team leadership is the ability to lead the project team toward their goals in a healthy and effective way. It’s how you overcome conflicts and keep everyone on track. Communication and conflict management are the two most important skills here. Positive communication allows you to set the right emotional tone in all exchanges. It’s a big part of your job as a project manager, whether you’re communicating with stakeholders, team members, in an interview or over lunch. Project managers have to communicate in a way that creates the right emotional atmosphere and avoids any feelings of negativity. Imagine you’re about to hire new staff, for example, and you’re nervous about conducting the interviews. If you don’t come to terms with your fear, it could cause you to overlook the right candidate or hire one that isn’t right for the position. Instead of succumbing to fear, create a comfortable setting and approach your interviewees with empathy. Look for cues about what they’re feeling and share your own emotions when appropriate. Afterward, be sure to ask them how they felt about the exchange. Emotional intelligence will also help you manage any conflicts that arise. That’s where skills like compromising come in. Compromising means solving the problem by openly discussing it and getting both sides to give up some of their demands. You need to be self-aware and manage your own emotions in order to hold a truly open discussion; if you’re not, your emotions might take over. You also need to listen empathetically and communicate carefully with everyone involved. Compromising requires a lot of emotional intelligence! The key message in this book: Emotional intelligence is important for everyone. But it’s especially important for project managers, as their job rests on human communication and solid connections with others. So work on your self-awareness, manage yourself and your different relationships and listen empathetically to your team and stakeholders. Emotional intelligence doesn’t just make the workplace more pleasant; it gives you a competitive edge and helps you work toward your goals, too! Actionable advice: Have lunch! Take a lunch break with a stakeholder instead of eating a sandwich at the office. You’ll get to know them better and learn more about them in a relaxed setting. It’s a good way to strengthen your relationships with the people who matter most.

It’s not easy, is it? Trying to do very opposite things at the same time is a challenge not only for our bodies but also for our minds. In today’s competitive business world, leaders are often expected to do just that, perform tasks simultaneously that seem contradictory. On the one hand, a business leader needs to be a risk taker and passionate about her business, while on the other, she needs to be a calculating, rational manager. How can any one person master both personalities? These blinks will show you the way to best combine the energy of a daring entrepreneur with the cool judgment of a savvy leader so you can take your venture to the next level and beyond. In these blinks, you’ll discover how a simple to-do list can help you realize your dreams; why taking on debt is only for dummies; and why locking your staff out of the office isn’t an effective motivation technique. What sort of qualities do you expect from a start-up founder? A start-up founder certainly needs to be comfortable taking risks, and should have the go-getter attitude of an entrepreneur. What’s more, she needs to be comfortable thinking outside the box, as that's how she’ll create new products and find the right market niche. It's also necessary for a start-up founder to be a great leader. She should be disciplined, yet humble. She also needs to keep her cool under pressure, especially during the hectic early days. Ultimately, an effective start-up founder should embody just the right combination of qualities from great leaders and great entrepreneurs. In other words, you need to be an EntreLeader. An EntreLeader is a risk-taker who can spot gaps in a market. She is a passionate individual with a strong desire to succeed, but she’s also a capable leader who can motivate a team and can make tough decisions with integrity. A company’s leader determines a company's culture. Thus a leader needs to have strong EntreLeadership skills if she wants to succeed. Many CEOs today struggle with this. They don't always realize that strong leadership skills are just as important as strong entrepreneurial skills. The author too struggled with being an effective leader. In one of his earlier ventures, he managed 14 employees. Although he was passionate about his work, he was often frustrated that his staff didn't share his passion equally. He often overreacted to small issues, such as employees showing up late. Letting his anger overwhelm his reason, the author once forced his whole staff to sit outside on a chilly day, telling them that being late would “leave them out in the cold.” Unsurprisingly, this demonstration didn't go over well with his staff. And his failure to be a balanced leader didn’t only bring down the spirit of his employees, but it also hurt his business. The good news is that leaders can always learn and change. When you adopt the necessary skills to become an EntreLeader, you can bring your organization great success. When you imagine your dream business, of course you can’t help but dream big. You know that through your ingenuity, innovative thinking and hard work, you’ll achieve success. Unfortunately, many of our dreams never become reality. So what can you do to realize your dream? An EntreLeader breaks her dream into specific goals that each have a clear set of steps to achieving them. In doing so, an EntreLeader and her team always know what they’re working on and where they’re headed. To keep your team on track, try using a well-known management practice called management by objectives, or MBO. First, you agree to a set of goals with each member of your team. Next, you set a clear deadline for when those goals should be met. Accountability is important. If team members are involved in the goal-setting process, they’re also on the hook if things go awry; this fact helps to keep everyone motivated and on track. And setting goals isn’t a process just for your employees – you can and should adopt this process, too. Have you ever avoided a task because you were afraid that you'd fail? This kind of hesitation can prevent your dreams from becoming a reality. Avoid unnecessary delays by setting goals for yourself. When you set a well-defined goal with a clear deadline, it’s hard to wander off course. You know the path; so you have to keep going. The author’s friend, a web designer, decided to start his own business. He struggled in the beginning, so he set a goal of earning $5,000 per month after 120 days – or close the business. This self-imposed pressure energized him and forced him to take action. And as a result, he ended up earning $7,000 per month, much more than he had planned! Your dream is the starting point of your business's success, but be sure you’ve set a clear plan for realizing it. Have you ever spent a whole day working on a task, only to reflect and feel you hadn’t actually accomplished much? It’s not a rewarding feeling. You'll fall victim to this if you don't set a clear plan for what you want to achieve. A simple tool like a to-do list can keep you on track. A to-do list gives you control of what occupies your time during your busy day. Don’t fall into a situation where you only work when you’re asked to do so – work when things need to be done. Think of it this way: you probably would rush out to help a friend if asked, right? While it may be a kind gesture, this sort of behavior just creates more work for yourself, as in doing so you’re probably neglecting other important tasks. A prioritized to-do list helps you avoid reactive behavior. When you have an orderly list of tasks to complete, you'll concentrate better. You can still help out friends and colleagues, but you'll remember what you really need to do – and know when your list tasks are more important. A to-do list also gives you satisfaction when you look back at it at the end of the day, as it shows you all the goals that you’ve achieved and all the tasks now completed. When you review your list and see a bunch of “finished” check marks, you'll know you've spent your time wisely. You'll also know that the tasks you've checked off are the most important things you had to do – otherwise they wouldn't be on the list. A day spent on a well-planned family holiday feels much better than a day on the couch, right? That's because you've accomplished a list of meaningful tasks. Strive to make this a habit. What's the most important aspect of your business? You might assume it's your product. After all, you can't earn money without it! A product is important, but it's meaningless if you can't convince other people that it's important too. This is where a marketing department comes in handy. Behind every successful business, there's a great marketing strategy. A great marketing strategy connects your customers’ needs with your product. In 1994, the author started a class about how to avoid bankruptcy. He called it “Life After Debt,” marketed the class on the radio and offered a first session for free. Only six people attended the class, however. The author realized that his course wasn’t meeting his audience’s expectations, as most weren’t bankrupt but were interested instead in achieving financial stability. So the author revised his class, renaming it “Financial Peace University” and focusing on how students could achieve their financial goals. It was a huge success, and to date, millions of people have taken the class! This story also illustrates that building a strong marketing strategy is a learning process. While your first attempt probably won't be successful, you’ll learn from your failures and tweak your strategy accordingly. And in doing so, your strategy will just get stronger and stronger. And even if you have crafted the perfect strategy, you still need to make sure you’ve hired the right sales team. After all, they're the ones who persuade your customers to buy. Sales isn't about manipulating people into buying a product, but about giving people a positive experience by showing you care about their needs and offering useful information about how your product can meet those needs. You can't force someone into buying anything, but if you earn their trust, it's likely they’ll become a customer. So build trust by showing pride in your product and treating your customer with respect. And remember: a happy customer doesn't just buy a product, they tell their friends about it, too! Your company needs some capital to expand. But how do you find the money you need? A small loan wouldn't be risky as long as you're careful to pay it back, right? Wrong. Debt destabilizes your company, putting you at greater risk of failure or even bankruptcy. When you take on debt, you'll have to spend a period paying it off, which will reduce your cash flow. You'll have less money to pay your bills, your staff or buy stock. In fact, most small companies go under because of cash flow problems. Reducing your cash flow simply isn't a wise thing to do. Here’s a straightforward example of the perils of cash flow problems. The owner of a small but growing plumbing company obtained a commission from an important client to dig a ditch. To do the job, he needed a backhoe, but the rental costs were $450 per month. So the owner decided to take out a loan to cover the rent for the backhoe. After a few months, the owner realized that the fees associated with the loan were crippling his profits. The lingering debt essentially plunged a once-profitable business into crisis. Avoid the temptation of falling into debt by creating an emergency fund. An emergency fund is true to its name, in that it’s where you store extra cash to cover yourself or your business in times of crisis. The author benefited greatly from having an emergency fund. A bankrupt company was getting rid of its high-quality office furniture worth some $300,000. While the author didn’t really need furniture at the time, the fire sale price of $21,000 was too good to pass up. So he used his emergency fund to buy the furniture and stored it. Later on, he used the furniture for a new company, saving hundreds of thousands of dollars in the process, and importantly, avoiding going into debt. Financial stability helps you survive in the long run, as you’ll be more able to recognize problems and handle unexpected events. Every EntreLeader understands the importance of earning the respect of her employees. But what is the most effective way to earn respect? Here are a few pointers. First, make sure you always reward your staff appropriately for their hard work. A company's compensation system reflects a leader’s values. If you compensate your team fairly, they'll feel not only appreciated but also will work harder for you and the company. And if you offer your staff incentives, such as commissions or profit sharing, they'll be even more motivated to help your business grow. One company with a whopping $50 million in revenue employed some 120 workers. Yet despite the company’s successes, the CEO didn’t deem it necessary to pay even his top employees a salary of over $100,000. Unsurprisingly, these employees felt their work wasn’t being rewarded fairly, and started to leave for better offers. Eventually so many top employees left that the company had to shut its doors! If you treat your employees with dignity, they'll repay you with loyalty and motivation. So respect them and go out your way to please them – it's always worth it in the end. People just work harder for someone who treats them well! One of the author's employees, for example, sealed a million-dollar deal. The company's salary structure didn't stipulate that he should be rewarded, but the author rewarded him anyway. The author knew his employee would keep working hard if he showed how much he respected his work with a reward. The employee was so overjoyed that he wept! So when you hire the right people, you also need to build a culture of unity and loyalty. Your staff will perform better, and you'll enjoy much greater success. The key message in this book: If you want a successful company, be both an entrepreneur and a leader – an EntreLeader. Managing your team fairly and effectively is just as important as risk-taking and passionate deal-making! Define your company’s strategic plan, manage your time well, avoid debt and craft a thoughtful marketing strategy. Running a company is a challenging task, and only an EntreLeader is capable of success.

In this age of abundance, we feel like we need to have and do it all. However, this attitude runs headlong with an unfortunate fact: we can’t do it all. We can’t be an expert in every field, we can’t have every toy, nor can we have every possible experience. Not only that, but having and doing everything won’t necessarily make us more happy. In fact, we’ll find our closets cluttered with junk we never use and our schedules filled with tasks we can’t complete, at least not well. Instead, we should be focusing on what we should do, thinking instead about what is essential to our happiness and well-being. In these blinks you’ll learn all about how to identify the essential things in your life and what you can do to cut out everything else, thus giving you the mental and emotional fortitude to perform those most vital tasks to the highest standards possible. You’ll learn: why you should probably go ahead and throw away that stupid, howling-wolf shirt in your closet; what happens when airlines try to have it all and what sleep-deprived overachievers and drunks have in common. Our lives are so jam-packed with tasks and responsibilities that we struggle to identify which of them are the most important to us, that is, our priorities. Even if we make a concerted effort to go through all our tasks and pick out the ones we should prioritize, we still end up with too much on our hands. This overload of stuff massively hinders our productivity. Luckily, however, we can get our priorities straight by adopting essentialism. Essentialism focuses on four main points: Do less, but do it better. The cornerstone of essentialism is the never-ending task of identifying the less important things in your life to cut out, and doing what’s left over to a higher standard. Reject the notion that we should accomplish everything, and choose instead specific directions in which you can excel. Essentialism isn’t about making tiny progress in many directions. Instead, choose a direction and make great strides in the things that matter most to you. Constantly question yourself and update your plans accordingly. The process of deciding what’s worth doing and what should be let go is ongoing. The essentialist is always deciding whether what she is doing is actually worth her time or if she should invest her time and energy in a more productive area. Finally, once those few vital tasks have been distilled from the trivial many, the essentialist wastes no time in ensuring that the changes are put in place. While all that might seem easy, most of us are actually far from the mark. In the next few blinks you’ll discover how far away most of us are from the essentialist approach. Do you tend to say ‘’I have to” rather than “I choose to”? If so, then you are following the non-essential path. So many of us lose control of our ability to choose through learned helplessness, that is, becoming so used to the feeling of being overwhelmed that we approach our lives with passivity. To explain this a bit more, here’s an example: The term learned helplessness originates from experiments on dogs. In the experiments, the dogs were given electric shocks. Some of them were given a lever that would stop the shocks, others received a similar lever which had no effect and the last group received no shocks at all. Later, the dogs from all groups were put together in a huge box divided in two: one half administered shocks and the other emitted none. All the dogs from the earlier experiment who had the chance to stop the shock or had experienced no shock at all ran to the shock-free side. The ones whose levers were powerless, however, stayed in the shock zone and did not adapt. In other words, they had learned to be helpless. If we surrender our power to choose, we essentially give others permission to choose for us. When people think that their efforts are futile, they tend to respond in two ways: They either give up completely or become overly active, accepting every opportunity presented to them. At first, their activity might indicate that they have not developed learned helplessness. However, these people aren’t actually exercising their power to choose the opportunity which is best for them. They simply do everything. The ones who offer the possible choices, on the other hand, are the ones who hold the real power. If you had the power to travel back in time and build a fortune by investing in a company, which would you choose? IBM? Microsoft? Apple? While the success of those companies might make them an obvious pick for some, the biggest return on your investment would actually come from Southwest Airlines. In fact, Southwest Airlines displayed a remarkable level of success for a period by concentrating on one of the key tenets of essentialism: doing only a few vital things very well. Rather than offering their customers lots of choices, such as first class seating, meals and seat reservations, Southwest concentrated on one thing: flying people from point A to point B, and that’s it – no frills necessary. They realized that if they tried to do everything, they would undoubtedly fail. However, by concentrating on doing a few things very well, like getting travellers to their destinations, then they could be successful. Adopting this approach means being willing and able to make trade-offs, which can prove to be difficult. While it might seem simple enough to cut out unimportant tasks and leave only the most vital, in practice, we just end up becoming convinced that we can do it all. For example, when the success of Southwest became apparent, Continental Airlines decided to imitate their strategy. However, instead of cutting back to a few vital essentials, Continental erroneously decided that they could do it all. Their solution was to carry on with their traditional airline and create the separate brand, Continental Lite, to offer the budget service. However, the operational inefficiencies caused by pursuing both strategies meant that Continental Lite wasn’t price competitive. In the end, because they couldn’t sacrifice the nonessential and focus on what was vital, they lost millions. Now that you have a good idea of how far people often stray from the path of essentialism, the following blinks will show you what you can do to find the path again. Nowadays, hardly anyone has time to be bored. Modern technologies like our smartphones mean that we have access to a wealth of communication and entertainment. Since no one actually likes being bored, this sounds like a great thing. However, boredom can actually be good for you. A period of time in which you have nothing to do can give you an opportunity to think clearly about what needs to be done. In order to ensure that you have that time, clear a break in your schedule every day to give yourself time to escape: to think. Creating a space in your schedule just to think about your life – what options, problems or challenges you face – will help you assess which are vital and which aren’t. In fact, some of humanity’s greatest minds, such as Newton and Einstein, used this technique. Both of them confined themselves in solitude in order to escape, thus allowing themselves time to think about their groundbreaking theories. Many of today’s most successful CEOs do the same, scheduling a few hours of “blank space” in their calendar every day in order to do some thinking. However, escaping isn’t just a way to isolate vital tasks from the rest; you can also use it to ensure that you remain focused on the big picture. People often get so lost in the small, day-to-day tasks that they lose track of the reason they are doing those things in the first place. In order to maintain focus on what’s important, essentialism teaches us to always concentrate on the bigger picture. One way to do so is by keeping a journal, but instead of writing down everything you experience, force yourself to write as little as possible. This will require you to think through everything you’ve done and sift out only what you consider essential. And as you read back through your journal entries you will see the big picture emerge. Unfortunately, we adults tend to make a sharp distinction between work and play, having decided that play is something that is trivial and unproductive. It is there purely for entertainment, and doesn’t help us to advance our goals. In other words, it’s a waste of time. The essentialist, however, recognizes that play is a vital tool for inspiration. If you want to discover what’s vital in your life, you can use play to free your mind so that you can approach this subject creatively. Play can serve this purpose because: it helps us to develop novel connections between ideas that we would have never otherwise considered; it is an antidote to stress, which is one of the key factors in unproductivity and it helps us to prioritize and analyze tasks. We see the importance of play reflected in the culture of companies such as Twitter, Pixar and Google, who promote play by doing things like offering improv comedy classes or by decorating the office with a huge dinosaur or thousands of Star Wars figurines. Why do they do this? Because they know that a playful employee is an inspired and productive one. But as important as play is, it should never take priority over rest and sleep. Non-essentialists view sleep the same way they do play – as a luxury, a waste of potentially productive hours. This approach is totally backwards, as sleep increases your ability to think, connect ideas and maximize your productivity during your waking hours. One hour of sleep actually results in several more hours of higher productivity the following day! In fact, studies have shown that going 24 hours without sleep or getting a weekly average of just four to five hours of sleep per night causes a cognitive impairment equivalent to what you would have with a 0.1 percent blood alcohol level – enough to get your driver’s license suspended! Often, we fall into the trap of thinking that all of our tasks and responsibilities are vital in one way or another. Surely you’ve experienced something similar when you’re going through your closet during spring cleaning: you start with the mindset that “if I never wear it, it’s got to go,” yet, you soon find yourself making exceptions, and telling yourself things like: “I know I never wear this howling-wolf shirt, but I might want to one day!” So, you keep it and your closet remains as crammed as ever. So how can you avoid this trap? In short, be extreme with your criteria. One way to do so is by adopting the 90-percent rule. Start by considering the most important criterion for the decision you are making. For example, if you’re cleaning the closet, that criteria might be, “Will I ever wear this again?” Then, give it a score between zero and 100. With the 90-percent rule, anything that is less than 90 (even an 89) is a zero. After considering all the options, discard everything that scored less than 90. Another method is to decide that “if it isn’t a clear yes, then it’s a clear no.” A simple way to put this into action is to list the three minimum things that something must have in order to keep it, as well as three ideal criteria that you want it to meet. Then when deciding on what to keep, something must pass the three minimum requirements as well as at least two of the ideal ones. Thinking this way will hopefully allow you to avoid having trivial matters slip through. For example, there is absolutely no way that the howling-wolf shirt in your closet would pass the three minimum requirements: (1) “Is it stylish?” (2) “Would I wear it everyday?” (3) “Will no one laugh at me for wearing it?” So what do you do once you’ve made a list of everything that needs to go, that is, everything that is not essential to achieve your goals? It’s relatively easy to part with a shirt you never wear, but these decisions become more complicated when other people are involved. We tend to fear saying no, feeling both socially awkward as well as pressured not to disappoint the people around us, and are concerned that saying no might damage our relationships. However, often times we should say no, and reserve yes only for the things that really matter. To do so, you’ll need to separate the decision from the relationship. The pain of saying no may cause regret for ten minutes or so as you worry about someone else’s disappointment or that you’re missing out on something, but you might regret saying yes for way longer. Always remember, failing to say no to the things which aren’t vital can lead you to miss out on the opportunities that truly are. Once you’ve gotten used to saying no when it’s in your best interest, you can focus on planning the vital tasks that are left over. Be clear about your goals by having an essential intent: one main objective that is both inspirational and concrete. Imagine, for example, that your goal is to end world hunger. Although this goal is certainly inspirational, it’s not at all concrete, and thus fails as your essential intent. Trying to follow an objective of this magnitude will become cumbersome due to its vagueness. Now consider this goal: build 150 affordable, environmentally friendly, storm-resistant homes for families living in the lower ninth ward. Not only is this goal inspirational, but it’s also specific and concrete. In other words, your objective is abundantly clear. One way of checking whether your goal is clear is by asking yourself: How will I know when I’ve reached my goal? If you can reasonably answer this question, then you know you have clarity about what you are doing. Have you ever ended up doing something that you knew was a waste of effort simply because you committed to it? A lot of people fall into this sunk-cost bias. The sunk-cost bias is the tendency to continue investing money, time, effort and/or energy into something we already know is unlikely to succeed. Unfortunately, every little investment makes it harder for us to let go, while simultaneously increasing the amount we are sure to lose. To illustrate this, consider the spectacular failure of the Concorde jet. Although it was an astonishing engineering achievement, the cost made it unprofitable and doomed to commercial failure. Regardless, the French and British governments fell into a sunk-cost bias, and continued investing in it for four decades, fully aware that most of their money would never be recuperated. You can easily avoid this trap by developing the courage to admit your errors and mistakes and let them go. If it’s clear that something isn’t going to work out, then don’t be afraid to cut your losses and abandon ship. Moreover, you can avoid this entire scenario by setting clear boundaries. While a non-essentialist sees boundaries as unnecessary constraints, boundaries are in fact liberating on a fundamental level. Imagine, for example, a schoolyard on a busy street: at this school, children are only allowed to play in a small part of the yard next to the school buildings, and the teachers have to keep a watchful eye that the children stay within this boundary. But what if a fence was installed that clearly demarcated where the children can safely be? Then the teachers could use their time better, since they wouldn’t have to be so concerned with children being near traffic, and the children could play freely within that space. Boundaries are not there to constrain you, but to make your life easier and more enjoyable. For example, you could consider setting a clear boundary between work and family. If your kids aren’t allowed in the office, then work shouldn’t be allowed in your home. Once you’ve committed to the principles of essentialism, it’s time to grapple with the last step: execution. Becoming an essentialist requires you to identify what’s slowing you down and then eliminate it, rather than simply finding ways to work around it. For example, imagine that you’re a boy scout leader and need to get your troop to camp before nightfall. In order to keep things fair, each scout is carrying equal provisions in his backpack. But, you’ve got a problem: some of the scouts are much faster than others, and thus the group spreads out and the kids in the back risk getting left behind. Your first (non-essential) solution is to make stops every so often so that the stragglers can catch up. Next, you try taking the kids from the back and putting them at the front so everyone stays together, but this just slows everyone down. Finally, you see the essentialist solution: you take some of the weight out of the slower kids’ backpacks and put it in the fast kids’ backpacks. By thinking with the principles of essentialism, you’ve eliminated the problem! In addition, you can prevent unnecessary obstacles by being prepared. One of our biggest mistakes is assuming that our plans will go as expected. An essentialist, however, does not think this way. Instead, he assumes that things might go wrong and thus makes the right preparations. Whatever you do, whether it’s taking your kids to school or delivering a presentation at work, always give yourself a buffer of 50 percent of the time you expect it to take. This way you can always leave room to correct anything that ends up slowing you down. If you’ve ever achieved something in one fell swoop, then you experienced luck first hand. Most of the time, it won’t work out that way. In reality, creating success is all about building upon your previous progress with small, incremental steps. Small wins create momentum, which gives you the confidence to further succeed. Moreover, they allow you to stay on track by giving you the opportunity to check whether you are heading in the right direction. While it might be frustrating to take small steps, remember that the consequences of even small steps can be far-reaching. Take the police department in Richmond, Canada, for example. For years they tried to lower the rate of recidivism by using sweeping measures, such as more stringent laws and stronger punishments, with poor results. Then they decided to totally reshape their reforms by taking small steps towards crime prevention: When police saw young people doing something good, like putting their trash in bins instead of throwing it on the street, they gave them a small reward, such as free tickets to movies and youth events. These measures helped keep the young people off the streets, and after a decade of this policy, the rate of recidivism dropped from 60 to only eight percent. But no matter what your approach, you’ll need to ensure that you stick with it by designing a routine. Routines create a habit, thus making difficult things become easier over time. It’s therefore prudent to create a routine that aligns with your goals. For example, Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps’s coach got him to follow a routine during his training. Every time Phelps went to bed and as soon as he woke up in the morning, he had to visualize a slow-motion video of what he imagined to be the perfect race. Phelps then tried to replicate this video during training. Sure enough, he did this for so long that, when the Olympics came, his habits took over and swam the perfect race again and again, winning him a number of medals. The key message in this book: In spite of how it might seem, only a few things are actually vital to our goals and well-being, and everything else is unimportant. By focusing on these few essential things and learning to do better by doing less, we can craft a life that is far more productive and fulfilling. Actionable advice: Be an editor.  Rather than constantly adding more and more responsibilities and material possessions to your life, try instead to find ways to cut things out. The more trivial things you can eliminate from your thinking and routine, the better you’ll be at what’s left; the things that truly matter. Suggested further reading: The Power of Less by Leo Babauta The Power of Less introduces Leo Babauta’s ideal of productive minimalism. His approach focuses mainly on the development of good habits as the key to long-term changes. To find these blinks, press “I’m done” at the bottom of the screen.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

Everything. In today’s business environment, everything is connected. How successfully your company connects with not only your customers but also your employees and suppliers is the key to managing rapid market change and staying ahead of the competition. In these blinks, you’ll discover a holistic approach to managing the ever-increasing demands of today’s market by understanding how to strengthen these connection points and build a company comfortable with innovation and inspired by creativity. After reading these blinks, you’ll know why book retailer Borders went bankrupt; why a mindful CEO is better than a bossy one; and how a poorly designed office space will kill productivity. Much like a surfer rides a wave, a company must ride the waves of economic change or it will go under. In 1942, economist Joseph Schumpeter dubbed modern capitalism an innovation economy, with ”violent bursts and catastrophes” as well as revolutionary inventions. He described how products and companies are constantly swept away and replaced by new ones, calling it “creative destruction.” To prevent being swept away, a company must innovate. Schumpeter argued that in an innovation economy, the market isn’t directed just by efficiency but by innovations that can alter entire markets. The old model of success had companies offering the best product for the lowest price. Today, while one company works to create a cheaper product than the competition, another firm is instead developing an invention that makes that original product obsolete. For example, Nokia was an efficient producer of mobile phones, yet the company fell behind and lost customers once smartphones were introduced. A successful company not only needs to invent things to change the market, but also be able to constantly adapt to the changes in the market. Yet it’s not just technology that is changing; we do things differently now, too. In many industries, a company that cannot recognize and adapt to the latest developments is going to fail. Borders was once a major player in the retail book market. The company however failed to acknowledge the changes inspired by the internet, and chose not to enter the market for ebooks. Other book retailers were able to adapt and thus stayed alive, while Borders went bankrupt. Innovation is a constant process and is happening all around us. Not only with smartphones or the internet but also with data systems and airplanes. All this innovation has led to increased, intricate connections. Businesses are now interconnected within networks that transcend a single company, and are joined to an international web of suppliers and intermediaries. This web is evident, for example, in how a single can of Coke is produced. Aluminum sourcing and processing happens in Australia; coca leaf harvesting happens in South America; vanilla is extracted from Mexican orchids; and on and on. Connections are also appearing in ways that were previously impractical or impossible. The internet and social media, for example, allow customers to give direct feedback to companies. Product design is another area where the type and strength of connections are important. Programmer Mel Conway in the late 1960s said that, as a rule, companies will design systems that mirror their own organizational structure. While an abstract idea, we can apply this concept to many organizations and products. Let’s say an IT company has two software designers named John and Nancy. John and Nancy dislike each other so much that they rarely talk. If each have to develop one of two software modules, the chances of them interacting efficiently or clearly when it comes to producing the final product is poor; and thus the final product itself will probably be poor. What’s more, the greater the number of employees working on a certain product, the more complex that product can potentially become. For instance, if you’re compiling a medical diagnostic tool and a ton of specialists are contributing expertise, it’s possible your tool will become quite complex, reflecting the variety of expert input received. So we are all connected: leaders and employees and processes and products. But what can you do to make sure your business survives in such an interconnected world?   Let’s look at some techniques you can employ to ensure your company in an interconnected world continues to thrive. Do you know about mindfulness, a practice that helps you focus on the present moment? Did you know practicing mindfulness can help you become a better leader? Mindfulness heightens creativity and focus by allowing you to concentrate on the present without preconceptions or bias. This state of mind is conducive to creative work, as once you can see a subject or a situation in a new light or from an unbiased viewpoint, innovation follows. Studies have shown that mindfulness and meditation also improve the quality of your thinking. One University of California study found that practicing meditation boosted working memory and reduced the brain’s tendency to wander. In business, mindfulness helps you ascertain whether your actions are out of alignment with your company’s goals. For example, a manager may want to narrow his store’s product range, but he can’t attend a trade fair without succumbing to the temptation of buying new products. Being mindful teaches you to perceive a situation without immediately acting, helping you create some space between experience and reaction. Mindfulness also helps you perceive your own feelings more clearly, enabling you to understand the motivation behind your behavior. So in being more mindful, the manager could attend a trade fair without giving into the urge to buy new products. And thanks to his mindfulness practice, the manager may realize instead that he’s actually bored with his daily routine, and that he craves the novelty of new products. With this understanding, changing the situation isn’t difficult; he can plan to revamp his store by selling only the most interesting, novel items, for example. Can noisy ventilation shafts in an office affect the creativity and productivity of your employees? They certainly can! Before we see why, first let’s take a quick look at how humans evolved. Importantly, humans gradually developed multiple levels of consciousness, two of which we’ll examine here. First, there’s what researcher Stephen Porges calls the “lizard brain,” the part of our mind concerned with protection and survival. Our lizard brains scan our surroundings for indicators of danger, such as something burning or someone shouting angrily. Second, there’s the “mammal brain,” a phylogenetically newer part that is concerned with connections. This level of consciousness is involved with social behavior, enabling us to coexist in groups, raise children, play with others and exchange knowledge. It stands to reason that in the business world, you want your employees to use their mammal brain over their lizard brain! Employees who have an overzealous lizard brain aren’t particularly cooperative. They are also not particularly innovative, as innovation means change, which is scary for a lizard brain! In contrast, when employees use their mammal brain, they’re more likely to exchange ideas and come up with new connections, which as a result makes them more creative and cooperative. Interestingly, a company’s working environment can determine which “brain” is dominant and consequently, how cooperative and creative employees will be. So eliminate things in the workplace that could trigger employees’ lizard brains. Things such as noisy ventilation shafts or flickering lights create an uncomfortable environment that might make employees uneasy. Also, defensive or dismissive managers, unhealthy competition within groups or poor job security all create an environment where an employee feels unsafe, thus allowing his lizard brain to dominate. When we feel safe, however, our lizard brain stays in the background and our mammal brain is free to take control. Farmers grow crops; but do they actually make them grow? Not exactly. A farmer ensures the environment is just right for a plant to thrive, preparing fertile ground for a crop’s seeds. Much like farmers, managers can’t enforce creativity, but they can certainly cultivate it. Creativity doesn’t happen just because a manager orders her employees to be innovative. Given the right environment, staff will develop the necessary motivation and creativity on their own. If a manager interferes with or micromanages her employees’ creative processes, all she’ll end up doing is disrupting the process. Tedious brainstorming meetings help no one! Instead, an effective way of enhancing your company’s creativity is to nurture relationships. The better your employees are connected, the more innovative your company will be. Employees with good relationships within the company have more opportunities to communicate ideas, gather helpful feedback and gain support and supporters for projects. Activate Networks, a consultancy, discovered that good relationships with other people in a company are among the most powerful predictors of a team’s success. Remember, your employees are people and not just resources! It’s far more enriching if you see your company as a constellation of partnerships between different people. Similarly, your employees will be more loyal and view their work as more meaningful if they feel they’re treated as people with lives outside of work. One way this can be achieved is by encouraging staff to explore educational opportunities, even if the subject isn’t necessarily related to their job. Teresa Amabile at Harvard Business School reports that employees are more creative when they experience their work as meaningful, and when they have respect for the organization. Even if an organization acknowledges that its teams work well and that employees are responsible for certain tasks, often employees are still not expected to stray from set roles. The trouble is that this kind of set-up will flounder in an innovation economy, as its structure is too inflexible to adapt quickly to change. To break this cycle, make use of talent clusters, or teams especially put together for specific projects. Rather than comprising members from just one department, clusters gather employees from varied ranks and areas of expertise. Talent clusters also don’t limit the creative contributions of each member in the way that traditional teams might. In traditional teams, every person assumes a certain role; and as long as the team stays together, members may be stuck in a role of leader or innovator or expert, regardless of the project. Since talent clusters break up after a project is complete, members aren’t tied to one role. A person can be a leader in one project and an expert in another, according to their skills and expertise in relation to each project. In an advertising agency, for example, an employee with some medical experience would make a great expert in researching a PR strategy for a pharmaceutical company. But when it comes to creating an ad for a fashion company, that same person may better assume a managerial role, considering how to fund the project. Talent clusters are just a more effective and flexible way of connecting people and exchanging ideas. When employees are gathered according to department or in fixed teams, most of their contacts will be limited to these teams or departments. On the other hand, if an employee works with multiple people in a broad range of short-term clusters, she’ll build a network that breaks down departmental boundaries and enables fresh ideas to flow through the company. Imagine you’re hiring someone for a new position. You have a lot in common with one applicant and could picture them as a future friend. Another applicant is just as qualified as the first, but they’re wearing unusual clothes and are reserved – a personality type very different from your own. Whom should you hire? Though you might be tempted to hire someone similar to you, diversity provides a team with different perspectives and can promote creativity. The more diverse a team is, not only socially but also based on qualifications, talents, gender, life experiences, ethnicity and so on, the more varied a team’s perspectives will be on different work problems. Each different, unique point of view may well lead to alternative approaches or innovative solutions. A team with diverse members will generate more solutions as well for each new problem. Teams also tend to create products that meet their own needs and wants, hoping this will too satisfy customers’ tastes. But different groups have different preferences. Some groups want a car to be affordable and easy to drive, but others may see cars as a status symbol or a luxury item. So the more diverse your team is, the better its chances of developing a product that meets the desires of a wide array of people. Diversity also enhances creativity. Even the most creative people among us never start from a void; they build on what’s inside them, such as memories, long-considered concepts or older material. Creativity builds on creativity, too. Inventors often create new things by consciously combining old things in new ways. When Kirkpatrick MacMillan invented the bicycle in 1839, for instance, he didn’t need to invent the wheel first! If you expose yourself to a wide range of new experiences, you increase the chances of new combinations. So get out there: attend readings, conferences and parties and meet interesting people! Consider broadening your scope of experience, with art and media that addresses different themes and subjects. Discovering new concepts will better enable you to connect them and eventually to innovate! The key message in this book: To run a successful company, you need to be able to roll with ever-changing business conditions and demands, invent new products, lead the competition, please a wide variety of customers and ideally influence your field. Understanding the impact of interconnectedness is paramount in achieving success! Actionable advice: Don’t hire competitive star performers.  The next time you’re hiring, opt for candidates who have been lauded for their commitment and cooperativeness. These employees are more likely to stick around and support each other. According to a Stanford study, start-ups that choose committed employees are more likely to go public and less likely to fail, compared to businesses that prefer star performers.

His presence was simply spellbinding.  This kind of presence, however, isn’t just important for musicians or artists. If you want to be a successful leader, the right education and perfect resume just isn’t enough.  You have to have presence. And not just any presence, but executive presence. These blinks will show what this means and how you embody it to achieve your goals.  In these blinks, you’ll learn why you don’t have to hear a song to know an artist is a major talent;  how chief executive Bob Dudley’s gravitas saved BP from disaster; and why you need to get rid of your verbal ticks. How can you rise to a top position or gain a significant following if you can’t convince the world that you are the real deal? To put it bluntly: you can’t.  Whether you’re a banker, a salesperson or a musician, having executive presence is a precondition for success. It’s a mixture of qualities that demonstrate that you are in command, or at least deserve to be. Executive presence alone is the make-or-break factor.  The author regularly attends the final auditions of the Concert Artist Guild’s international competition. There a huge pool of applicants is narrowed to just 12 talented young musicians who then compete before a very distinguished jury.  Of course, these young finalists wouldn’t have made it to the final round if they weren’t outstanding in their musical craft. But in the finals, what separates one finalist from the next has little to do with music.  So what is that special trait that makes a person stand apart? Guild president Richard Weinert revealed that the key is in the way an artist walks across the stage; the way her clothes are cut; the spark in her eyes and the emotion written on her face.  A recent study also demonstrates the importance of executive presence in the music world. Fascinatingly enough, people who were shown silent videos of pianists performing in international competitions were better at picking out the actual winners than those who watched the videos and could hear the music, too. That’s a powerful example of executive presence at work. And it’s no different in the workplace. The author’s research team at the Center for Talent Innovation conducted a national survey to map out the traits that make up executive presence.  The results? Executive presence appears to be based on three pillars: the way you act (gravitas), the way you speak (communication) and finally, the way you look (appearance). Consider America’s series of social crises over the past decade: the dot-com bubble, 9/11, fraud scandals, the mortgage meltdown. It’s no surprise then that people praise the ability of a leader who is able to stay cool, calm and convincing amid a crisis.  Gravitas, according to well over half of the leaders surveyed by the author, is at the core of executive presence. It’s that je ne sais quoi quality that makes some people seem like born leaders. Gravitas signals to the world that you have what it takes and can handle serious responsibility.  The most important part of gravitas is your ability to exude integrity, courage and confidence in times of crisis. When asked to identify what constitutes executive presence, most senior executives felt it was projecting confidence and grace under fire. So where can you see gravitas in action? In May 2010, crude oil from a broken well spewed into the waters of the Gulf of Mexico. BP was held responsible for the spill; the then-managing director, Bob Dudley, was grilled by the press in countless interviews. Despite the pressure, Dudley didn’t avoid or refuse to answer a single question. In fact, Dudley assumed BP CEO Tony Hayward’s position when the crisis broke. Hayward had created a public relations mess following a series of thoughtless comments. Any chance the company may have had to restore public opinion was obliterated with Hayward’s infamous remark in response to the stress of the situation, “I’d like my life back.”  Respected for his cool, Dudley in contrast seemed to be a compassionate, considered and competent leader.  As a leader, you will certainly make mistakes from time to time and suffer from the mistakes of others. Consider each of these moments an opportunity to demonstrate gravitas. Stay calm and confident amid a crisis to prove what you’re really worth. Can you be compassionate and make ruthless decisions at the same time? Most of us would say no.  But is this true? Not necessarily. Good leaders can and should be both compassionate and capable of making tough calls.  Decisiveness is another crucial aspect of gravitas. There’s no question that we often look to leaders to make the difficult decisions. Sometimes it’s not about making the best decision but simply making one when others don’t dare.  Bold moves are a mark of gravitas, because it takes courage to choose one path and then “own” the repercussions of the direction. When Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer declared that all employees were required to work from company offices, some leaders, such as former GE CEO Jack Welsh, applauded her decision. Others, including Virgin Group’s Richard Branson, condemned the decision as a step backward.  Either way, Meyer made a bold choice and in doing so, showed that she had grit. This boosted her gravitas and her shareholders’ faith in her ability to rescue the struggling internet company.  While decisiveness and toughness reflect a leader’s courage and resolve, such qualities can be dangerous when empathy and compassion are absent. Many decisive but emotionally cold leaders can come across as egoistic, arrogant or insensitive.  This is why emotional intelligence was seen as an important part of gravitas by the majority of leaders the author surveyed. Having emotional intelligence signals that you possess not just self-awareness but situational awareness, too.  Mayer’s decisions showed her strength as a leader but also revealed her weaknesses. She was criticized not for being tough but for being out of touch with the struggles of working parents – as well as hypocritical. Mayer herself had created her own child-care solution by building a separate nursery near her office for her nanny and infant son. Making unpopular decisions and enforcing them is indeed part of showing you’ve got what it takes to be in charge. But it’s not the only crucial aspect at play – equally important is the way you communicate. How do people know you have gravitas? It’s all about the way you “talk the walk.”  A 2012 analysis of 120 financial spokespersons found passion, voice quality and presence were the characteristics that made a persuasive speaker, while content was rarely a deciding factor.  So it’s not all about what you say, it’s how you say it. Superior speaking skills are often what mark you as a genuine leader.  Executives interviewed by the author cited inarticulateness, poor grammar, overuse of filler words and an off-putting vocal pitch or accent as the verbal tics that undermine executive presence.  Those they interviewed mentioned people with “shrill” voices, in particular women, who raise the timbre of their voice when they are emotional or put on the defensive. This shrillness is a turnoff for coworkers and clients, and can lead to lost leadership opportunities.  So how can one modulate a shrill voice? It’s not a matter of learning to sound more “like a man,” but rather hitting the optimally pleasing voice frequency of 125 Hz, which is a low frequency, as discovered by scientists at Duke University.  We humans seem to be hardwired for such lower frequencies, and of course, we usually pay attention longer to voices we find soothing and not irritating.  It’s obviously hard for you to know how you sound, as a recent Wall Street Journal article pointed out, as the bones of your head distort the sound of your voice. So don’t hesitate to ask for feedback on your voice from a mentor or a speech coach.  Whether you’re in a TV studio, a concert hall or the team hang-out space, your executive presence enhances your ability to capture and mesmerize your audience. How hard can it be? According to Suzi Digby, a British choral conductor, you’ve got to be fast: you only have five seconds to “touch the audience” or get them to engage with your message. Use this moment to show yourself as completely human. Don’t overshare or indulge in confessions, but unveil just enough of your core to create a connection between your listeners and you.  You need to get an audience to like you and root for you, but at the same time look like you don’t need to be liked. Then you’re in a fantastic position.  Now that you’ve grabbed your audience, how do you hold them? Keeping it simple is key. Be brief, straightforward and tell stories, instead of using bullet points. Former US President Ronald Reagan, an actor by training, earned the title of “The Great Communicator” because of his colorful storytelling and natural inclination to entertain.  But to command a room like Reagan, you’ve got to read it. Pay attention to the mood and make sure you absorb the cultural cues around you. Then adjust your language, content and presentation style accordingly. These tweaks prove vital to your success as a communicator, which is central to your overall executive presence. The French company Sodexo’s Rohini Anand was once in an especially high-pressure meeting in which she had to convince the firm’s top leaders to let outside experts advise them on a sensitive workforce issue. How did she tackle it? Well, she entered the boardroom ready to present all the evidence she’d amassed. At the last second, she sensed that the room wasn’t interested in her research process. Anand changed tack and instead just gave a short summary of the benefits. It worked and she convinced her audience. According to respondents in the author’s survey, appearance isn’t quite as vital as gravitas and communication. Still, appearance does have a role to play in your executive presence, because your gravitas and communication skills are filtered through it. The truth is that nobody will bother to assess your communication skills or your ability to make decisions if your appearance shows you don’t know what’s going on. But if you look sharp, people will be far more receptive to what you have to say.  For instance, when the author met with D’Army Bailey, a Memphis-based lawyer and former judge who walked with Martin Luther King, Jr., she was impressed with his appearance. He was fit, well-dressed and seemed very young. When the author asked for his secret, Bailey admitted he’d had multiple plastic surgeries.  While surgery is a radical solution, Bailey explained that he’d long grasped the connection between looking good and looking capable. His appearance was instrumental in making him look confident, credible and trustworthy to his clients within seconds of them meeting him.  Fortunately, a sharp appearance isn’t something you have to be born with. It can be learned, and it starts with good grooming habits. Grooming isn’t just key to making good first impressions, but it also signals that you’re in control, both to your competitors – and yourself.   The golden rule is to minimize distractions from your performance. Your appearance should not distract from your professional competence, but rather emphasize it. On the other hand, poor grooming signals you don’t notice sloppiness or that you don’t care enough to do anything about it, which doesn’t reflect well on how you might manage a team! Of course, your appearance will not score you a promotion on its own, but people respond visibly to it. A tidy appearance is essentially a statement of respect for your clients, colleagues and for yourself. There’s plenty of research proving the point that intrinsically attractive people have it easier. They get hired for jobs more, earn more money and even tend to get better verdicts in court than their unattractive counterparts.  But just because you might not look like a movie star doesn’t mean you can’t have executive presence. Primarily, it’s about embodying fitness and wellness.  Leadership, after all, is demanding. Would you give a job to someone who looks like he’s about to have a heart attack at any given moment?  Both men and women tend to be seen as less effective in the workplace if they have larger waistlines and higher body-mass index readings, because they are perceived as lacking confidence and discipline.  GE executive Deb Elam once remarked that being physically fit gives people the confidence that you will take care of what you are asked to do. Why? Because your appearance indicates you’re also able to take care of yourself.  So, all the more incentive to get enough exercise to tone your muscles and allow you to climb the stairs to the executive suite without being out of breath.  Clothing is crucial too, so make sure your suits fit your actual size, not the size you’d like to be. The right clothes improve your look and also your confidence. But above all, make sure your choice of clothing is appropriate for the audience and occasion.  One pharmaceutical representative for Bristol-Myers Squibb sent home a member of her team who wore a sundress and open-toed shoes for a presentation at a Princeton, New Jersey, hospital. This summery, casual look was hardly appropriate for serious meetings with people grappling with life-and-death decisions.  Remember that your work attire is like your armor – it should make you feel invincible and never insecure. With your executive presence in place and the clothes to match it, you’ll be well on your way to a leading role. The key message in this book: Executive presence is a winning combination of confidence, poise and authenticity. It is just as important as your skills and qualifications, and it will make or break your attempts to land a promotion or secure a deal. That’s because your executive presence reflects whether you deserve the success for which you strive!  Actionable advice:  Feedback is your friend! If you want to refine your executive presence, always ask for feedback. Better yet, ask for specific feedback. If you make a blanket request such as “How am I doing?” you’ll get a blanket answer. Instead, focus on a recent encounter that required considerable executive presence, such as a meeting with a crucial client or powerful leader. Ask a superior to assess your body language, speech and delivery, command of the room and so on. This feedback will serve you well!

Malone, Yuri van Geest","summary":"Think a standard business model will make you billions? Think again. Huge, slow-moving organizations are no longer the dominant force in business. Today, new companies are agile and achieving growth rates believed impossible in previous generations. How do these companies do it? Exponential organizations achieve exponential growth, that is, growth that skyrockets in a short period of time. Five-percent-a-year growth rates are a thing of the past; we’re talking about exponential growth that starts at 5 percent and doubles every period! Today’s exponential organizations like Uber and AirBnB are defining the shape of tomorrow’s companies. If you don’t know how to turn your firm into an ExO, then these blinks will show you how! In the following blinks, you’ll learn how ExOs can teach a government a thing or two; why video rental company Blockbuster couldn’t defeat Netflix; and why the biggest risk for a company is to take no risks at all. Have you heard of companies like Uber or AirBnB? If you have, then you’ve also come face to face with an exponential organization. An exponential organization, or ExO, describes an organization that because of its ability to leverage new technologies can claim production, output or overall impact that is at least ten times larger than a regular organization in the same field. In short, an ExO can do more, produce more and dominate its market niche with less people or resources when compared to a non-ExO company. ExOs are experts in adaptation. These companies are part of a new business paradigm, in which competition doesn't necessarily mean heavy hitters based in China or India. In fact, competing firms  could come equally from a start-up based in your neighbor’s garage! How long a company has been around or how many employees it has just doesn’t guarantee success anymore. Kodak, for example, was a historic, large organization that went belly up almost overnight. This new, finicky nature of the business world has other benefits, too: a company can now experience unprecedented rates of growth and success with a minimum of resources. Exponential growth as a concept is often not completely understood. Take the Human Genome Project, the goal of which was to sequence the human genome. In the project’s first seven years, researchers were able to only sequence one percent of our genome; yet in the following seven years, researchers were able to complete the remaining 99 percent! This sort of rapid progress is what sets ExOs apart – companies like Uber, AirBnB and Google are just some examples of successful ExO firms. Ideally small and flexible, the ExO model doesn’t just apply to businesses, but works also for NGOs and governmental bodies. Even the scientific field has embraced ExO ideas. Publications such as Researchgate and Figshare are now open source, so their work can reach even more people. The ideas behind exponential organizations have reshaped much of what we know about business today. And it’s only the beginning... Traditional companies like Coca-Cola and GE are still at the top of their industries. Yet if they don't change, their reign will soon come to an end. Let's look at the reasons why. First, companies are no longer restricted by traditional limits on growth. Linear growth – the idea that a company will grow consistently by a certain percentage each year – is definitely over. With technology, this is especially true. Moore's Law states that the computing price-to-performance ratio doubles every 18 months to two years. This means that you as a consumer pay less and less for more and more powerful technology. Noted futurist Ray Kurzweil maintains that this idea holds true for any organization that is based in information technology. Therefore, traditional companies based on linear thinking and growth are in danger. The life span of an S&P 500 company, for example, has fallen from 67 years to 15 years. Moore's Law has huge implications for countries like China. While China's economy is still largely based on producing cheap plastic parts mechanically, this process may be disrupted by advances in 3D printing within a few years. In short, we're in dire need of new ways of thinking. For too long traditional organizations have stuck to linear ways of thinking and linear production processes. Consider the waterfall method used in software development. This method begins with developers detailing the requirements of a project, then moving to design, implementation, verification and maintenance. It's a straight line that could be easily disrupted by the smallest of problems. As we find new ways of sharing ideas and building projects, such linear thinking will die out. The developers of Iridium learned this the hard way. While their project, creating a satellite net for cell phones to access global communications, was worthy, the company’s planning was slow and organization convoluted, thus it failed. By working dynamically and avoiding physical infrastructure costs, ExOs can avoid such failures. So why would you modify your company to adopt the ideas and structure of an ExO? First, consider the fundamental advantages of ExO companies. Linear organizations are dependent on having assets and a large number of employees. ExOs have few employees and are thus more flexible, and they can make use of resources that they don't own. Online rental company AirBnB, for example, has a small team of employees, but they can access a very large number of apartments and houses. The most important asset for an ExO is information. Customer and market data have to be stored and analyzed. This doesn't necessarily require much manpower, but it does require experimentation and flexibility. Many ExOs manage data automatically with the help of technological innovations. While not all ExOs share the same characteristics, any organization hoping to become an ExO needs to have a massive transformative purpose, or MTP. An MTP charts an ExO's aspirations. It outlines an organization's higher purpose, showing what it stands for. Your MTP gives you a competitive edge. Granted, only Google is bold enough to aim for organizing all of the world's information! An MTP also makes consumers feel good about using a product. Red Bull, for example, is more than just an energy drink – when you drink it, you're part of the community that “grows wings.” If you aren't ready to develop an MTP, you can aim first to achieve a clear plan for corporate social responsibility. This means offering something more meaningful to both your customers and employees aside from a great product or a comfortable working environment. For many ExOs, being socially responsible is a required strategy. ExOs are a big part of society's changing landscape. These companies have emerged from several dynamic shifts in the way modern businesses function. Huge improvements in information storage and processing technologies have accelerated the speed at which companies can do business. Product cycles are shorter, and new forms of competition have arisen. And today, one search engine (Google) dominates its field, while one e-commerce site (Amazon) has revolutionized online retail. Demonetization is also on the rise. It's now possible for a business to function with virtually no marketing or sales costs. There's also been a trend toward renting items rather than owning them. That's why the small company AirBnB is overtaking huge hotel chain Hyatt without owning a single hotel! Another change is that it's now rather advantageous for a company to be small. Small teams are more flexible, can take more risks and can be more specialized. We no longer need experts with Ph.Ds; untrained talent can offer a fresh perspective without being hindered by traditional dogmas. In 2012, the Hewlett Foundation sponsored a competition to develop an automated scoring algorithm for student-written essays. Interestingly, all three winners had no prior experience with natural language processing. Their lack of experience helped them come up with more innovative ideas! Disruption and unpredictability are also the new norms. It's no longer practical to plan too far ahead, because it's simply impossible to accurately predict what’s going to happen. Instead of adhering to a plan, ExOs adhere to their massive transformative purpose (MTP) and don’t plan things more than a year ahead. Doing so keeps an ExO ready to adapt plans to unexpected changes. Trust, too, is more essential nowadays. You have to trust your employees to manage themselves if you want to maximize their creativity. Simple tasks can be automated; and micromanaging isn't efficient anymore – if it ever was! The last development is a fundamental one: the idea that today, everything is measurable and knowable. This is a cornerstone of ExO thinking. So what does an ExO actually look like? Each company is different, yet each shares some external characteristics. These five characteristics – staff on demand, community and crowd, algorithms, leveraged assets and engagement – when combined, make the acronym SCALE. Having the right staff on demand is crucial for an ExO. Often ExOs maintain a small, permanent workforce that's diverse, creative and flexible, while hiring contractors when needed. For example, AMP, Australia's largest insurance company, uses contractors for nearly half of its IT department. Maintaining a community and a crowd both lower the costs and risks of doing business. Your community is your core team, your users, your customers, company alumni, company vendors, partners and fans. The crowd is everyone outside your on-demand staff, or people you use for validation, crowdsourcing or even crowdfunding. Algorithms aren’t as scary as they sound. Search algorithms (a set of automated operations) made Google the world’s leading search engine; some human resource departments use algorithms to prevent biases in filling open positions. The L in SCALE stands for leveraged assets. It isn't necessary to own assets anymore – you just need access to them, and be flexible about it, too. While some companies still need to own some assets (like Amazon owns warehouses), if your company is information-based, the situation is different. TechShop, a Silicon Valley-based ExO, has leveraged its assets well. TechShop manages expensive machinery and offers companies access on a subscription basis. Even companies like GE and Ford use TechShop! Engagement is crucial for an ExO. Networks, games competitions and positive feedback loops are all ways of engaging people. Engagement helps inject your company with new ideas, paving the way for innovation. ExOs also share certain internal characteristics, which should support the company’s external ones. These characteristics can be broken down into IDEAS: interfaces, dashboards, experiments, autonomy and social technologies. Interfaces connect the SCALE externalities – such as your community – with the company’s internal workings. ExOs need interfaces to manage work and projects and send them into the world. Apple's App Store is an example of a fully developed interface, as it allows customers to see what apps are available, and what’s more, it's indispensable to Apple and all its products. Dashboards, on the other hand, allow people in an organization to access data in real time. Think of the dashboard in a multiplayer game like World of Warcraft – you always know where to go, how to get there and what to do once you’re there. ExOs also need to experiment. While traditional businesses sought to reduce risks, today, the biggest risk for an ExO is not taking any risks. If you want to succeed, you have to experiment. Mondelez International, a multinational confectionary company, employs “garages” to help employees experiment with innovative ideas. Disconnected from outside contact, participants can focus without distraction on the problem at hand, coming up with new solutions. The ideal ExO employee is comfortable with autonomy. ExOs need autonomous, multidisciplinary and decentralized teams if they want to satisfy growing customer expectations. Technology company High Fidelity, for instance, implements a rather extreme form of autonomy in its company charter. Every quarter, employees vote on whether they want to keep their CEO. And finally, social technologies keep communication channels open. More communication allows for greater transparency, and importantly, this keeps the organization connected to its massive transformative purpose (MTP). Anyone wanting to change an organization into an ExO must first change themselves. This starts with the C-level staff, as these individuals will experience the most pressure and be responsible for the results, good or bad. ExOs are still a new concept. Technologies and trends are moving the business world toward them, but managers and CEOs will feel these changes earlier and more profoundly. Their actions will determine if the organization is to survive. So you don’t have time to hesitate; you need to become an exponential executive. Exponential executives are particularly responsible for detecting meta-trends, or trends consisting of many other trends. Trends are crucial. Most contemporary technology wasn't around ten years ago, and new technology is already making today’s tech obsolete. 3D printing and autonomous vehicles, as just two examples, are meta-trends. The CEO of an exponential organization plays a vital role, as she needs to be constantly on alert for new competitive pressures or disruptive start-ups. Staying abreast of information is crucial; yet determining what data is important and what can be ignored is never easy. In Buenos Aires, for example, market researchers couldn’t figure out why people had dramatically stopped using car washes. It was eventually discovered that as weather forecasts had become more accurate in predicting rain, people knew better when they could forgo a wash. An interesting lesson: sometimes explanatory data is available, but you just don’t know where to look. In sum, if you are a CEO, you need to become a chief exponential officer. You need to reform your own understanding of your leadership position, as what was done before just doesn’t fly in an ExO. With the right team members and the right attitude, C-level start-ups as well as fully developed organizations can transform themselves into ExOs. Small, start-up organizations need to follow certain steps in becoming an ExO. If you’re at the head of a start-up, you should start by determining your massive transformative purpose (MTP). This is fundamental. Selecting a MTP is a personal journey, not business decision, as profit isn't an MTP. So ask yourself what it is that you're meant to do. An organization's MTP should define it and outline the path it will follow. Next, build a team and community. But remember that while a great team is essential, what you really need is a breakthrough idea. Don't work with an idea that's limiting or based on technology that's already been developed. Instead, strive for passion and creativity, as that's where great ideas will come from. The most critical step is establishing the right culture in your ExO. Culture is the glue; it's what holds things together when the boss leaves. Culture also ensures that you adhere to your MTP and any groundbreaking ideas are given their proper attention. Finally, you need to not only develop a good platform but your company essentially needs to become the platform for your ideas. Facebook, for example, is a great platform. Earlier competitor MySpace failed because its platform was weak, and it lost its community and customers to Facebook. Traditional organizations are like dinosaurs; they're going to go extinct if they don't adapt. While it’s possible to change an existing organization into an ExO, it requires a lot more work. Bigger, traditional companies often rely too much on their own internal processes for innovation. This is why video rental giant Blockbuster lost its market share to online upstart Netflix, for example. Blockbuster failed to anticipate the opportunities with online movie streaming. It focused on improving its shops, but didn’t offer streaming services. Blockbuster's company culture was fixated on store distribution, and crucially, it didn’t have a leader willing to take a risk. Don’t be a dinosaur! There are four main paths you can take toward becoming an ExO. The first is to transform your leadership by educating board members and hiring new, young and inspired C-level employees. Alternatively, you can partner with or acquire an ExO. If you take this route, timing is everything, because you need to buy an ExO just when it's emerging as a market leader. And if you do decide to merge, allow the ExO independence. You'll be the one learning from it! Google did this when it bought YouTube for $6 billion in 2005, at just the right time. You can also become an ExO by developing disruptive technologies yourself. Keep the tech independent from the mother company, then use it. Amazon's Kindle is a good example of this strategy. Even though Kindle essentially cut into Amazon's physical book revenues, it brought in even more revenue from e-books. Finally, if you’re not able to transform your company into an ExO, you can still adopt some ExO characteristics. Coca-Cola, for example, moved toward creating a massive transformative purpose (MTP) working with the inventor Dean Kamen. The company leveraged Kamen’s water purification device to take a stand for cleaner drinking water. The key message in this book: Exponential organizations are the future of business. If your company is to survive, you must adapt ExO thinking and practices. So whether you're founding a start-up or transforming an existing organization, outline a clear massive transformative purpose, get a flexible team and don't rely on linear planning. Expect the unexpected and always rely on your creativity! Actionable advice: Don't plan too far ahead. Remember that most successful ExOs don't outline plans more than a year out. The five-year or ten-year plans huge companies used to create will only weigh you down in today's business world. Instead, be prepared to face unexpected challenges and tackle them with a creative and open mind.

Whether you’re a team leader, manager or a parent raising kids, the answer is deceptively simple: praise. That’s about more than merely complimenting folks, however – if you really want to help those around you fulfill their potential, you need to start speaking to their most cherished values and skills.  And that’s where affirmation comes in. Affirmation is all about creating a supportive structure that encourages people to act on their best instincts. Doing that, organizational psychologist Tim Irwin argues, is a skill much like others – it can be learned.  How? Well, in these blinks we’ll be taking a look at affirmation in practice in a variety of settings. Drawing on the latest neuroscientific research, Irwin explains both the “why” and the “how” of affirmation as well as providing a wealth of actionable tips and tricks to help you become a more effective leader.  Along the way, you’ll find out:  why affirmation is much more effective than a simple compliment,  how to reinforce positive values and get the most out of your team, and  why yelling has long-term consequences for a child’s development.  Losing can be devastating. Take it from the author’s son, the captain of his school’s football team. The athletes he was leading had put a ton of effort into improving their performance but still ended up losing a vital match.  After the game, the opposing team’s coach came up to the author’s son and told him that it’d been an honor playing against him and his team. Despite the loss, he added, they’d played their hearts out and shown tremendous courage. It was just what the boy needed to hear, and it took the sting out of the defeat. After that pep talk, he even felt inspired.  No wonder: the human brain craves affirmation. That’s backed up by hard evidence. Neuroscientific research carried out over the last couple of decades has shown that the brain responds physically to positive emotional feedback.  How? Simply put, it releases neurochemicals which increase our sense of wellbeing. According to a 2005 study by the American psychologists Creswell, Welch and Taylor, affirmation reduces stress and sharpens our problem-solving skills. And that, in turn, boosts our overall performance.  That said, it’s important to remember that affirmation comes in different forms. Social life is full of low-key acts of affirmation. We often compliment someone on their clothes, for example, or tell a coworker that they’ve done a “great job.” These small pats on the back are nice enough, but they’re not the same thing as real affirmation.  The difference becomes apparent when you look at the etymological roots of the term itself. “Affirmation” comes from the Latin noun affirmatio, which is derived from the verb “to strengthen” or “fortify.” True affirmation, then, is deeper than a throwaway compliment. It’s about accompanying someone through a process and offering constant reinforcement through constructive feedback and – when it’s deserved – high praise.  A good example of how that might play out comes from the culinary world. In Japan, sushi apprentices spend years doing menial work before they’re allowed to complete even simple cooking tasks like preparing eggs. When they’ve finally mastered their craft, they receive the honorific title of shokunin or “artisan” from their master.  That’s the final act of support and affirmation bestowed by their teachers, the sushi masters who’ve spent years closely guiding their apprentices through the tricky process of mastering sushi-making.  If you want to compliment someone, it’s helpful to know a little about them – after all, everyone loves being praised for things that matter to them. If you’re crazy about fashion, for example, you’ll be pleased if a colleague tells you they love your new shirt. If you don’t much care about the latest sartorial trends, however, the compliment will fall flat.  The same goes for affirmation. The best way to communicate your support for a team member is to focus on what they really care about – their strengths. Let’s see how that works.  Typically, you’ll find four different personality types in the workplace: the doer, the advocate, the idealist and the challenger. As their name suggests, doers are all about getting things done. That sometimes goes hand-in-hand with a bullish insensitivity to colleagues. If you want to affirm a doer, your best bet is to praise them for doing a great job on a presentation or meeting a tough deadline.  Advocates are people-centered and seek inclusiveness. To support them, you should focus on their role holding the team together and keeping its members’ morale up. Then there are idealists – dreamers who think big and care about integrity. Affirming their work is all about thanking them for reminding everyone of the company’s original values.  Finally, there are challengers, folks who question the status quo and are always on the lookout for new solutions and approaches. If you want to praise them, you should emphasize how valuable you find their novel way of looking at projects.  But affirmation isn’t only about personal strengths – in fact, professional competencies are just as important. So let’s say you’ve called in a team member to congratulate them on hitting your firm’s financial targets. You’ll want to tell them that you appreciate their achievement, of course, but you shouldn’t stop there.  The key here is also to remind them why they did such a great job. To stick with our hypothetical example, that might mean praising the excellent judgment of character that allowed them to put together such a talented and hardworking sales team.  Emphasizing these qualities has two outcomes. First off, it shows that you’re interested in and aware of people’s hard work and achievements rather than just obsessing about company goals. Secondly, that kind of deep affirmation leaves folks feeling truly supported and even more determined going forward.  There’s been a great deal of philosophical debate over the millennia about what defines a person’s core. Some have claimed it’s the mind; others have argued that it’s the heart while others still have suggested it’s the soul. The jury is still out on that question, but here’s something we do know: wherever the core is, it’s where our deepest values reside.  That’s something effective communicators know. When they seek to affirm others, they speak to their most cherished values. But before we take a look at how they do that, let’s pause for a second and ask how such values are formed in the first place.  Essentially, there are two processes at work here: self-reflection and the influence of other people. The latter is especially important as it’s only in social contexts that we find our values being affirmed or contradicted by others.  You can see how that works by taking a fictional workplace incident. Say you’ve resolved a conflict between colleagues in a positive and respectful way. Your boss tells you that you showed a great deal of integrity in handling the issue and that this reflects well on your character. Chances are, you’re going to act in the same way again, right? Well, that’s because your values have been positively reinforced.  But affirming profoundly held values requires thoughtfulness and an ability to pick the right words. In fact, there are a couple of key concepts which are essential to communicating your affirmation of others.  Take courage. Imagine the following scenario. One of your employees is negotiating with the CEO of another company. The latter is keen to push the deal through as quickly as possible, but they’ve made misleading or outright false statements in the paperwork.  Standing up to the CEO takes a huge amount of courage for the employee, and that’s something you should affirm. Simply telling them that they’ve done a great job at the end of the process won’t have the same effect as recognizing their strength of character in dealing with this tricky situation.  Another keyword is humility. If you see someone sharing praise for a successful project with their colleagues rather than hogging the limelight themselves, make sure to affirm that behavior. When the author’s wife Anne was a kid, she took an art class at a local preschool playgroup. There she was told to follow certain rules – houses, for example, should be square, the sun a circle and treetops wavy. But that’s not how Anne wanted to paint. Instead, she splattered colors across her canvas at random.  Anne’s teacher Ms. Caldwell wasn’t pleased and told the whole class to gather around and look at the “mess” this precious would-be Jackson Pollock had made. It was a humiliation Anne remembers to this day.  That’s hardly surprising. Criticism like Ms. Caldwell’s isn’t just painful at the time – it also has a long-lasting effect on the brain. Take a 2011 study by American neuroscientists Etkin and Egner. Criticism, they showed, activates the amygdala, the part of the brain responsible for the flight-or-fight response to life-threatening situations like confronting a lion in the wild.  A 2012 study by Chinese management researchers Liu and Liao also found that criticism impairs proper cognitive functioning. Criticism, they argue, undermines our ability to think abstractly and creatively and engage in self-reflection. That weakens our resourcefulness and self-confidence.  As Anne’s example shows, criticism is especially damaging when it’s public. In 2013, neuroscientists Stallen, Smidts and Sanfey demonstrated that social conformity is linked to parts of the brain responsible for processing emotions. Following our peers’ lead and winning their acceptance triggers the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter that gives us a sense of wellbeing.  And that’s why criticism in front of a peer group is so devastating. Not only does it trigger a flight-or-fight response but it’s also associated with the negative feeling of being rejected by our tribe. That, in turn, further undermines our self-belief. The takeaway here? Keep criticism private and make affirmation and praise public! In the following blinks, we’ll look at how to do that in several real-life situations.  Positive leadership and affirmation are crucial in times of crisis. That’s something Eric Pillmore knows all about. In 2002, he was appointed vice president of corporate governance at Tyco International, a security-system manufacturer.  Pillmore had his work cut out for him. The former CEO had siphoned hundreds of millions of dollars out of the company’s accounts, and Tyco looked like it might go bust at any moment. Pillmore’s job: turning things around.  How? Well, here’s where he started: rebuilding trust in individuals. When organizations find themselves in dire straits, individuals usually start scrambling to save their skins. In Tyco’s case, employees were worried that the company’s association with criminal activity would affect their reputations.  Pillmore realized that he had to make Tyco trustworthy again. Together with other senior leaders, he organized a series of meetings in which the firm’s 230,000 employees could voice their concerns and ask managers what was going on. It was a canny move. Workers felt that their superiors were taking them seriously and began to trust the company again.  The meetings continued until everyone’s issues had been addressed. By the end of the process, formerly enraged employees were giving their leaders standing ovations!  Pillmore also realized that while restoring individual trust was a good starting point, it wasn’t enough: he also needed to establish group trust. The crisis had been so severe that workers hadn’t just lost faith in their managers – they’d also started distrusting one another.  Over the following years, more meetings were held. These focused not so much on individual concerns but on establishing transparency and accountability within teams and groups. It was a stunning success. In 2007, Governance Metrics – the company which rates Tyco’s corporate accountability – gave the firm ten points, a perfect score. Not bad when you consider that its rating in 2002 had been just one and a half! Ask the average employee what they think of their annual performance review and the two words you’ll hear most often are “uncomfortable” and “stressful.” Why? Well, two issues stand out. First off, reviews often lead to misunderstandings between workers and their bosses. More importantly, employees end up feeling like their contributions over the last year haven’t been fairly assessed.  Luckily, change is afoot in the corporate world. Take the old-school approach of rating employee performance on a scale from one to nine using abstract and complex metrics. Today, top companies like Microsoft, Dell, Goldman Sachs and New York Life have abandoned the attempt to put a number on their workers’ efforts.  There’s a good reason for that. As FedEx CEO Michael Ducker notes, workplace performance just isn’t measurable in the same way it used to be, especially in the growing service industry. What matters today is discretionary effort – the way employees interact with clients, say, or the time and resources they invest in personal development. None of that can be quantified numerically.  So what’s the alternative? That’s where affirmation-based performance review systems come into the picture. These do away with pseudo-scientific quantification and instead rely on subjectively determined and broad categories like “excellent,” “very good,” “average” and “needs improvement” to define performance. That creates a lot more room for affirmation as it allows bosses to use reviews to highlight key competencies like technical skills or people skills that helped an employee achieve company objectives.  More importantly, it shifts the focus from targets to the question of how work has been carried out. In this new system, an employee who achieves their sales goals but creates a toxic work environment won’t automatically be rewarded with a higher rating than a colleague who falls short of the target but uses his time to help others and encourage the team to grow together.  These kinds of review systems also mean that there’s much greater emphasis on individuals. As we saw in an earlier blink, affirmation encourages positive behavior. Building that into performance reviews makes it much more likely that employees will have key character traits like courage and self-regulation reinforced. Abusive coaching, parenting and teaching are all too common. In some areas of life, like athletics, yelling and harsh criticism are even celebrated as the best way of getting kids to fulfill their potential. But here’s the truth: shouting at children just isn’t very helpful if you want them to go far in life.  So why do people do it? As the social psychologist Barbara Fredrickson points out, folks tend to assume it works because of its short-term effects: when you yell at kids, you get their attention, and they do as you say.  In the long run, however, that strategy inevitably ends up backfiring. That’s because criticism and yelling have a negative impact on children’s loyalty, their ability to bond with authority figures and other members of their group as well as on their performance levels and personal development.  So here’s the alternative: affirmative feedback.  That’s essentially all about relating a child’s behavior to a goal to which they aspire and pointing out the differences between the two. If a child wants to become a doctor, astronaut or engineer, for example, they’ll need to develop specific skills and attitudes to achieve that goal. Pointing out that their current behavior is leading them away from their goal is a much more effective strategy than hollering at them. The same goes for a kid who’s set on applying for a prestigious college but has started coming home with poor grades. Rather than getting mad and working yourself up about your child’s academic results, you could just as easily remind them that they’re undermining their dreams.  Affirmation also works wonders in the classroom. Teachers who avoid shaming and humiliating kids and instead tell them that they believe in their ability and encourage them to put their mind to the task at hand are much more likely to help their pupils achieve their potential.  And that just goes to show how important affirmation is! Whether you’re a parent trying to help your children navigate life or a manager encouraging your employees, speaking to people’s best selves is one of the most powerful tools in your communication toolbox. The key message in these blinks: The scientific consensus is clear: affirmation has a positive effect on the brain. But here’s the flipside: unconstructive criticism, yelling and humiliation are just as capable of altering the brain – for the worse. In fact, nothing is quite as likely to undermine a person’s resourcefulness and self-confidence. The alternative? Affirmation. That’s all about speaking to people’s core competencies, values and strengths. And once you learn the art of affirmative communication, you can begin encouraging your children, colleagues and employees to become their best selves.  Actionable advice: Improve your self-awareness by journaling.  If you want to affirm others, you’ll need to develop a high level of self-awareness – the ability to recognize and manage your emotions, thoughts and ideas. Why? Well, if you’re grumpy or grouchy, there’s a good chance you’ll lash out at those around you rather than offering them supportive affirmation. That’s why it’s a good idea to start keeping a journal. Recording your feelings and interactions throughout the day sheds light on your inner emotional life and gives you invaluable insights into what you can do to improve.  Got feedback?

This holds especially true if your mission is to secure the city of Ramadi, which, during the Iraq War, was one of the most violent battlefields in the country. These blinks are based on the impactful insights of two Navy SEAL task unit leaders, who served in Ramadi and whose ability to take charge in battle often determined whether their men lived or died. You may be wondering how this is relevant to you if you’re not in the military. Luckily, the principles that underlie the success of Navy SEAL units can be applied to any team or organization that wishes to succeed in complicated tasks and difficult missions. With strategies such as “cover and move” and “prioritize and execute,” you’ll learn how to lead and win even the most challenging battles. You’ll also discover how accepting blame can save your job; why teams within a corporation should collaborate rather than compete; and why facing explosives and machine guns isn’t necessarily reason enough to abort a mission. In 2012, one of the authors, Jocko Willink, was in Ramadi, Iraq, as a SEAL task unit commander when his unit was met with heavy fire from what was assumed to be the mujahedeen, or enemy insurgents. But as it turned out, it wasn’t the mujahadeen at all; it was another SEAL unit and, in the chaos of the friendly fire, a soldier lost his life. As the ranking officer in the operation, there was only one thing Willink was certain of: everything that went wrong was his responsibility. And guess what? By taking ownership of this horrible event, he actually saved his job. That’s because his superiors knew what lots of business leaders don’t: every leader makes mistakes, but only the good ones take responsibility for them. That’s why he was allowed to keep command of his unit. The importance of the commander’s attitude can also be seen during the worst-case-scenario trainings that SEAL teams undergo. The majority of units that underperform during such operations have leaders who blame either the scenario, their subordinates or the troops themselves. In other words, by refusing to take responsibility, they fail their missions. On the other hand, the SEAL units that perform the best in training are led by commanders who readily shoulder blame, seek out constructive criticism and take detailed notes on how to improve. When leaders fail to take responsibility, the consequences can be far-reaching. For instance, in Willink’s experience, when a poor SEAL leader blames everyone but himself, that bad attitude is passed on to his subordinates who then do the same. This results in the team becoming ineffectual and incapable of carrying out their plans. Such a team just makes excuses and passes the buck, instead of adjusting to and solving the problems that inevitably arise. By the same token, the subordinates of leaders who take total responsibility emulate that behavior themselves. As a result, accountability and initiative spread all the way down the chain of command. When Willink’s military commanders told him that his elite, impeccably trained SEAL team would be fighting side-by-side with the newly minted Iraqi army, his first reaction was “hell no.” He felt the Iraqis were poorly trained, horrendously equipped and occasionally disloyal to their American allies. Nevertheless, he kept quiet and didn’t share his negative feelings with his troops. How come? Well, before speaking out against the plan, he had to figure out why it was being implemented. As it turned out, including the Iraqi army in Navy SEAL operations was actually a strategic move intended to eventually enable the withdrawal of US forces from the country. Once he learned this, he could believe in the mission and convince his team to do the same. So he went to work passing his conviction onto his unit. Once they too understood why the mission had been assigned, they were also able to commit to it and help carry it out. However, if Willink had questioned the mission outright, openly voicing his criticisms to his unit, the backlash from his team would have increased dramatically. Even if he had later seen the light of day and tried to convince them to support the mission, their doubts probably would have remained, and the mission may have failed. In other words, whether you’re the head of an elite military fighting unit or a corporate team, you as a leader need to be a true believer – that is, you must fully support the objectives of your team. So when you receive an order that seems questionable, you should consider how its objectives might align with the greater strategic goals of the organization you work for. After all, as a leader, you’re a part of something that’s bigger than both you and your team. If you can’t understand why you’re being asked to do something, it’s on you to seek answers from someone higher up the chain of command. Asking your superiors why a decision was made can be daunting, but a failure to secure this strategic understanding means eschewing your responsibility, a move any good leader must avoid at all costs. While carrying out a mission in the dangerous city of Ramadi, Iraq, the SEAL unit of one of the authors, Leif Babin, found itself deep in enemy territory with no backup. To get out, they had no option but to risk walking through the city in broad daylight. The chances of an enemy attack were sky-high, but the team made it back to base unscathed. That being said, after the mission, Babin discovered that he had made an error; there was another SEAL team close by that could have offered cover for his unit. However, he had been so focused on the problems of his own team that he had never thought to ask for help. Because of this, he failed to employ one of the most fundamental Navy SEAL tactics: “cover and move,” which basically means work as a team. The idea is that every element must work together and support all the others to achieve the overall mission. In the example above, Babin had been so myopically focused on his own unit’s objectives of “evacuation without injury” that he had forgotten what the other SEAL units were doing and how they could work together. As a result, he had put his team in greater danger than was necessary. So whether it’s in a combat setting or a business context, leaders have to keep one eye on the mission at hand and one on the broader organization, including other teams that might offer strategic support. For instance, in Babin’s work as a business consultant, he once noticed that different teams within the same corporation were blaming each other and competing against one another. They were in obvious violation of the principle of “cover and move,” which clearly states that internal teams should support one another and remember that the enemy is external, not internal. In other words, the competition isn’t the guy in HR, but the other firms who are trying to steal your customers. It’s midnight in Ramadi. The SEAL team has just left a building by moving onto what they thought was the roof of the building next door. However, this seeming roof turned out to be a mere tarp, and one SEAL has fallen through the covering and landed 20 feet below, injured and exposed. The unit itself is extremely vulnerable, deep in enemy territory without backup, with a wounded comrade and an enemy bomb at the building’s exit. What should the leader do? Naturally, in this situation, a number of problems are competing for attention. That’s why it’s the leader’s job to stay calm and decide on the best possible course of action. To do so, Babin thought back to his SEAL training and drew on a particularly useful principle: “prioritize and execute.” To remember this principle, SEALs verbalize it in the mantra, “relax, look around, make a call.” Even highly competent leaders will grow overwhelmed if they try to tackle every issue simultaneously, which is why it’s essential to decide on the top priority and focus on it. Once that’s done, the leader can move to the next priority and put his team’s focus there. In the example above, Babin’s first priority was security; his second was reaching the wounded soldier; and his third priority was getting a head count of all his men. By taking a mental step backward to assess the scenario calmly, he managed to do his job, despite the extreme pressure. Business leaders can use a similar approach. As a businessperson, you probably won’t find yourself in life-and-death situations, but you can still benefit from prioritizing and executing. Here’s how: In any given situation, begin by evaluating your highest priority. Once you’ve done this, simply and concisely communicate this priority to your team. Then seek input from key leaders around you on how to solve the problem at hand and, finally, focus your team’s resources on executing this plan. After that, you can move to your next priority and repeat the process. But remember that, as priorities shift, you need to be sure to communicate the change to your team too. Just minutes before the launch of a SEAL operation to rescue an Iraqi hostage who was being held by Al-Qaeda, Babin’s intelligence officer told him that the hostage was not only surrounded by explosives but also guarded by bunkered machine guns. In an instant, the operation’s risk level skyrocketed. Nonetheless, Babin moved forward as planned, because he had already accounted for this extra danger, even before he knew it existed. As a SEAL unit commander, he’d already assumed the existence of such hazards. To do anything else would have been to ignore his total leadership responsibility in the situation. Factoring such potential risks into the comprehensive plans he had prepared and outlined for his troops was simply due diligence. Indeed, he had put in place a series of steps to mitigate the risk of potential explosives and machine guns surrounding the target. Because of this thorough planning, there was no need to make a new plan or postpone the operation, despite this substantial new intelligence. Such preparedness is so vital that Babin often uses this situation as a training scenario for SEAL recruits. He asks them a difficult question: “Would you still have executed this mission after discovering these risks?” And the correct answer is always yes. The lesson here is that leaders, regardless of context, should always take the time to generate a detailed plan that identifies, quantifies and mitigates all known potential risks. Making such comprehensive contingency plans helps reduce risks in the future because every person in the operation knows exactly what to do if things go off the rails. This makes success more likely since your team is prepared for the unknown. But remember, there will always be some risks that can’t be mitigated, which is why good leaders concentrate on the risks that can be controlled. When Babin and Willink were in Iraq as SEAL unit commanders, Babin would frequently burst into Willink’s office, demanding to know why their commanding officer was bombarding him with emails asking what Babin felt were stupid questions. Why was he being pestered in this way? Didn’t the commanding officer know how many important things he had on his plate? To this question, Willink simply replied, “No, because you’re not taking responsibility for telling him.” This helped Babin eventually realize that the higher-ups weren’t psychic; they were only asking about his operations because he hadn’t given them sufficiently detailed updates. In other words, the commanding officer was just trying to get the information he needed to approve Babin’s plans himself, pass them up the chain of command for final approval and enable Babin to execute his combat missions. This realization taught him an important lesson: he had to check his own negative attitude and do his best to provide highly detailed operation-planning documents to his superiors. However, many business leaders don’t understand that this is necessary to maintain good relationships with their supervisors. Lots of leaders think that, if their own boss isn’t giving them the support they and their team need, it’s the boss’s fault. But what they really need to do is take a look in the mirror and remember that it’s their own responsibility to provide the critical information their bosses need to give them support and make decisions. To put it differently, a good leader always pushes awareness of a situation both up and down the chain of command. Taking total responsibility as a leader means leading and influencing every person around you, whether they’re a subordinate or a superior. The key message in this book: As a leader, whether in a military or business context, you need to take total ownership of your team and its work. Doing so means bearing responsibility for your team’s successes as well as its failures, drafting detailed plans that account for risks and maintaining tight lines of communication in all directions.  Actionable advice: Decentralize command for effective management. As a general rule, people can’t effectively manage more than six to ten people directly. Nonetheless, many business leaders manage much bigger teams. Here, the Navy SEAL management principles can help: First, break your team down into sub-teams containing no more than four to five people, each with a designated leader. Make sure that these leaders understand the larger team’s overall mission as well as its ultimate goal. Then empower your junior leaders to make decisions that help attain that goal on their own.

You have to juggle many issues, such as budget, time frame, supplier contracts and team concerns. Luckily for you, you can refer to earlier projects to get an idea of best practices or trouble spots.  Or can you? If you’re working on a truly innovative project, this might be difficult – you and your team may be going where no one else has gone before. Other projects might be interesting but not helpful; where, then, can you turn for guidance to keep budgets trim and deadlines met? These blinks are your guide to managing innovative projects on deadline and under budget. They’ll show you how to carry your project to success, by following just a few rational and logical guidelines.  In these blinks, you’ll discover when “stormdraining” can be more useful than brainstorming;  how borrowing technology keeps NASA projects on time and under budget; and  why a US fighter jet project missed engaging the Soviet “threat” by a good decade.  When you head a creative project, plenty of challenges will come your way. Luckily, there’s a fail-safe method that innovative project managers can use to stay on track, and it’s called F.I.R.E. F.I.R.E. stands for Fast, Inexpensive, Restrained and Elegant. Everyone can use the F.I.R.E. method to improve their processes and achieve their goals. Make your project fast by dividing it into smaller tasks that can be completed quickly. Big projects often drag, and sometimes it’s hard to feel you’re making progress. When you design for yourself a smaller group of shorter tasks, you can focus on each task one at a time, and set clear, achievable deadlines.  This means you have to stick firmly to a schedule, however. And being fast isn’t just about working quickly – you have to focus as well on quality. If you work quickly but sloppily, you’ll only create more work for yourself further down the line. In the end, you won’t really have saved much time. Keep your project inexpensive by maintaining a small budget, and aim to solve problems with your smarts before throwing money at them. Inexpensive doesn’t mean cheap, however – it’s about efficiency. Learn to make the most out of what you have.  Being restrained is about staying in control. When you’re restrained, you don’t allow unexpected circumstances to determine the direction in which your project heads. Instead, you control the situation by holding regular meetings, maintaining short schedules, organizing small teams and keeping a tight budget.  Finally, being elegant is about focusing on simplicity. Remember: less is more. Simple projects, if done correctly, are better than complicated ones, as they’re easier to work on and ensure high-quality results.  Often when you have a question, you “ask” Google. And in turn, the Google search engine provides you with a host of answers, whether you’re looking to lose weight, fix a stove or consider space flight.  How does Google do this? The company’s engine simply searches through the tons of research stored online, considering the millions of questions that have already been answered. Innovation works the same way; you just need to know what to search for.  To find a solution to a specific problem, however, the first thing you need to do is generalize it. Here’s another handy method to help you do this.  TRIZ is an acronym that describes a Russian method of inventive problem-solving. This method explains how any technical problem can be solved in four steps.  First, you identify your specific problem. Second, you generalize it. Third, you find a general solution to the general problem. Fourth, you use the general solution to develop a specific solution to your specific problem. That’s TRIZ! Let’s say you’re trying to design a larger engine for a more powerful airplane. You want the plane to fly further and higher, but it can’t lift off properly because it’s now heavier. That’s your specific problem.  Next, you focus on generalizing your problem, which in this case, would be a problem of the plane’s power-to-weight ratio. Once you find a general solution that addresses this, you can figure out how to apply this general solution to the design of your specific plane.  When solving problems, you should also identify your needs. It’s not always obvious what resources you have and which new resources you might need to complete your task.  If you’re trying to design a plane engine, you probably have tons of different materials available to you – but which ones would work the best? Once you identify that you need a lighter material, you can focus your efforts on finding it.  Have you ever tried to experiment with a favorite recipe, changing details here or there, and ended up with something you had to throw out? Sometimes it’s best to stick to the original recipe. Innovative projects can work the same way. When you have a time frame and a budget, try not to deviate from your plan, as you’ll just trip yourself up if you decide along the line to complicate things.  In 1981, US engineers began work on the F-22 Raptor stealth fighter jet, an advanced piece of machinery conceived to fight Soviet technology. The project however was completed in December 2005 – years after the Soviet Union had collapsed.  So what happened with the project? The F-22 project ran into trouble in 1989 when designers extended the deadline for its completion by six months. They wanted the fighter jet to be “perfect,” so they kept tweaking features, and in the process, adding more costs and further delays.  As a result, the project kept changing to accommodate the added functions, and delays eventually snowballed until the project was a good ten years late.  You can avoid this! Stick firmly to a schedule and budget once they are set. Don’t aim to include every possible feature in a product or project. Try to make something that solves your particular problem, or your project will become irrelevant, just like the F-22.  While designers toiled on the soon-to-be-useless F-22, another invention surpassed it: the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), or as we know it today, the drone.  A drone embodies the F.I.R.E. method: it is fast, inexpensive, restrained and elegant.  The drone project succeeded where the F-22 failed because the project as a whole was focused on answering a specific question in a short time period and on a limited budget. The Dragon Eye drone, for instance, only has one function: surveillance. It is also inexpensive; a Dragon Eye can be produced for roughly $60,000. When you hear the word “innovation,” you might assume it describes something complicated and expensive. That’s not necessarily the case, however. The US space agency NASA shows why.  The US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has launched many innovative missions, given its dedication to simplifying and accelerating projects.  In 1999, for instance, NASA began a spacecraft project called Stardust, aiming to collect particles from the tails of comets in the galaxy and to bring them back for study.  NASA set a tight schedule and budget for Stardust, and completed it on time and under budget, for some million dollars less than what the team had been allocated.  How did they achieve such success? The Stardust team had a clear set of mission requirements, and members focused on the three most important tasks: encounter the comet; collect 1,000 particles; and bring the particles back home.  There were other goals (such as photographing the comet) but these goals were merely desirable – meaning they were secondary to the project’s three main goals.  The success of Stardust also illustrates the importance of focusing innovation to specific needs.  NASA could have built all the elements of the Stardust project from scratch, but the team decided to keep things simple. Project manager Ken Atkins cut costs by using tools developed for previous missions. Stardust’s Motorola Radio, for instance, was originally designed for the 1998 Mars Surveyor mission.  Using established solutions allowed the team to focus efforts on developing tools they didn’t have. In fact, the only real innovation that came from the project was a material for collecting particles, called aerogel. The rest of the project creatively used innovations from the past!  Imagine how awkward it would be to wear every piece of clothing you own. It’s nearly impossible, and even if you did succeed, you’d just look ridiculous.  One shirt, one pair of pants: it’s better to keep things simple.  Innovation is the same. You are guaranteed to stumble if you insist on too much of it for yourself or your project. Keeping it simple doesn’t just look better, however; it’s cheaper and faster, too.  Google’s Chromebook is a good example of this. The laptop comes with only the most commonly used Google features, like searching the internet or using Google Drive.  While Google could have outfitted its laptop with every feature it offers, it would have just cost the company more money and taken more time to develop. A few extra features weren’t enough to justify costs and delays.  Finding the right balance of complexity is called stormdraining. Stormdraining is the opposite of brainstorming: it’s about letting go of concepts or features that don’t provide significant benefit to your project.  To stormdrain, you locate the midpoint between simplicity and complexity; and this point will vary depending on the project. Start by removing one feature from your product at a time. If the system still works, take out another piece. Keep going until you can’t strip any more features and still have a functioning product.  This process takes time and creativity, but it’s much more efficient than building a product that is unnecessarily complex and expensive!  So remember to be critical of your project – get rid of anything that eats up resources and doesn’t provide significant reward. Focus your efforts on developing the tools and products you really need.  The key message in this book: Effective innovation is about focusing energy and resources on your most important tasks. You need to work fast, keep your project inexpensive and stay on track by restraining your budget and time frame. Aim to produce something elegant, not something overly complex. When you streamline your efforts with the F.I.R.E. method, you won’t just finish your project on time, you’ll produce something of higher quality, too.  Got feedback?

You’ll also learn how a marketing debacle paved the way for Coca-Cola’s greatest success; how the experience of failure led Thomas Edison to develop the world’s first recording device; and why Peanuts cartoon character Charlie Brown shouldn’t be a role model. While most of us do our best to avoid failure, most entrepreneurs know better. The majority of successful businesspeople attribute their success to their ability to persevere after failures. In fact, it takes entrepreneurs an average of 3.8 failed ventures before they manage to start a successful business. These entrepreneurs recognize that even if their business eventually fails, they’ll be in a better position than they were when they started. But if their fear of failure had stopped them at the beginning, they wouldn’t have gotten anywhere. In the real world, a single failure doesn’t always mean the end of the road. Take Sergio Zyman, a marketing executive for Coca-Cola in the 1980s. When Zyman launched the new Diet Coke range, it was hugely popular. This success bolstered Zyman’s standing in the company and gave him more confidence in his daring ideas. So later, when Coca-Cola wanted to introduce a new formula for Coke, Zyman proposed to introduce it under the name “New Coke.” Zyman believed the new idea would sell so well that he convinced Coca-Cola to stop producing the old version. To Zyman’s surprise, New Coke was a complete flop. The rebranded bottles failed to sell, costing Coca-Cola approximately $100 million, and Zyman his job. To recover from this blow, Coca-Cola reintroduced their flagship drink under a new name: Coca-Cola Classic. As it turned out, Coca-Cola Classic was a huge hit. The drink became more popular than ever, and Zyman’s failure to transform the brand in the first instance ended up leading to a great success for the company in the long run. In 1993, Coca-Cola chairman Roberto Goizueta rehired Zyman, acknowledging that daring thinkers can’t be right every time. While we largely assume failure can only lead to negative outcomes, the opposite is often true. Many chance discoveries and new opportunities have emerged from failures. This was certainly the case for legendary inventor Thomas Edison. Edison worked for years to improve the telegraph machine, with little success. But along the way, he discovered something else entirely. By making certain adjustments to his failed telegraph machines, he was able to record sound that could be played back again and again. Edison used his lack of success in one pursuit as an opportunity to develop something entirely new. Twentieth-century author William Marston referred to experiences like Edison’s as “drawing dividends from failure.” Marston, who was an inventor as well as a psychologist, believed that this ability was crucial to success. Beyond opening our eyes to new possibilities, failure can be a powerful incentive to work hard and change our lives. Consider the story of the billionaire founder of Home Depot, Bernie Marcus. In 1978, he was fired from his role as CEO of hardware chain Handy Dan as a result of internal conflicts. At the time, Marcus’s parents required his financial support to make ends meet. Marcus was determined never to fall victim to a corporate power struggle again. He enlisted Arthur Blank, a coworker that had also been fired from Handy Dan, and together they opened their own hardware store the following year. Today, their store – Home Depot – is known as one of the most successful retail endeavors in history. Most of the time, failures occur as a result of factors that we can’t control. When that happens, we don’t need to blame ourselves, we just need to take responsibility for finding new solutions. The author recounts the story of his friend, Greg Horn, whose supermarket was destroyed in the 1997 Kentucky floods. Ironically, Horn was insured for almost every type of damage and theft – except flood damage. Obviously, the floods were beyond Horn’s control. But he wasn’t deterred by his unfortunate circumstances. Rather than giving up, Horn took responsibility for his situation and resolved to get his store up and running again as quickly as possible. While continuing to support all 80 of his employees, Horn got to work on fixing the store. The repairs cost him $1 million, but he was able to reopen the store only 21 days after the flood. Horn’s story shows that we can only shape our future by taking responsibility for our circumstances. For another example, think of American tennis player Roger Crawford. Crawford was born without many of his fingers and toes, a condition known as ectrodactylism. In spite of his condition, Crawford took the attitude that he was still responsible for his future. He chased his dream of becoming a professional tennis player, eventually receiving certification from the American Professional Tennis Association as the first American tennis professional with a disability. Crawford attributes his success to the responsibility he takes for his own life, which ran a very different course to another man he knew with ectrodactylism. Unlike Crawford, the man thought of himself as a victim of unfair circumstances, and he felt bitter about the world – an attitude that prevented him from succeeding. Could you imagine starting a new project and aiming to fail? Probably not; most of us prefer to avoid making mistakes. And yet, failure always has the potential to create instructive, even inspiring, learning experiences. The power of embracing failure is illustrated poignantly in an anecdote from David Bayles and Ted Orland’s 1993 book Art and Fear: a ceramics teacher divides her class in two and tells one half that they’ll be graded on the quantity of art they make, and so should make as many pieces as they can. The other half are told to focus on creating one piece, the quality of which will determine their grade. Though the latter group spent longer crafting a single work of art, they were outshone by the first group, which produced pieces of notably higher quality. Because they were able to learn from their mistakes with each subsequent piece they made, the students in the first group were able to develop both their skills and their creative ideas along the way. It’s important to note that we only learn from failure when we’re determined to understand it. One strip from the comic Peanuts reflects on this phenomenon. Charlie Brown is building a sand castle at the beach, which gets flattened by a wave. He looks down at the sand castle and knows there’s something to be learned from the situation – but he doesn’t attempt to figure out what the lesson is. Like Charlie Brown, in the wake of failure many people tell themselves that they don’t have the time or energy to investigate what went wrong. But this simply puts us at risk of making the same mistake again. Identifying the causes of failure allows us to learn, grow and, in Charlie Brown’s case, build sand castles farther away from the waves. When you drive across town, how often do you catch only green lights? Probably never, but that’s alright – it’s just a part of driving. How might life be if we saw our failures as red lights? They might stop us temporarily, but they aren’t a reason to give up on our destination. Failure can feel very discouraging, but this doesn’t have to be the case. Fear of failure is debilitating and can damage our chances of achieving success, so it’s crucial that we fight it at every opportunity. Just consider pioneering American aviator Amelia Earhart’s story. When attempting to fly around the equator, she crashed her plane on takeoff. Despite this, she wasn’t discouraged and pushed on with her flying career. She eventually achieved no less than six world records, including that of the first solo female pilot to fly across the Atlantic. We can also take heart in the fact that we overcome our fear of failure in countless daily activities. Driving a car, for instance, is a dangerous activity, but we do it anyway. In fact, choosing to cycle or stay at home out of fear of having a car crash might even put you at greater risk: a total of 15 and 17 percent of accidents resulting in injuries are linked to cycling and home-based activities, respectively. Our professional lives also provide opportunities to overcome our fear of failure and act. Suggesting a daring strategy or proposing to take on more responsibility are great ways to confront your fear of failure and earn the respect of your team, too. Refusing to take risks, on the other hand, is more likely to leave your team members feeling like you’re, at best, unambitious, and at worst, lazy. Taking risks inevitably leads to failure some of the time, but by embracing this, you’ll be more likely to win big in the long run. Learning to embrace and overcome failure opens up new opportunities for success. But to be able to use these opportunities, you’ll need to practice three things: goal-setting, people skills and a positive mindset. American writer Don Marquis noted that while most people don’t truly know what they want, they’re still willing to sweat blood to get it. The trick to success is channeling this desire for change into well-defined objectives. So, rather than simply complaining that you’re tired of working, set goals that’ll allow you to create a better lifestyle. For example, you could invest in property to create a passive income that’ll allow you to retire sooner. Along with goal-setting, outstanding people skills can carry you to success. Today, most jobs, projects and goals can only be achieved by mobilizing stakeholders, investors, teams and employees. By spending time working on your communication, negotiation and conversational skills, you’ll be better able to win the support of your peers and open up new opportunities for achieving your ambitions. Finally, maintaining a positive mindset gives you an immediate advantage. Learning to see the value in even the most trying of experiences can be the difference between giving up and persevering. American author W. Clement Stone once told the story of a girl who, after moving across America to join her husband, became dissatisfied with her new life. In a letter written by her mother, the girl learned of an old anecdote about two men in prison. When one looked up from the prison bars, he saw mud. When the other looked up, he saw stars. The girl realized that while she was unable to change her situation in life, she was able to change her attitude toward it. By adopting a positive outlook, she learned to discover new opportunities that her dissatisfaction had blinded her to. The key message in this book: Failure is inevitable, but it can also be beneficial. From revealing new ideas and pushing us to become our best, to helping us learn about our weaknesses, experiences of failure provide us with valuable opportunities. Along with clear goal-setting and a positive mindset, embracing failure is key to unlocking success.  Actionable Advice Seek out stories of failure that inspire you.  Is there an entrepreneur, leader or dreamer that inspires you, from the past or present? Though their successes might be what makes them a role model to you, try spending some time researching their lives to find out more about their failed ideas as well. Not only will this give you a deeper understanding of their successes, their missteps might also offer an inspiring lesson or two. Got feedback?

Ferracone","summary":"Are you familiar with the notion of aligned pay? If not, here’s a chance to get acquainted with an important element in business compensation. Aligned pay has to do with the amount of compensation a company pays its executives. And crucially, that amount, whether stocks, bonuses or otherwise, needs to be fair. But what is fair? These blinks will help you better understand what you should do when setting executive compensation and show you how you can bring your company’s pay scales back to earth. In these blinks, you’ll learn when a generous compensation package does more harm than good; which factors you should consider when setting executive compensation; and why, for successful executives, cash is just one element of a great position. Imagine you’re an account manager on a team of three employees. Even though you all work equally diligently, you find out that your two colleagues are paid a higher salary than you. Such a situation would be unfair, right? Unfair pretty much explains the state of executive compensation today. Executives are routinely overcompensated, and compensation plans seldom take into account CEO performance. Consider that John Chambers, the CEO of Cisco Systems – one of the world’s biggest telecom companies – each year “earned,” in addition to his $300,000 salary, from $5 million to $6 million worth of stock options and a $400,000 bonus. That’s way too much money – no executive can perform that well! But performance isn’t all a compensation plan should consider to be fair. It also should reflect what other CEOs earn in the same market. Industry standards vary, and each industry is subject to different external forces. For instance, the energy sector is sensitive to oil prices, while the tech industry reacts to inventory levels in the IT supply chain. Such external factors are important, as they can affect the overall performance of any executive. That’s why it’s important for CEO pay to reflect the compensation of peers in the same industry. This way, if an oil crisis drives prices through the roof, the CEO of an energy firm won’t be blamed for the company’s poor returns. Even if the CEO’s performance was above reproach, it wouldn’t make sense to base the executive’s compensation on that of technology CEOs working in a booming market. We all make decisions on a whim. As a result, we set goals that we can’t keep, and thus abandon those goals without thought. This sort of behavior works to distort executive compensation schemes. Decisions made randomly and outside original plans undermine fair pay strategies. Here’s why. Executive compensation should be based on a plan that dictates how much a person’s pay will change based on certain future events, such as a company merger. Such plans are obviously set well in advance; yet even so, events or arbitrary decisions can easily unhinge a well-made plan. For instance, let’s say a sitting CEO decides to retire after 20 years. While her contract already had a specific plan set out in case of retirement, the company board, on a whim, decides to grant the CEO extra stock options. The result? A far too generous compensation plan! In a similar way, adjusting compensation based on economic events without considering a company’s long-term business strategy will also lead to compensation that is unfair. This is why, instead of reacting to externalities and shifting plans, companies should always stick with the established plan and overall corporate strategy. Here’s a telling example. One company decided to change its executive pay scheme from a generous package including a base salary, bonuses and stock to just payment in stock – a choice that resulted in a dramatically lower total compensation. Why the change? The company made the decision in 2008, the year of the global financial crisis. Executives were responding to external events and ignoring overall business strategy. So now you know if you don’t stick to a plan, your compensation scheme will suffer. Have you ever heard the term illusory superiority? This is a psychological phenomenon in which an individual believes that his successes are a result of his hard work but his failures the fault of external forces. The same tendency can apply to companies. Corporations often believe that management is cleverer, more capable and generally “better” than employees at lower levels. This belief translates into executives earning far more than they really should. As a result, while a company with mediocre management may perform well just because the overall economy is robust, executives will still “earn” a bonus as a reward. Yet that same company will attribute any difficulties to other factors, such as an overall economic slowdown – not to company leadership! Another assumption that stilts executive pay is applying a one-size-fits-all mentality to compensation methods. This was the case in the 1990s and 2000s when many firms across the United States believed that executives of publicly traded companies should be paid similarly to managers at top private equity firms. This was a huge mistake; public and private firms are not the same beast. For instance, the evaluation of a public company is determined on a daily basis in the open market. Executives of public firms need to satisfy the demands of shareholders over an extended period, independently of when they purchased stock. Privately held companies, on the other hand, give executives a fraction of company equity when they come on board, which they can sell at a later date. Failing to account for this difference means that executives in publicly traded companies were overcompensated. They were compensated on a compensation model designed for short time periods (the private firms) when they should’ve been compensated based on a longer-term strategy that public firms require. We often think that there’s no problem money can’t solve, especially when it comes to compensation. If you pay someone a sufficient amount of cash, that person will strive to perform well, period. As a result, executive committees tend to overpay executives just to keep them in the top office, even if it means creating economic chaos within the company. During the 2008 financial crisis, for instance, some companies, fearing executive flight, refrained from cutting high executive salaries even as company revenue plummeted. Worse was that some companies promised executives generous stock option packages to stay the course, even though doing so would cause the company severe economic stress. Such decisions are unreasonable, as they inevitably lead to a misallocation of resources. Money used for executive pay could be channeled toward more productive projects, such as research and development. In fact, money is rarely as essential to retaining top talent as companies think. While many companies believe compensation is the greatest motivating factor, it’s just one of many elements that make an executive feel satisfied with her position. Other factors include how challenging the job is, how much the position allows her to grow professionally and whether and her reputation will improve with the new job. In fact, the majority of people hired for top positions aren’t interested in just money. Rather, such executives come on board because they believe in the work the company does, the vision it has and the people who work there. They want to help cement the company’s place in history. As a result, few executives change jobs for a bump in pay. When they do leave, it’s usually to take the next career step. We now know that executive pay is plagued by fairness problems. But what can be done? Just like a street map tells you whether to turn right or left, an alignment report can help guide your decisions regarding executive compensation. This report helps you determine whether a particular level of compensation is “aligned” with an executive’s overall value. An alignment report shows how much value an executive creates for a company and determines how much the executive should be paid relative to competitors in the market. A report might compare Company X to Company Y, for example, two companies involved in the auto industry. In 2015, Company X performed well under talented leadership, increasing revenue by 23 percent; its CEO was paid $180,000. That same year, Company Y, of comparable size and market share to Company X, didn’t do as well. Revenue grew by 8 percent; its CEO was paid $175,000. By comparing performance and industry, it’s plain to see that Company Y’s CEO was overcompensated. An alignment report can also show you if a given compensation design is fair. Compensation design is the way a company decides how its executives are paid, whether through a system of bonuses, stock grants or a combination thereof. To remain fair, such a design should compensate an executive according to performance relative to other executives in the same field. Thus if most CEOs at competing companies are paid a fixed monthly salary, your CEO is overpaid if he’s receiving a fixed monthly bonus on top of his salary – that is, as long as he’s generating the same amount of value as other CEOs in the same industry. Simply put, to determine whether executive compensation is fair, consider the value created by your executives and compare it to that created by those at competing firms. The key message in this book: Executive pay is out of hand, and something needs to be done. For the compensation of top management to be fair, it should be based on performance and be relative to that of executives in similar positions and at similar companies, catering to similar markets.

Faced with too many options, and with no idea what the future holds, it often feels best just to ignore the situation. On top of that, humans are full of blind spots and biases, and future outcomes can be too bewilderingly complex to anticipate. Thankfully, there are plenty of techniques that can help us work around this hard-wired hindrance. They can be applied in everyday situations or even monumental decisions that need a lot of time to process. Depending on your disposition, better decision-making can be as precise as a mathematical model or as simple as mulling it over. In these blinks you’ll learn how George Washington fell prey to faulty reasoning; why President Reagan’s approach to decision-making helps Liberals; and why mulling things over will never go out of style. In the summer of 1776, the Revolutionary War in North America was in full swing. The Americans, led by George Washington, sought to break free from the shackles of British rule. But the British refused to let go. As they massed their navy with New York in their sights, Washington was left in a quandary. Although it was clear that an attack was coming, it was less clear how the British would launch it. This lesson from history demonstrates just how complex decision-making in real-life situations can be. Washington was faced with what’s known as a full-spectrum decision. That means numerous factors had to be taken into account for the right decision to be made. In the battle for New York, Washington had a lot to think about. Where were there landing sites for British ships on the New York coast? What effect would the strong currents of the East River have in moving his own troops from New York to Brooklyn? Washington also had to consider the damage British cannons could do against New York’s fortifications and the potential risk of life for his own soldiers in pitched battle. He even had to consider the internal American politics in the Continental Congress, which demanded that he stand firm against the British. Needless to say, Washington had a tough time deciding what to do, and eventually, he found himself making the wrong decision. He actually erred in the very first one he made. He shouldn’t even have tried to defend New York at all. Since the superior British outnumbered his forces, it would have been much easier to retreat inland. But this mistake is not unique to Washington – we are often prone to forget our blind spots when making decisions. There’s a name for this common error in human reasoning. It’s known as loss aversion. Studies repeatedly show it to be a characteristic innate to humans. We prefer to resist losses than to seek gains, even when it’d be better in the long run to do the opposite. Washington, however, was smart enough not to stick it out until his troops were completely crushed. Once his forces began to lose, he quickly signaled the retreat. He was still a born leader, and the Revolutionary War would eventually be won, despite the many difficult decisions along the way. As a general rule, governments and corporations function as hierarchies; the bosses make the important decisions. Unfortunately, that’s often not how the best decisions are made. In reality, complex decisions need to be supported by many points of view. The water department for the Greater Vancouver area is a good example here. Faced with population growth, they needed to expand the freshwater resources available. This called for some complex decision-making. Resource options included using three existing reservoirs, building a pipeline to far-off lakes or drilling well fields alongside a nearby river. To make the right decision, the department took numerous perspectives into consideration. That meant asking people living near the potential sources, indigenous tribes with sacred connections to the waters, environmental organizations, as well as health and water-security specialists. A solution was found that satisfied all – a mile long, earthquake-secure pipeline built to draw water from a dam on the Coquitlam River. This sort of broad approach to problem-solving leads to better decisions. That’s because the possible advantages and disadvantages of each solution are clarified as part of the process. In short, a diversity of perspectives ensures better decision-making. This is also backed up by a series of studies conducted by psychologist Samuel Sommer around 2010. He created mock trials to test juries’ decision-making processes. The results showed that racially mixed juries were overwhelmingly better at doing their job than white-only juries. Diverse juries spotted more interpretations of evidence submitted, were more accurate in recalling the facts of the case and had longer and more forensic deliberations. On the other hand, ethnically homogenous groups made decisions too hastily and did so without questioning biased assumptions. Scientists have extrapolated from this that the same is probably true of homogeneity in general, whether that be of gender or political orientation. However, further studies are needed to substantiate that view. Decision-making would be pretty easy if we already knew what the future holds. If you were aware of where real estate prices were going to skyrocket in twenty years, it would be a no-brainer to buy property there. Unfortunately, humans are dreadful at guessing the future. The political scientist Philip Tetlock demonstrated this more than 20 years ago in his “forecasting tournaments.” In these, participants competed against others to predict what the future held for subjects like the environment or gender relations. The questions posited looked at long-term political and economic developments – would a member of the European Union leave it within the decade, or would the US experience an economic downturn in the next five years? Tetlock collected 28,000 predictions from these forecasting tournaments and then waited to find out their accuracy. At the same time, he compared those predictions with two very simple algorithmic predictions. One algorithm forecasted no change, while the other indicated that change would continue at the current rate. With grim inevitability, human predictions were almost always less accurate than the standard forecast predicting the continuation of current trends. So much for the average Joe. But what about experts? Well, it turned out that they were particularly poor at predicting the future. Incredibly, experts in economics and politics did worse in Tetlock’s experiment than people with no specialized knowledge! That might seem surprising, but non-experts did better because they took a broad view, taking various factors into account. This is a characteristic found among the best forecasters of the future. When asked about the health of the economy in five years, generalists considered market trends, but also technological innovation, education, farming practices, population growth and more. Experts, on the other hand, just couldn’t break out of their own fields. Their specialist, personal opinions meant they made wildly inaccurate predictions. Economists, for instance, were either convinced that capitalism would crumble or that growth would reach unprecedented levels. There are good reasons why predicting future events is so difficult, and we’ll learn more about this in the next blink. When it comes to envisaging the development of current trends, humans tend to believe that things will just go on as they are indefinitely. Unfortunately, as a rule of thumb, that doesn’t always hold true – chaos and unpredictability cannot be dismissed when anticipating the future. George Orwell was no different in his assumptive forecasting when writing his famous near-future dystopia, 1984. He began writing the novel in 1944, when Nazi power had taken hold in Europe. He had witnessed the rise of fascism in previous decades, as well, so it made sense that he foresaw the continued trend of dictatorial systems of government. But – thankfully – that didn’t turn out to be the case. In reality, future events occur because various factors converge. And these, by nature, are frequently unforeseeable. Consider the largely unanticipated rise of the personal computer. Computers, as we know them, came to exist because various breakthroughs in numerous fields all converged simultaneously. Mathematics and robotics made great strides forward, while advances in microwave signal processing and silicon circuits also developed. If you’d wanted to predict the rise of computers, it would have been necessary to know that developments in mathematics would massively expand the potential of computer programming languages. Equally, you’d have to have surmised that silicon circuits would be better than the vacuum tubes used in old-fashioned computers. Finally, you’d have to have known that older technologies, like radio waves, would be repurposed to transmit binary information. Needless to say, almost no one was in a position to predict what would later become not only possible, but commonplace. As we have seen, predicting the future is no easy task. With that said, there are still techniques that can help in prediction and decision-making. One increasingly popular method used for predicting the future is using red teams. A red team is a group that is created within an organization. The team acts as though it were the ‘enemy’ when the larger organization is in the process of making strategic decisions. For instance, an army unit might be considering the options open to them for launching an effective attack. Once they’ve formulated their plans, they’ll pass them onto a red team. The red team will then enter fully into the mind of the enemy and map out all the different ways they could counter a potential attack. Using red teams has proven highly effective in a variety of spheres. Famously, they were instrumental in the decision-making that resulted in the operation that led to the death of Osama Bin Laden in May 2011. Early in 2011, the American National Counterterrorism Center was drawing up plans to storm a mysterious compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. It was there they suspected Osama Bin Laden was in hiding. The assembled red team reckoned that there was only a 50/50 chance Bin Laden would be found in the compound. But, more critically, their input meant the US government was better prepared for the unexpected. It was actually the red team that spotted the issue that having an unauthorized American army aircraft crossing Pakistani airspace might cause problems. Consequently, in the months before the attack, the government worked on diplomatic ties with Russia and with the shipping network in the Baltic Sea – all so that the covert squad would have an additional route in and out of Pakistan. There was a chance they would need it if the Pakistani government reacted aggressively to the covert operation. Of course, they found Bin Laden in the compound. The preparation of the red team helped make the mission more robust. Ronald Reagan’s legacy as a US president is largely defined by his conservative agenda. Just think of his professed desire to cut taxes and government spending, as well as bolster the military. What’s less known, though, are his ideas that found bipartisan support, most notably his advocacy of cost-benefit analysis in decision-making. In February 1981, Reagan signed an Executive Order. This necessitated a cost-benefit analysis to be conducted for every new regulation under governmental consideration. This analysis required that potential benefits and costs of a putative new regulation be listed. Critically, that remit stretched beyond monetary terms. Proposed measures had to demonstrate the overall benefit. Finally, alternatives to the regulation had to be examined to ensure the best solution was the one being executed. Cost-benefit analysis is demonstrably for the good. And nowhere is this clearer than in environmental protection. Under the Obama administration, cost-benefit analysis was used to support the argument for increasing environmental protection. Simply, the social costs of carbon dioxide emissions were calculated. Experts from the Office of Energy and Climate Change, the Council on Environmental Quality and many other governmental departments and agencies sat down together to work out the long-term effects and costs of the carbon that was being released into the atmosphere. Envisaged social costs included reduced agricultural yields, catastrophic weather events and forced population migration due to rising sea levels. The experts concluded that the social cost was $36 per ton of carbon dioxide released. Even though many external parties thought that this was still too conservative a calculation, it was the first time environmental costs had been monetized by the US government. It was the first step to ensuring the issue would be taken more seriously in governmental decision-making in the future. Sometimes decision-making requires making some tough calls. Fortunately, there are tools that can help. Linear value modeling, a method used in statistics, can assist in complex decision-making.  Linear value modeling maps out possible options and weighs them according to the value you’ve given them. Imagine you're deciding whether or not to get married. Value-based considerations might include finances, the possibility of having children, the value of free time alone and the desire for a life companion. For each consideration, you would assign a value calculated on the likelihood of satisfaction based respectively on marrying or not. So, your chances of having a child might be 30% if you stay single, but 70% if you marry. You then weigh each possible outcome. The weighting scale goes from 0 to 1, where 0 is ‘unimportant’ and 1 is ‘very important.’ So, if the idea of having children appeals to you, it might score 0.75, whereas you might give your freedom a weight of 0.25. You’d then multiply those weightings by the relevant likelihood percentages calculated earlier. Once you’ve done the sums, you’ll know which decision is the one you should opt for. And the uses of linear value modeling don’t stop with humans. The process can also help machines make decisions. Most likely, as self-driving cars become more common, they’ll start relying on linear value modeling. They’ll need it to work out the merits of outcomes based on given maneuvers, as well as the probability of those outcomes actually occurring. Imagine a pedestrian jumping out into a bidirectional right-hand-traffic road as a self-driving car approaches. The car must now assess the situation and make a choice. If it swerves to the right, there’ll be less chance of colliding with another vehicle, but an increased risk of hitting the pedestrian. This could easily be fatal for the pedestrian, so avoiding this outcome likely has a large weight in the car’s value system. If the car is not driving too quickly, it may prefer to swerve left. It’s quite likely that it will hit another vehicle, but as this would be unlikely to cause fatalities, the car has a lower weight on avoiding this outcome. If mathematical decision-making is such a great idea, then you might think that only those who are able to do the sums are capable of making good decisions. But thankfully, that’s not the case. Those who are less mathematically minded can also make great decisions, simply by doing a little ruminating. If you think about it, making a decision functions much like mathematical analysis. By mulling something over, you’re considering different options available to you over an extended period of time. The key is to allow yourself enough time to do this. That way, you won't forget important variables or overlook an option that might resolve the current set of conflicting advantages and disadvantages. Once you've taken all possibilities into account, it’s important to give yourself a rest. Take some time out. Go for a long walk or get creative, just make sure you allow your mind to wander. This gives the brain’s default system – the part that processes stuff in the background while you’re doing everyday tasks – the time to filter through all that information and shape an informed intuitive decision.   The other advantage of mulling things over is that mathematical decision-making has its limits. Let’s return to the strike on Osama bin Laden’s compound. Irrespective of the work done by the red team, there was no mathematically certain way to calculate whether Bin Laden was actually there or not. It was the slow process of careful consideration and examining the situation from all sides that allowed the Obama administration to make assumptions about Bin Laden’s location. Mathematically, they knew there was only a 50 percent chance of Bin Laden really being there, so it was intuition that saved the day. We’ve learnt a lot. Making decisions is never easy, and even math can't always get you to the finish line. But if you do a few sums and take the time to mull the variables and outcomes over, you’ll be well on your way to making a sound and informed decision. The key message in these blinks: Decision-making is difficult for each and every one of us. That’s because humans have a hard time predicting what the future outcome of any given decision will be and whether we will be happy with that outcome. That’s why it’s important to take the time to make decisions. Both the traditional approach of just chewing things over or a more technical and mathematical approach of mapping out all options and variables can be useful.  Actionable advice: Build diverse teams.  As you’ve seen in these blinks, the more diverse a group is, the better decisions they make. So the next time you’re putting together, say, a project team, make a conscious effort to include people with diverse backgrounds. The added breadth of experience will help the group make more representative decisions, thereby producing better results. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

What to read next: Where Good Ideas Come From, by Steven Johnson You’ve just learned how complex decision-making can be. What seemed like a no-brainer can turn out to be a truly terrible decision. Something similar is true for ideas. That flash of the proverbial light bulb, so promising in its allure, can just as suddenly fizzle out. So where do truly good ideas come from? In Where Good Ideas Come From, you’ll see how some of the greatest advances in technology and science have come about in the context of biological and evolutionary history. Moreover, you’ll see how individual and organizational creativity can be acquired. So if you’re interested in the world of ideas or wishing to increase your own creativity, head over to the blinks of Where Good Ideas Come From.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

Azzarelli","summary":"Over the course of the last century, women have gained considerable economic and political power; they’ve inched closer to achieving equal rights and started conquering the workplace. Indeed, women today are a force to be reckoned with, and powerful women in all spheres of public life use their influence to push women's rights even further. In other words, it seems like we’re approaching a truly equal society, right? Unfortunately, that’s not really the case. Globally, women must struggle for the rights and recognition that men take for granted – such basics as respect, freedom and independence. But the situation isn’t hopeless. As more and more women occupy positions of economic power, and as they gain recognition as a demographic brimming with economic potential, we may soon witness the fast-forward change that will put women where they should be: on an equal footing with everyone else. In these blinks, you’ll find out that having three or more female board members increases returns by 50 percent; that a mere 4.4 percent of all US business loans went to female entrepreneurs; and how Grameen Bank has helped women increase their independence. Just a few decades ago, it wasn’t unusual to hear statements like, “Women shouldn’t vote or drive cars and God knows they don’t belong in politics.” Disturbingly, such sentiments still predominate in some countries. The world is changing, however: women are gaining more power and having a greater impact on society. In recent years there have been more female leaders, such as German chancellor Angela Merkel, American Presidential Nominee Hillary Clinton and Christine Lagarde, head of the IMF. Those women fought hard to make it in a male-dominated world and they’re leveling the playing field with their success. Women are also making strides in the world of business. In 2014, the United States had around nine million women-owned businesses that employed over 7.9 million workers and made over 1.4 trillion dollars in revenue. If, for instance, Egypt’s workforce contained as many women as men, the country’s GDP would rise by about 34 percent. In fact, women are likely to be the force that drives this century’s global development. About a billion women are ready to enter the global economy – a number comparable to the population of China or India. These women will start new businesses, change the political landscape and increase the quality of life for both their families and their communities. In the future we’ll also have more female entrepreneurs and business leaders, which will change the business environment. This is already happening and having a positive impact: studies show that Fortune 500 companies with three or more female board members have a 50 percent higher equity return than those all-male boards. We’re on the brink of a major shift in global power. Women are truly poised to change the world. Women may have massive global potential, but, in most countries, they’re still barred from opportunity and considered inferior. This mistreatment and subjugation comes in many forms. Sexual violence, for instance, is still one of the foremost dangers faced by women. Assault, rape, human trafficking, female genital mutilation, child marriage and sex slavery are more widespread than most would think – even in Western countries. And in some countries, such as Afghanistan, women can be raped as a form of punishment – sometimes for things their male family members have done, and sometimes by their male family members. Women are even sometimes killed to maintain their family honor. Even in safer countries like the United States, a man can stalk or assault a woman and face virtually no consequences. In fact, over 30 percent of American women have suffered some form of violence – such as assault, rape or stalking – at the hands of males with whom they were intimate. Women themselves play the main role in fighting such malicious social customs and phallocentric double standards. Though facing horrendous odds, women across the globe are standing up and striving for a world without gendered violence. Female leaders have succeeded in criminalizing sexual violence with motions like the US Violence Against Women Act of 1994. Other organizations, such as Girls Not Brides, which aims to empower young girls and women, are fighting to end the culture of child marriage. The continent with the highest incidence of child brides is Africa. According to the United Nations Population Fund, about 75 percent of all women in Niger were married before their eighteenth birthday. But despite the fantastic work of such organizations, and the major progress toward global gender equality they’ve made possible, there is still a lot of work to be done. Most people subconsciously picture a man when they hear the term “CEO.” That’s not only because of how we’re socialized; it reflects reality, too. Most CEOs are men. There are more than a few reasons this needs to change. Companies actually become stronger and more profitable when they place women in executive positions, a fact that few companies take advantage of. Few Fortune 500 companies have women in high executive positions. For women, there’s a so-called glass ceiling, an invisible and unofficial barrier that stands between them and a company’s top positions. In the United States, only five percent of CEOs and 3.1 percent of board chairs are women. Companies that resist this trend reap the rewards, however. Studies have shown that Fortune 500 companies with strong female senior partners are between 18 to 69 percent more profitable than other Fortune 500 companies in the same industry. Women should also have more representation in middle management, where they could foster greater innovation and inspiration. That’s because new and innovative projects usually start in middle management. Middle management employees are the ones who interact most directly with the customers and thus get most attuned to their wishes. They also maintain contact with employees at higher levels, serving as a bridge between the customers and the executive branch. That means women in middle management are in a unique position to promote more gender-oriented strategies across the entire company. They’re the ones who know how to connect with female customers and represent their ideas to those at the top. Bea Perez, the chief sustainability officer at Coca-Cola, believes wholeheartedly in this strategy. She argues that groundbreaking ideas come from all levels of the company – not just the upper management. We certainly need more women in leadership positions; however, that doesn’t mean neglecting those at the base of society. Women at lower levels of the workforce – or those not in the workforce at all – are just as important to global development. There are millions of impoverished female farmers in rural areas and millions of women toiling away in garment factories for virtually no pay. Their lives and well-being are constantly under threat; many can’t even read. In fact, women account for around 70 percent of the global population that lives in poverty. Women need financial support and job training to break this cycle. Many people have come up with potential solutions. One such solution, microcredits, aims to give women economic autonomy by granting them small loans. The Grameen Bank in India offers microcredits as low as $27 for women who want to start small businesses. They’ve experienced great success: the Grameen Bank’s return rates are through the roof and participating women report that the microcredits massively have improved their quality of life as well as the living standards of their communities. The bank has distributed over 16 million dollars in microcredits to female entrepreneurs. Companies and other organizations are also starting to recognize the power of their female clientele base. Avon, the world-famous beauty company, has started training women sellers, known as the Avon Ladies, to do more than sell products: they also learn to spread information about health, domestic violence and other important issues to women in rural areas. In Brazil, for instance, the Avon Ladies went to areas with limited health-care services and taught women how to examine themselves for breast cancer. Female empowerment isn’t only good for women. As more and more women gain power in society, something important and marvelous happens: the multiplier effect. The multiplier effect says that when you empower one woman, you empower many. Since, until recently, so many women have had so few chances, the empowerment of one woman triggers a chain reaction. Female leaders are more likely to help other women gain access to education and financial security; this, in turn, will create more female leaders, who will then empower more women. Helena Morrissey, the CEO of Newton Investment Management, is one such powerful leader. She founded the 30% Club, which aims to raise to 30 percent the number of female board members in FTSE-100 companies, the companies on the London Stock Exchange with the highest market capitalization. Female empowerment also means that women will have more capital to spend on those around them. When a woman in a poor, rural area is able to earn more money, she’s likely to invest it in her children’s future by providing them with a better education and health care than she herself had access to. And this has a positive impact on the economy at large. Unfortunately, in some parts of the world, starting a business or earning credit are privileges denied to women. But there are programs aimed at combating this problem. The Gates Foundation and Coca-Cola, for instance, started a joint project called Project Nurture. Project Nurture provided 53,000 farmers in Uganda and Kenya with basic training in business and mango production. In just four years, the project helped some women increase their income by over 140 percent. One might think that it’s only women in poor countries who truly struggle. However, women in developed countries also face serious obstacles in the business world. Many female entrepreneurs have difficulty securing sufficient credit, for example, which is a vital part of founding a business. Many assume that banks treat men and women equally in Western countries; that, however, is a patently misguided assumption. Denied the credit so liberally granted to their male counterparts, female entrepreneurs often struggle to make ends meet. In fact, only 4.4 percent of all business loans in the United States go to female business owners. In other words, they granted one dollar for every 23 dollars loaned to male business owners. Fortunately this gap is starting to close, largely because female leaders are working to provide their fellow women with more capital. Belle Capital, for example, is a women-led venture capitalist group that focuses on funding new businesses with female leaders or owners. In order to qualify for Belle Capital, businesses need at least one female chief officer or a clear commitment to recruiting more women for senior positions. Women can truly build and inspire life-changing new enterprises when given the chance. When young, educated women start new businesses, they’re often more socially responsible than male entrepreneurs. Some develop female-oriented programs, like opportunities for young mothers-to-be, while others spearhead initiatives aimed at protecting the environment. Still others try to find ethical solutions to global problems. Fresh Paper, founded by Kavita Shukla, is an example of this. Fresh Paper is an environmentally friendly way of keeping food cool. NGOs often order it in regions that lack electricity to prevent food spoilage and illness. Having a sense of purpose in life is just as important as finding happiness. Everyone wants to do something meaningful that will make the world a slightly better place. Naturally, this applies equally to women and men! Women also need space to figure out what they want to do with their lives, whether that means becoming a successful leader, a politician or a stay-at-home mom. People who live without a sense of purpose never truly feel fulfilled; they might while away their life doing something they don’t truly care about. Pam Seagle, a former senior marketing executive for Bank of America, found her purpose after a rather arduous journey. After miraculously surviving a plane crash, she radically shifted the direction of her life. Instead of focusing on her own career, she committed herself to helping other women further theirs. Today, Seagle uses her knowledge of the banking sector to mentor young female leaders who want to make it in the business world. Once you find a purpose, you’ll naturally find like-minded people. Seagle didn’t launch her mentoring project at Bank of America on her own. She networked and held numerous meetings with other feminist activists until she had enough support to get her project up and running. Seagle collaborated with Anne Finucane, the global chief strategy and marketing officer, and her deputy, Rena DeSisto. Today, their Global Ambassadors Program helps women all over the world, in countries like Haiti, South Africa and India. Once you know what it is you’re working toward, you’ll naturally find a network of like-minded individuals. Building a strong network is a key part of achieving any meaningful goal. A young girl from a remote village in Kenya will have few opportunities to learn about the global fight for gender equality. She’s more likely to be married off at a young age, undergo female circumcision and then have children before she’s mature enough to care for them. Such are the obstacles to global gender equality. However, we have to start somewhere, and education is key. Education enables girls to understand their own rights and power, and equips them to empower those around them. Education has its risks, however. Malala Yousafzai was shot in the head by the Taliban for fighting for female education rights in Pakistan. She miraculously survived and now fights even harder for women’s rights in education. For her efforts, she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014. After education, the next step is greater access to technology. Technology becomes more important every day in our modern world and it can enable women to educate themselves, enter the global economy and bring about meaningful change for their families and communities. The project Girls Who Code, for example, offers science and IT classes to young women; the aim is to afford them greater access to future technologies and industries. Girls Who Code’s goal is to reach over one million young women by 2020. Women should have greater representation in the media, too. Influential media players have made great strides in this area, but they still need to step up their game. Actors like Meryl Streep and Angelina Jolie, for instance, are using their power to advocate for more gender equality in the arts. They hope to inspire more women to stand up for themselves by pushing for more books, plays and films depicting the struggles of women. All in all, global feminism has made amazing progress, particularly in the last few decades. Nonetheless, there’s still much to be done before we achieve a truly equal world. The key message in this book: Women, with their potential to fuel economic and social growth, are sure to be the most powerful force of the century. But despite this power, many women are still held back by widespread sexism and social dogmas – even in Western countries. Women face challenges all across the globe, from sex trafficking to assault to glass ceilings. Fortunately, we can overcome these problems with education and productive uses of technology and media. Women’s rights have come a long way, but still have a ways to go.  Actionable advice: Women! Have confidence in your own strengths and skills.  You are capable of more than you realize. Do you want to start a business? An education initiative? Another kind of project? Feeling scared? Don’t be. The only way to know if you can succeed in those endeavors is to try. You never know – you might end up changing the world.

Now – more than ever – creativity is absolutely vital for a successful work environment. If you want your business to succeed, you need to know how to recruit talented and imaginative people, and how to support them once you've got them. Finding the Next Steve Jobs is about that process. These blinks will teach you how to find creative individuals – sometimes in unusual places. You'll learn how to foster an atmosphere that can support your employees' imaginations, and pave the way for them to realize great ideas. You'll also learn: how hiring high school dropouts exclusively for a month can boost your company; why Atari put couches and showers in their offices; how hiring arrogant or annoying people can be a good idea; why the author hired the inventor of the joystick because of his love for model trains; why you should reward a person's failures; how the Atari employees got one of their best game ideas while at a party; and how managers are most effective when they never say no. A good work environment is vital for creativity. A cold, bland environment just can't inspire people like an interactive and exciting one can. There are many ways a company can foster a creative atmosphere. First off, the workplace needs to be fun and interesting for the employees. One good way to spice up the workplace is to make use of positive and exciting secrets, because creative people have a particular love of secrets. Apple employees, for example, aren't allowed to discuss the next Apple product with their friends outside the company. This builds anticipation, and also makes the employees closer; it's fun to be part of a group that shares secrets. The workplace must also be free of stifling rules. Instead, rules should be flexible and accommodating. Atari adjusted their policies to accodomate their employees when Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak worked for them. They had initially prohibited sleeping on the premises, for security purposes. Jobs and Wozniak, however, insisted on it. They liked working late into the night and sleeping only a few hours, then continuing in the morning. So Atari changed the rules for them. Soon other employees wanted to stay late as well, so Atari added showers and couches to make them comfortable. Companies can attract top talent by being fun, flexible and engaging in this way. It's also crucial to promote the company's creativity when advertising vacant positions. Highlight the most compelling parts of the job. The author, for example, gave Atari employees a summer off every seven years. The advertisement for the position read, “Frolic a whole summer every seven years, full pay.” You can also use bold strategies to reach out to those who work for rival companies. Red 5 Studios, a computer game developer, poached employees from their competition by sending them iPods with personalized messages encouraging them to join. Unusual or intriguing strategies like this are certain to engage creative people. Have you ever met the perfect waitress? The author did once, in a pizza restaurant. He was so impressed with her social skills that he hired her on the spot to develop new marketing programs. She brought her positive energy to the new job and performed very well. Sometimes you can find creative and passionate people right under your nose, just like this. Most of the time, however, you'll need to go out and search for them. Luckily, there are many good strategies for searching. First, keep a look out for creative communities – places where creative people seek each other out. Companies can use them as a source of inspiration, and a place to find new employees. The annual Hackers Conference, a creative community, is a meeting point for some of the smartest people in technology. The author attends the event regularly himself, and also sends employees there to pick up new ideas, promote Atari and scout for potential employees. You can also use Twitter to find people who are especially passionate about certain topics. For example, imagine you need a new public relations employee who's good at communicating technical information. You can simply look for someone on Twitter who fits the profile, and go over his or her Tweets to decide if you'd like to contact the Tweeter. Finally, use your existing employees as sources of referrals. Creative people tend to associate with other creative people, so employees and ex-colleagues can be helpful for finding new talent. The author hired three of his best employees, including the inventor of Pong, from his previous employer, Ampex. Steve Jobs also hired people from Atari when he left the company. Employers often seek out pleasant people to hire, believing they make good employees. That's often true, but sometimes unpleasant employees are even better. Arrogant people, for example, can be extremely annoying – especially if they act like they're smarter than everyone else. However, if they actually are that smart, they may be able to achieve incredible feats. Steve Jobs fit the bill. He always believed he was right. That could be frustrating to his colleagues, but it gave him the willpower to push for his ideas, and make them a reality. So, if you want to find the best workers, you've got to look for all sorts. Don't be afraid to hire people who are a bit bizarre. Creative people and their innovations may seem absurd sometimes, but some of the greatest business ideas in the past few decades were initially considered ridiculous. For example, when Sara Blakely came up with Spanx – pantyhose with the bottom cut off – people thought she was crazy. Today she is a billionaire. Some of the author's best employees were people who wouldn't have been able to get a job in more traditional companies like IBM. Harold Lee, for example, who went on to develop the chip for Pong, drove a Harley Davidson, and never washed his long hair or beard. So remember to look for diversity when you're hiring. Seek out diversity on the inside. Many companies strive for “diversity,” but only as it relates to the employees' appearance, race, religion or sexual orientation. Instead, look for diversity in creative skills. One interesting way is to have the HR department only hire high school dropouts for a month. They'll be forced to consider different characteristics that make the candidates great. How much can you remember from what you studied in high school or university? If you're like most people, not much. In fact, a study in 2008 showed that university graduates forget most of what they learn for their majors within two years. So don't judge candidates too much by their formal education – dig a little deeper. Examining a person's passions and interests gives you a much better understanding of his or her creative potential. Hobbies – particularly complex and time-consuming ones – can be particularly revealing. For example, the man who developed the joystick for Atari was initially hired because he impressed the author with his passion for model trains. Creative people are enthusiastic about reading, so interviewers should ask candidates about their favorite books. The fact that someone reads at all is more important than the type of books they read. Effective interviews also include strange or complex questions. This gives interviewers an insight into the thought-process of the person they're talking to. The answer itself isn't the most important part – it's how the person thinks. The authors like to ask interviewees to estimate the number of chewing gum pieces under the table, for instance. This lets them demonstrate their ability to tackle unusual problems. Also, don't be satisfied with the person's first response when asking questions – keep digging. People often use the word “we” when describing successes in their previous workplaces, for instance. Don't just accept that: figure out exactly what they contributed to the project they're speaking of. Were they a leader? Did they play a big or small role? In his younger days, Steve Wozniak loved pranks. He once rewired the phone numbers of hotel and taxi services at airports with those of his friends. Imagine their surprise at receiving calls asking for rooms and taxis! Good pranks like Wozniak’s play a significant role in a team. Pranks lighten up the atmosphere and help people take themselves a bit less seriously. That's very important, because when people feel more relaxed, they'll feel more comfortable taking risks. That's vital for creativity. There are many ways to create this kind of atmosphere. One good way is to have parties. Parties are great for fostering creativity. Remember that innovation doesn't always come from the top – it can come from the chairman of the board or the janitor. At parties, people freely exchange their ideas, which can lead to great things. Once at a party at Atari, for example, the employees began thinking about how fun it would be to compete against each other at something. This led them to develop Indy 8, the eight-person racing simulator. Indy 8 was once rumored to be making one million dollars per year. Parties also relieve tensions in the workplace. If your employees are anxious or stressed out, they won't be able to come up with great ideas. So be sure to give them enough holidays. Better yet, give them days off spontaneously every once in a while. Only tell them a few days in advance – they'll be more excited if it's a surprise. You also need to promote fairness in the company. This is crucial for any kind of creative environment. The author always tries to give Atari employees as much credit for their ideas as possible, for instance. Giving credit where it’s due makes employees feel validated and encourages them to keep contributing in the future. They'll like contributing to projects more if they know their hard work will be recognized. Have you ever had a manager that supervised employees like they were children? How did it feel? That sort of management style never works, and it also destroys the employees' creativity. Managers need to treat those under them like adults, and help them realize their ideas. They need to remove obstacles to creativity, not create them. One effective way managers can reduce obstacles is by telling everyone about future projects well in advance. Creative people are always thinking about a variety of problems at the same time, often subconsciously. If they have ample time to consider a new project, they'll already have great ideas for it by the time it starts. The author told his team six months in advance before they had to start adapting their games for the European market, for instance. When the starting time came, they'd already studied European market standards and thought of some strategies for it entering it. It's also necessary to have managers themselves contribute to the creative process. They need to do more than simply veto ideas. Managers who just reject their employees' ideas all the time are not helpful. The author had a policy at Atari that managers weren't allowed to say no to any ideas. Instead, they had to offer suggestions on how to improve them, or find the idea's positive qualities. The managers were nervous at first to adopt this policy, but it ultimately forced them to be more imaginative. If managers have any objections to anything, have them write their thoughts down and take personal responsibility for them. The objections will be more thoughtful and precise, so they'll also be more constructive. When was the last time you took a risk? Did you feel frightened? Most people avoid risks, because they're too wary of the possible outcomes. People feel the same way at work. This doesn't make sense at all, because risk-taking is the only way a company can succeed – or even survive. Luckily, you can inspire a productive culture of risk-taking without ruining the company if you do it the right way. Risks are absolutely necessary if you want success. James Dyson, the founder of Dyson, took a huge risk when he went four million dollars in debt while creating his innovative vacuum cleaner. It paid off: today, his company is worth two billion dollars. Companies also need to celebrate their failures, so people won't be afraid of taking risks. At Chuck E. Cheese, a restaurant chain founded by the author, regional managers received an unusual award for the biggest screw-up of the previous quarter: a tin turkey. When you can laugh at a failure, it'll be less painful. Failures are also great learning opportunities. The first Apple computer, Lisa, was a failure. It was slow, expensive and didn't sell. Apple learned from the failure, then went on to create the improved model, Mac. It was a big hit. There are ways to make sure risks don't threaten the company's existence. Try to take lots of small risks, instead of a few big ones. Assess your risks to figure out how much you stand to lose. Bushnell learned this lesson in 1984, when he put all his money into developing a robot that served as a pet and helper. The project failed because of technical difficulties, and he suffered an almost complete loss. Since then, he has never risked more than 10 percent of his budget on new ideas. So if something fails, don't give up – let the experience teach you how to work better next time. Have you ever felt like you ran out of ideas or imagination? Most people have. Luckily, there are strategies you can use to jump start creativity. Companies and individuals alike can implement them in the workplace. When you run out of creative steam, change something in your daily life. Mixing things up activates your mind, which can pave the way for new ideas. When Frank Zappa felt short on ideas, he made himself wake up an hour earlier every day. After twelve days, he was waking up at eight in the evening. He said this shift in his schedule was enough to get his imagination working again. Sometimes a change of scenery can do the trick. Bushnell got his idea for the first automotive navigation system while on a boat in the Pacific, for instance. You can also kick-start creativity by trying something new. Why not roll a dice to decide what you're going to do next? Sometimes that can lead you to try great things you otherwise wouldn't. Bushnell once wrote a list of things he could potentially do, and rolled a dice to pick one. His list included very unusual activities, like climbing Mount Kilimanjaro and going skydiving. He rolled “write a book,” so he did. Finally, when you're coming up with new product ideas, don't worry if they're expensive for consumers. Market the first versions to wealthy people. Rich people can pay any price, so initially design your products for them. Once the product is successful, you can bring the price down to something more people can afford. This happened when the bicycle was invented in Paris in the 1860s. It was expensive and mostly sold to nobles, and remained a luxury item until the early twentieth century. The bicycle had to go through this period before it could become the basic form of transportation we know today. The key message in this book: Creativity is the most important part of any business. If you want to succeed, go out and look for creative people, and don't be concerned if they seem strange on the surface. Create an environment where they feel free to express themselves and test their ideas. Make their workplace enjoyable. If you nurture talented people in the right way, the rewards are potentially life-changing, for both you and them. Actionable advice: Reward your employees' failures. Never punish someone for taking a risk – risks are the only way a company can succeed. Instead, encourage risk-taking, and if something doesn't work out, view it as a learning experience. If you reward people's failures, they'll feel more comfortable trying new ideas in the future. Laughing at a failure also makes it manageable.

At the end of the day, the performance of employees is the primary factor impacting the success of a business, and it is the manager’s job to ensure that performance hits its peak. Much has been written about how managers can fulfill their role effectively, but what if all the conventional wisdom about management is in fact wrong? Instead of taking for granted the age-old adages of management, First, Break All the Rules examines the practices used by truly great managers. These blinks explain on a practical level how managers can find the right employees for the right roles and keep them satisfied with their jobs. You’ll also find out how to walk the tightrope of allowing employees independence while ensuring the quality of their work through guidance and control. Finally, you’ll also find out how to deal with situations where an employee is not performing in line with expectations.     There are many ways to increase revenues for a company, yet most of these techniques result in only short-lived growth. In fact, a successful business – one which can sustain growth – can be based only on consistently good performance, which has much more to do with how things are managed within the business. In other words, at the heart of a successful business is a strong and high-performing workplace. The success of any business can be based only on a revenue stream that’s robust and sustainable. Such a stream is not generated by techniques like slashing prices or opening a new location, but is the result of a growing base of loyal customers. Growing such a loyal customer base requires that those customers feel satisfied with a company’s excellent products and services. So, how can a company create such a strong, high-performing workplace? The key lies in satisfied employees: the more satisfied an employee is, the more she’ll contribute to building and maintaining a strong workplace. Why is that? For one thing, satisfied employees are more engaged in their work, and because of their stronger commitment they greatly contribute to higher productivity. Another reason is that employees’ commitment often has an indirect effect on company profits. A satisfied, engaged employee is more likely to save energy (by, for example, making sure to turn off the lights) and negotiate prices, and less likely to steal from the company. Finally, such engaged employees will probably also stay longer with the company, and are more likely to be friendlier towards customers because they care greatly about how the company is perceived. So, in order to be successful in the long term, companies must build strong workplaces where performance is consistently high. Ensuring that employees are satisfied in their roles is a sure-fire way of creating such a workplace. If the key to a successful business is the satisfaction of its employees, then what’s the key to that satisfaction? The manager. This is because the manager is responsible for defining the employees’ work environment, creating an atmosphere that will lead to employees’ contentment. Indeed, an employee’s satisfaction is influenced far more by the role of her immediate manager than by the policies and procedures of the company as a whole, and this is because managers transform the work ethos of the company into practices and guidelines. For instance, in terms of practices, this transformation often involves translating new company strategies into concrete goals employees can focus on. For example, large technology companies no longer focus on producing innovative products, but instead aim to make their product the standard. When turning this new strategy into a concrete guideline, the sales manager must, for instance, make sure his sales clerks tell customers about the product’s compatibility with other gadgets. And in terms of guidelines, the benefits of a manager who knows, trusts and invests in her employees outweighs, for those workers, any employee-unfriendly company regulations. For example, consider the manager of a large media company that didn’t give pay raises to designers unless they were promoted to management level. The main problem here was that the designers who performed excellently received no reward for doing so. To resolve the issue and reward these high-performing workers, the manager invented a new job position in which designers could continue designing but were also responsible for sharing their insights with new designers – thus making the job appear like a management role. As these examples show, managers are in charge of transforming the workplace into more than just a place to make a living. And although no one should be willing to work at company which pays poorly, what’s more valuable to employees is a workplace that offers a sense of purpose and the potential for self-expression. To become a great manager you must first let go of popular management principles and learn what the essence of your job really is. The first thing to understand is that a manager is not a leader. While great managers and great leaders have much in common, a crucial difference between them lies in their focus: Whereas leaders look outward, towards the future, great managers mostly look inward, at what already exists and can be turned into performance. Whereas leaders must be visionary, great managers must be empathetic. In short, managers deal with people, and they’re job is to find, focus and keep good employees. However, if managers aren’t leaders then what exactly are they? Managers are mediators. They attend to the needs of both the company and the employee, and address the interests of both. They ensure the workplace atmosphere is conducive not only to hitting the desired economic targets, but also to making each team member feel productive and essential. In negotiating both sides, managers try to find a point of convergence – the point at which business demands and employees are brought together productively. In this sense, managers can be seen as “catalysts.” Like a catalyst in chemistry, the manager facilitates a reaction between two discrete elements, which (although involving just the two parties) nevertheless requires an additional something to get the process started. As you can see, the key to a successful business lies in successful mediation, bringing the needs of the employee and the needs of the company into alignment. In this regard, managers play the central role, by finding, focusing and keeping good employees. In the next blinks, you’ll find out how great managers get the most out of their employees – by identifying and nurturing their unique talents. Although all great managers have their own individual styles of management, there is one central maxim they all share: Every person is unique. They have a unique way of thinking and relating to the world, and are motivated in ways specific to them. In fact, studies show that during the first 15 years of a person’s life, the brain’s synaptic connections are carved in a highly individual way, and that after that age people are not capable of changing much mentally. Furthermore, everyone’s unique nature includes talents and “non-talents.” Talents should not be considered special abilities possessed only by gifted people. For instance, the word “talent” should not be used to describe Mozart or Einstein. A talent, rather, means every recurring pattern of thought, feeling or behavior that can be productively applied. For example, some people are naturally outgoing, and would therefore make perfect sales reps. But people also have “non-talents” – the lack of such a recurring pattern. Some people are unbelievably messy, yet not being able to keep a clean desk doesn’t mean that such people won’t meet their deadlines. There are three types of talents: striving, thinking and relating. Striving talents define a person’s motivation – such as competitiveness. Such people are motivated by the goal of being better than others. Thinking talents define how someone approaches any mental work. Some have the talent of being focused, while others are able to leave options open. Finally, relating talents define communication habits: some people have the talent of confronting people, others of avoiding confrontation. In a work environment, the first kind of person might cause friction, whereas the latter will contribute to a pleasant working atmosphere. For instance, she might be the kind of person who brings homemade cake to the office. Contrary to popular belief, people cannot become everything they want to be. However, each person has a distinct set of talents – a fact all great managers know and make the most of. The fact that each person has his or her unique and unchangeable set of behaviors means that, for managers, this must be translated into management guidelines. This is because each employee’s unique nature plays a crucial role in their individual job performance. For example, although accumulated experience can contribute to a performance increase, it’s actually the employee’s unique talents that determine how well they perform. Performing at maximum level at a job is possible only in cases where talent and job demands are well-matched. Consider a common task of nurses: giving injections. The more injections a nurse performs, the better he gets at them. However, if a nurse lacks the required empathetic talent, he will never be able to relate to his patients the way that care workers are required to do. Thus his non-talent has become a weakness, and he will never succeed as a nurse. How, then, can managers best deal with the situation where every employee is naturally talented in unique and different ways? They should capitalize on them. Successful management is all about focusing on people’s natural set of talents, then making use of them. Managers must establish techniques which allow their employees to use and develop their innate and unique talents, rather than neglecting such uniqueness and trying to force-fit employees into a certain mold. But not only do great managers capitalize on their employees’ uniquely different talents, they also redress the fact that employees have non-talents by preventing them from developing into weaknesses. In order for managers to put employees’ natural talents to use, they can following these four general guidelines: Select for talent Define the right outcomes Focus on strength Find the right fit The insight that everyone has his or her unique, natural talents is shared by all great managers. In the next blinks, we’ll see how certain techniques for successful management can be deduced from this insight, including how to select the right person for the job. As we have seen, the snug fit of an employee’s talents with company demands contributes greatly to good performance. But how do great managers find such employees? And how do they decide which qualities they’re looking for? First, by being aware of the different kinds of talent a job position requires. For each position, they should consider at least one critical talent in each of the talent categories (striving, thinking and relating). In order to determine the appropriate talent for the job, great managers consider not only the job title and description, but also the culture and ethos of the company, and the team which the new employee will join. For example, in any given team, distinct roles are required. A team consisting of people who tend to avoid confrontation might benefit from an employee with the relating talent of bringing issues to the surface. Second, great managers conduct job interviews in a way that allows the candidate to reveal their personality. To this end, they don’t put candidates under stress, base their evaluations only on appearance, or judge candidates hastily. Great managers know that people need time to adjust to the often-awkward interview setting, and that if they put people under stress, they’ll end up evaluating whether the talent can perform under stress. Of course, such a talent might be crucial for some job positions, but certainly not for all of them. Furthermore, by focusing only on this quality, the manager can blind herself towards a candidate’s other, potentially well-fitting talents. Another interview technique great managers use is to ask open-ended questions – those which prompt the interviewee to answer in a personal way. And when considering the candidate’s answers, great managers look for specificity and “top-of-mind” responses, as these guarantee the answers are more personal. In sum, managers must find a way to ensure that, whatever work needs to be done, it should be done by employees with the talent most suited to succeeding in that task. Gathering a team of talented employees is not enough.Managers must also make sure that employees’ talents are actually put to use properly. What often gets in the way of achieving this is the conventional career path – a model of progress with many flaws. What are those flaws? First, just because an employee excels at a certain job doesn’t mean that they’ll excel in a higher position. One rung in the career ladder does not necessarily lead to another. Second, the conventional path limits prestige to those who manage to climb the ladder, thus generating conflict as co-workers compete for the limited, higher positions. Finally, this system overemphasizes the value of experience, leading to a “hunt for marketable skills and experiences”; if an employee has managed to climb a rung of the ladder, this is interpreted as a gain in marketable skills. Great managers have little use for the conventional career path. Instead, they use a range of techniques to establish alternative paths that better suit the employee. In doing this, great managers create an environment where money and prestige are spread equally throughout the company, and, because of that, the employee is much freer to base her career choices on her talents. One of these techniques is to define graded levels of achievement. This technique is practiced in many law firms, where promotion makes a significant difference to prestige and salary but not to the work itself. Another technique is broadbanding the pay structure: the pay for each position is structured so that the top-end of a lower-level position overlaps the bottom-end of the position above. In this way, excellent performance in a lower-level position becomes more lucrative than poor performance at a higher-level position. Great managers know that the conventional career path is full of wrongheaded assumptions, so they try to make it possible for their employees to climb up the career ladder while always doing the work that best suits their talents.  Ultimately, the results of management lie in the employees’ performance. For this reason, great managers shift their attention away from controlling employees and onto employees’ performance results and outcomes. Behind this is the manager’s awareness that they have only limited control over workers. For a start, managers are not the ones who actually do the work that may lead to the results they desire. All they can do is motivate their employees to do it. Thus the manager’s control should be reconceptualized as a mediated form of control – or, “remote control.” Yet despite their lack of direct control over the work determining performance results, managers nevertheless remain accountable for such results. Therefore, they must focus on the desired outcomes the work is intended to produce. Great managers define these desired outcomes for employees and allow them to find their own ways of reaching them. Often, there is no one right way to accomplish such goals. So rather than establish rules that require, for example, sales clerks to follow a certain selling style, the manager should only define the outcomes she wants to see. This allows her sales staff to choose the selling style they’re most comfortable with. There are many advantages to this approach. One is that it’s efficient, because the manager does not waste time by devising and trying to enforce a style of working. Another advantage is that it encourages employees to take responsibility, and thus attracts responsible employees. By defining the outcome, great managers create a work environment where employees feel motivated to achieve, to move towards a definite goal without being told how to get there. Finally, such a work environment actually helps employees to become aware of their talents, as they are put to the test. Great managers know that they don’t need to establish a strict, clear method for achieving a desired result. The most important thing is that, in the end, the desired outcome is reached. While great managers allow employees to be individuals, that doesn’t mean employees are free to do whatever they wish. Indeed, in terms of certain aspects, there are some rules employees must adhere to. First, any rules concerning accuracy and safety must be followed. For example, banks have defined regulatory steps and strict internal guidelines to ensure money is handled securely and precisely. Second, any rules essential to industry or company standard must be adhered to, as this ensures the legitimacy of the company and its comparability to other companies on the market. For example, accountants must know and apply the rules of double-entry bookkeeping, and engineers must ensure the product will operate on the standard electrical frequency. Such rules represent the minimum standard for meeting and satisfying customer expectations, which revolve around accuracy, availability, partnership and advice. The most basic factors here are accuracy and availability: they meet the minimum requirement for customer satisfaction. For example, it’s obvious that if a customer wants her car wheels changed, the workshop must have wheels in stock and a mechanic who’ll do the job correctly. The rules that great managers insist their employees obey all relate to those two basic factors. But to achieve maximum customer satisfaction, much still lies in the hands of the employee. For example, the customer wanting her wheels exchanged might become a maximally satisfied customer if the mechanic exceeds the customer’s expectations by offering advice on how to make wheels last longer, or simply involves the waiting customer in a nice conversation. Furthermore, if the motor mechanic has the additional talent of being outgoing, they might even transform the customer’s waiting time into a pleasant experience. Following these basic guidelines ensures the minimum performance results, and the baseline for customer satisfaction. As for the rest, employees must be allowed to follow their talents. Great managers establish successful, personal relationships with employees, and they do this in order to help those employees to develop. They also spend a lot of time with their best employees, trying to understand not only their talents, but all aspects of their lives. It’s only by knowing their employees this well that great managers are able to choose the right ways to develop them. For instance, it’s only by knowing what’s important to employees that the manager is able to motivate or reward them appropriately. What’s more awkward that rewarding a worker with a gift she doesn’t like? If an excellent though naturally shy employee is rewarded with a very public display of appreciation, this will at best make her uncomfortable, and at worst, misunderstood. When it comes to finding out how to improve employees’ performance, great managers refer to excellent employees, not past mistakes or average employees. Why? Firstly, learning from mistakes can lead to wrong assumptions. Say you’re observing nurses with emotional relationships to their patients, but you notice also that they become so overwhelmed they can’t do their job. You might conclude that forming emotional relationships is a bad thing. But you’d be wrong. The truth is that forming strong emotional relationships with patients is a key talent which excellent nurses possess. The problem is that you observed only bad nurses, and with those nurses this talent for emotional connection can develop in the wrong way. Secondly, establishing business goals based on average employee performance will lead you to underestimate what’s possible. It’s only by learning from excellent employees that the criteria for excellence can be discovered: Excellent nurses show that an appropriate relationship with patients is needed for care work, and excellent workers likewise show that performance can be improved continually. As we can see, high-performing employees are worth learning from and about. By doing so, these employees can be helped to perform better, and they can also help managers to understand how they achieve excellence. Because great managers focus on performance, they immediately address any performance that’s not meeting their expectations. Rather than drawing hasty conclusions about poor performance, great managers first analyze the situation. For instance, they will try to determine whether poor performance is caused by lack of teachable skills or knowledge. If so, the right training will likely improve performance. But they also question their own work, wondering whether it was an error in management that led to a poorly performing employee. Yet, what if instead of being caused by lack of skills, or by bad management, poor performance is caused by an employee’s non-talent? Since no one’s perfect, nor has all the requisite talents to excel in a certain position, this might not be a particularly unusual situation. So what do great managers do in those cases? They try to “manage around” the non-talent. They do this by, for example, building up a support system to alleviate the employee’s weakness or make it irrelevant (e.g. a spell check software for a bad speller). Or they find the employee a complementary partner, forming a team in which each member’s specific non-talent is supported by the talent of the other. However, in those cases where a non-talent proves to be a real weakness, great managers do not hesitate to let go of the employee. Where a particular talent is an essential requirement for a job position, an employee who does not naturally possess this talent is better off leaving the position. Of course, this doesn’t mean the employee is a generally useless person. It simply means that their talents can be applied more productively elsewhere. Great managers do not feel bad about being tough because they do not blame the employee. In fact, if they blame anyone, it’s themselves, because they made a casting mistake. The key message in this book: Each person has a unique set of talents which make him or her the right fit for a certain job. Successful management encourages and helps employees to develop these innate talents and to become even better at what – thanks to their natural inclinations – they’re already good at.  Actionable advice from the book: Select for talent When recruiting, one of the most important things to remember is to “select for talent.” The unique talents of candidates and the job they’re applying for must make a good fit. So, during the job interview, ask open-ended questions and listen to specifics to discover the candidate’s talents.  ","headers":["What’s in it for me?","Employee satisfaction is the key to a successful business.","The manager determines the degree of employee satisfaction.","The work of the manager is centered on mediating, not leading.","Each person has a unique and unchanging set of behaviors which can be considered talents.","To create a high-performing workplace, managers must consider each employee’s unique talents.","Great managers find people who have the right talent for the job.","Great managers establish alternative career paths for employees, thereby keeping them in the best-fitting job position.","Great managers focus on reaching desired outcomes, not on controlling their employees.","Great managers establish basic rules that ensure a baseline of customer satisfaction.","Great managers focus on excellent employees, who they try to develop and learn from.","Great managers carefully analyze poor performance and try to work around employees' non-talents.","Final Summary"],"category":"Leadership","image_url":"https://images.blinkist.com/images/books/530466a53439370008160000/3_4/470.jpg","synopsis":"First, Break all the Rules (1999) shows how great management differs from conventional approaches.

This introductory observation might seem obvious enough, but it bears repeating – for, despite probably knowing better, many business leaders put their organizations on risky cost “crash diets” when the going gets tough, essentially starving all departments of resources as soon as a crisis hits. So how can you cut costs in a way that still allows your business to grow? While most business books tell you to focus on innovation or creativity, they usually forget to mention the backbone of growth: smart cost cutting and effective organizational restructuring. These blinks will help you decide which areas of your business to make cuts in, where to restructure and what to reinvest in so that your organization can truly be fit for growth. In these blinks, you’ll find out what differentiating capabilities are; how to pitch an organizational restructuring to your stakeholders; and what middle managers can do to minimize employee anxiety. What’s stopping your company from growing? Perhaps it’s your customers’ rising expectations – or maybe you’re struggling with industry-wide economic problems? Fortunately, whatever your difficulties, the solution is the same – you need to cut your costs. No matter what industry your company is in, you must focus as much on cutting costs as on growing revenue. But where should you start cutting? Actually, the more relevant question is, where shouldn’t you? In order to answer this, you first need to pinpoint your company’s differentiating capabilities – the processes, tools or knowledge that makes your company better than its competitors. In other words, what are the things your company does best? Understanding what your differentiating capabilities are is crucial because these are the areas of your business that you don’t want to cut. And once you’ve identified them, you should start devoting the lion’s share of your financial resources to them. In practice, this means cutting costs in all other areas of your company so that you can focus on your priorities. Sound like a risky strategy? Well, it’s less risky than attempting to pursue excellence in all your business functions. Many companies believe that every department, from Human Resources to Logistics, needs to be “best in class.” They then allocate generous amounts of resources to each department accordingly. However, these spend-happy companies rarely ask themselves whether financing each department is actually conducive to overall success. Outshining the competition in every aspect isn’t really necessary, and trying to do so often forces companies to underinvest in the activities unique to their enterprise. This is a mistake that the most successful companies avoid. For example, Swedish home-furniture company IKEA focuses only on being the best at what it’s already the best at. IKEA knows that it’s beloved for its elegantly simple product design, inviting stores and low prices. Consequently, the company relentlessly searches for opportunities to save costs in all other areas – such as their supply chain and product packaging – as long as the cuts don’t affect product quality, in-store customer experience and low prices. Once you’ve identified your company’s key strengths – those things you do better than your competitors – you may still feel reluctant to start cutting costs in other areas. After all, if your organization is doing well right now, there’s no need to change, right? Unfortunately, this is a dangerous way of thinking. The best time to make your company fit for growth is before a crisis hits, not after. Waiting to tackle an ineffective cost structure until you hit hard times is a recipe for disaster. That’s because, in times of crisis, you’re more likely to take drastic measures and cut the wrong things. At such times, companies tend to either make budget cuts across the entire organization or focus on cutting high-cost departments, simply because these areas are the most conspicuous. Both of these scenarios are ill-advised because there’s a good chance that those all-important differentiating capabilities will take a hit in the process. Therefore, in order to set your business up for long-term success, don’t wait for a crisis to hit. Just as we can’t achieve physical fitness through dieting exclusively, companies cannot hope to see long-term results if their only plan is to take extreme measures during crises. Just as people must regularly use their bodies, businesses must regularly flex their cost-saving muscles to stay fit. One of the best ways to keep your company in shape is to make sure its organizational model promotes strategic cost cutting. An organizational model indicates how the company’s command structure is arranged, as well as the relationships between different people and departments. So, to cut costs, a company could, for example, redesign its organizational model so that each manager manages more people. This reduces the overall number of managers needed, which is a sustainable cost-cutting measure. Additionally, reducing manager numbers may also reduce the layers of hierarchy in your company. This is a benefit, because each layer of command, as you may already know, tends to increase the time needed to confirm and implement decisions. This time adds up and can eat away at your competitive advantage. Some CEOs are hugely effective at cutting their organizations’ costs, while others flounder and fail to make the necessary changes. You may think that these unsuccessful leaders were constrained by circumstances beyond their control, but this is rarely the case. By following certain leadership principles, cost-cutting programs are far more likely to be successful. One of the most important principles is that CEOs should act as passionate advocates for change within their company. If they don’t, no change is likely to come about. CEOs can begin spreading their cost-cutting message by giving a presentation to their senior-executive team. This presentation should include a candid assessment of the economic environment in which the company operates and emphasize the organization’s vulnerable position within this business climate. Then, it should articulate what the company’s customers need and present an accurate depiction of its competitors. Finally, the CEO should offer a compelling vision for the future, a vision that may be realized if cost-cutting measures are successfully implemented. All too often, CEOs shy away from having this type of frank discussion with their senior-executive team. Why? Because they haven’t yet worked out every detail of the change program, and thus lack the confidence to bring it to the table. But not having a plan for all contingencies is nothing to worry about. In fact, having a detailed roadmap right from the outset can be counterproductive. If everything is already fleshed out, there’s little room for anyone other than the CEO to contribute ideas to the project, meaning that promising additional ideas may be missed. Additionally, employees will feel more committed to the project if they’ve helped craft it, and they’re likely to take greater ownership of it within their realm of expertise. So encourage teams to speak openly, without censoring themselves, when they present ideas to team leaders and executives. What springs to mind if someone mentions “outsourcing”? If you think of Indian call-center agents who are paid a pittance relative to their Western counterparts, you’re not alone. However, that’s not the full story. Many people confuse outsourcing with offshoring. The latter refers to moving one’s business (or part of that business) to another country, but outsourcing simply means paying an external provider to undertake some of your organization’s activities. Therefore, an external provider in an outsourcing context could be based overseas, but they could also be next door to your company. Outsourcing work brings numerous cost-cutting benefits. For instance, over the course of a five-year outsourcing contract, using external service providers can reduce sales and marketing costs by about a third. You can also save by outsourcing some of your IT department, such as your help desk. Significantly, the biggest savings often come from outsourcing certain back-office activities, such as your employee payroll department, which could cut the cost of your back-office by up to 50 percent! The reason for these savings is that the external provider specializes in performing the service it offers, meaning it probably has more efficient processes and can leverage economies of scale. Although outsourcing particular business activities to an external provider is an effective cost-cutting technique for most, the way in which you go about it depends on the size of your company. Bigger companies benefit from outsourcing because it allows them to maximize their efficiency. By outsourcing high-volume business activities, such as travel processing or order entry, larger organizations can make incremental savings. Smaller businesses, in contrast, may not have enough transaction volume to make outsourcing such activities worthwhile. However, they can benefit from outsourcing activities such as research and development, data analytics and product design. By taking advantage of external providers’ specialization in these areas, smaller companies can benefit from the sort of expertise that they probably wouldn’t be able to establish in-house. In this way, outsourcing can still promote growth. How would you define your company’s footprint? The authors believe it includes every location where your organization has a presence – from your research and development centers to your service points. By optimizing your footprint, you can cut costs by 15 or 20 percent over just two years. So how does this optimization work? The first step is to analyze how cost-effective your company’s locations are. The next step is to improve that cost-effectiveness, by moving away from the most ineffective locations. Although moving some of your company’s locations purely for the sake of cutting costs might seem like a lot of work, there are certain circumstances that make it a worthwhile, and prudent, move. For instance, many Western companies have already moved manufacturing work to low-cost countries (LCCs), such as the Philippines, which gives these businesses access to cheaper labor rates. But it’s important to note that in recent times, the cost of labor in LCCs has begun to change rapidly. So it’s entirely possible that you moved your company’s manufacturing operations to an LCC several years ago, but, because of changes in the region’s wage rate, you’re now considering relocating to a new location where local wages are rising more slowly. Whatever the driver for the relocation, be sure to always consider infrastructure and local talent in your plan. For example, you’ll need skilled staff to work in your customer-service call centers, research-and-development labs and manufacturing factories. Therefore, when deciding where to relocate these departments, examine the characteristics of the local workforce first. Do they have the qualifications you need? Additionally, consider the regional infrastructure of the area you’re considering relocating to. You’ll need access to good road networks, port facilities or airports, to transport your physical goods to customers. Lastly, if you’re relocating back-office activities such as finance or IT, ensure you choose somewhere with high-speed internet, as well as reliable electricity. After all, you won’t save money if your back-office teams can’t work due to infrastructure problems! When cutting costs, it’s up to a company’s CEO and executive-leadership team to restructure their organization. This is no minor challenge. However, the executive-leadership team won’t be the only ones feeling the strain. It's important to remember that those tasked with actually running the company through this transition will also grapple with their own difficulties. Middle managers are responsible for the daily running of an organization. Consequently, they face unique challenges and opportunities during the restructuring process. For instance, the executive-leadership team may share very little information with middle managers about the “whys,” “whats” and “hows” of the restructuring process. Despite this lack of knowledge, middle managers are expected to guide and support anxious subordinates, many of whom will be worried about losing their jobs, during the restructuring process. In spite of these challenges, the restructuring process also presents opportunities for mid-level managers. For example, they may learn new management skills, or they might be able to rid their team of under-performing employees. Given this mixed bag of both challenge and opportunity, the best thing for middle managers to do during this period of uncertainty is to try to keep their subordinates focused on their day-to-day work. They can do this by reinforcing the organization’s expectations and values. For instance, managers could introduce new performance metrics for their subordinates. Customer satisfaction surveys, for example, could be implemented within customer-service teams. The results of the surveys can then be shared with the customer-service agents. Initiatives like this will encourage employees to take renewed pride in their work, stay focused and keep delivering to the best of their abilities. The key message in these blinks: In their quest for long-term success, most leaders focus on growing their company’s revenues. However, when it comes to sustainable growth, you should focus on cutting costs in many areas of your organization, while only reinvesting in those areas that represent your businesses’ unique strengths. Cost cutting is a stressful undertaking, but it is also the best way to secure your company’s future prosperity.  Actionable advice: What exactly should you outsource? So you’ve decided to outsource some of your company’s work to external service providers. Good decision! But which organizational activities should you move? Focus on offloading standardized processes that are well-documented with clearly defined inputs and measurable outputs. And, though it’s tempting, try not to outsource highly complex processes, such as those requiring judgment calls by experienced front-line workers. Got feedback?

The people who answer this distress signal are the superheroes of business strategy, the consultants. Yet as important as consulting is to the business world, few know exactly what sort of role a consultant really plays in a struggling organization. For many managers, a consultant is hailed as an expert troubleshooter, providing helpful answers to a company’s myriad problems. Yet no matter how much a manager wants a consultant to provide that quick fix, a consultant can only advise and teach – not take over. These blinks show you the strengths and limitations of consulting work and exactly how top consultants go about doing good work every day. In these blinks, you’ll discover why every consultant must practice what they preach; why consultants seem to spend most of their time chatting; and why the meeting is a consultant’s greatest weapon. Many believe that being rational is the key to making effective decisions. So managers often try to suppress their more impulsive, emotional sides and focus on being logical. But really, this isn’t always the best approach. If you’re a consultant, being cold and rational will only take you so far. Consultation happens on two levels: the technical, business level and the interpersonal level. And even amid the most technical, complicated systems, we can’t forget that every employee is a human, too! The bottom line is that a consultant can’t truly grasp the problem if she doesn’t understand the emotional and interpersonal dynamics of the situation at hand. Consider a hospital where many different types of doctors and specialists see a single patient. An internist may draw blood; a nurse administers medicine; and so on. Although database software could streamline and help organize this multilevel process, this would only happen if everyone involved in the process used the software properly. Thus as a consultant, you have to realize that introducing a new efficiency tool isn’t just a question of adequate terminals or software proficiency. Each doctor or specialist will need to adjust how they work on a personal level, too. If you ignore this variable, the introduction of new technology is all but useless! And while interpersonal dynamics are important, as a consultant, don’t ignore your own feelings. Pay attention to your first response to a situation; it might shed light on a deeper issue, as well as effectively highlighting a potential solution. So if you get the sense that management is too hard on employees, it’s a sure bet that the employees feel this, too. Armed with this bit of intuition, a consultant can then discover ways to improve communication between staff and management, ultimately building a better team. To sum up, don’t ignore your feelings and instincts. Instead, use them as data to better understand the situation in front of you! Let’s imagine a consultant – a confident individual in a sharp suit, strutting around your office taking notes. Although this person might look important, in reality, he has very little direct power. A consultant can do two things: advise people and try to motivate them to implement new ideas. So if you are a consultant, how can you be as effective as possible? First, people won’t listen to you at all if you come off like a hypocrite. Openness and honesty are the key characteristics a consultant needs to have. In short, you have to practice what you preach. Let’s say you’re a line manager in a traditional company with rigid hierarchies. A consultant tells you that a flat hierarchy would be more effective, as employees are more productive when they have input. You argue that the pressure of the job requires that everyone do as they’re told; having every decision open for discussion would just gum up the works and be counter-productive. Now what would you think if your flat-hierarchy consultant responded with, “Do as you’re told. I’m getting a lot of money from your CEO and he wants things done my way!” Obviously, you’d be horrified. And what’s more, you probably wouldn’t want to hear another word from this bossy, unenlightened individual. This situation gets at a crucial point. Behaving badly isn’t merely socially unacceptable, it’s also unproductive. Since people often learn by imitation, if you want someone to follow your advice, you have to walk the walk, too. This way, people will not only learn from what you say but also from what you do. What if that bossy consultant had instead responded by saying that he understood your concerns, and had already integrated them in his concept? You might not only be receptive to his ideas but also pick up some vital skills about how to better communicate with employees. So your company has a huge problem that you as a manager can’t solve. The light bulb goes on: I can call a consultant and let him figure it out! Maybe you could even go on vacation while the consultant goes to work. A dream scenario, sure, but the reality is different. Consultants and managers are both needed; a consultant comes up with a good solution, but a manager is the one who actually puts the solution into action. This is an important distinction. Although a consultant might act as a surrogate manager and solve a problem quickly, no one would learn anything from the process. If the problem returned, the company would need to again hire the consultant, having not learned the first time around! Thus a manager is a very important part of the consulting process. However, a consultant must be an independent agent with the latitude to objectively analyze the situation. But in some cases, the client is positive that he already understands the problem and he just wants the consultant to solve it. This is problematic, as most managers don’t have the analytical skills to correctly diagnose a problem. Consultants, on the other hand, are trained to do this. Here’s one example. Company A hired a consultant to solve the problem of trainees quitting the moment their training period ended. The company thought that high housing prices in the area were forcing potential employees to reconsider, and was considering boosting salaries or even building an affordable apartment complex just for employees. But the skilled consultant saw the situation differently. She realized that trainees were quitting because they disliked the stilted, hierarchic company culture. The trainees didn’t feel appreciated by management, and didn’t develop any kind of emotional attachment to the company. Once the consultant had arrived at this deeper understanding of the problem, she could advise Company A on better (and certainly cheaper) solutions. Each consulting opportunity is built on a series of stages, from setting expectations at the beginning of a job to collecting feedback once a successful solution has been implemented. The first stage is the contracting phase. Here is where a consultant and her clients establish the scope and general expectations of a project. This is an important step, as managers often are concerned that a consultant will exert too much control over the company. During this first stage, both parties should clearly discuss mutual expectations. This will help the consultant understand the project’s boundaries and will also soothe any client fears about how exactly the consultant will work and what sort of role she will have in the company. The next stage is discovery and data collection. Here you conduct a thorough, time-intensive analysis of the business (even if the problem seems superficial at first glance). What happens exactly during this phase will differ from job to job. Sometimes you’ll investigate balance sheets, while other times you’ll look at management-employee communication. How the company uses its software might be an issue; or, of course, you might look into all of these factors at once. The final stage happens when you’ve gathered your data and come up with a solution. During this stage, you’ll need to schedule feedback sessions to alleviate doubt and plan next steps. This stage is also a great opportunity to get employees on board, convincing them that your proposed solution will be beneficial for all. When computers were first introduced, for example, many companies treated the new technology simply as an expensive typewriter. At the time, a consultant’s role might have been to educate a company about computers, explaining the technology’s features and describing its revolutionary potential. So as you see, consulting isn’t just about finding a technical solution for a problem. It’s also about winning people’s confidence and getting them to commit to implementing your ideas. You know the saying: you can’t make an omelette without breaking a few eggs. Well, a consultant can’t change things at a company without upsetting a few people. People can be scared of change, but consulting is all about change! Resistance is only natural. Consider this scenario: you’ve been at the same job for 15 years. Then some young guy comes in, looks over your shoulder for about a week, and tells you that you’ve been doing your job incorrectly for the past 15 years. How would you feel? Resistance is a natural emotional response. And it comes in many guises. For instance, it can manifest itself as constant questioning. When a client starts to probe every little detail, you can be sure that they are resisting your ideas. So as a rule of thumb, if you are asked the same question twice, answer in good faith. If you are asked the same question a third time, however, take it as a clue that your client is resisting. Non-verbal cues can also be a sign of resistance. Pay attention to whether people are making eye contact with you. If they’re not, they might be feeling a bit of resistance to your work. Yet how can you deal with resistance if it’s unsubstantiated or counterproductive? Start by discussing it openly. Use neutral language and create an opening for the client to respond directly. Consider using phrases like, “I’m sensing that you doubt my judgment. Do you have the feeling that my research wasn’t thorough enough?” Asking a question forces the client to articulate their resistance, which leads to a discussion. Once the client’s feelings are out there, you have the opportunity to neutralize their resistance by explaining exactly how you arrived at your conclusions. Having the best ideas in the world doesn’t make a difference if you can’t communicate them to other people. And that’s especially true in the world of consulting. After all, even if a consultant develops a correct solution using sound logic, if she can’t convince people to implement her solution, the consultation is basically a failure. That’s because logic just can’t overcome emotions. We all know this intimately, as we all at one time or another have acted irrationally – like getting scared while watching a horror film. As a consultant, you’ll sometimes have to work your way through people’s emotions. Be sure you don’t ignore people’s feelings or rationalize them. Instead, talk about them all the time. Whenever you’re in a one-on-one meeting, in the cafeteria or carpooling to work, create space for people to be authentic and share their fears. This will build trust and allow your clients to realize that you have their best interests at heart. And in addition to private chats, talking about these matters in larger public meetings will also help support your work. Not the sort of meeting where one person drones on, but in a meeting where everyone is invited to take part. Have employees ask questions and air their views – they’ll feel heard and you’ll gain important data toward your eventual solution.   Let’s say you want to implement new software at a client’s company, yet the staff has doubts about the software’s level of complexity. How will you ever know this unless you hold a meeting and ask employees how they feel? And once people share their fears, you can reassure everyone by explaining the benefits of the software and describing a planned training program. Open communication is the key to effective consulting. So go ahead, start a conversation! Good consulting is like raising a child. You deal with a lot of problems in the beginning, but if you do things correctly, eventually you’ll have raised an adult that can resolve issues independently. But unlike a parent, a consultant only spends a bit of time with each company. And she needs to have as much of an impact as possible in that very short time frame. That’s why convincing everyone on the team – and especially staff – to support your vision is such a crucial part of the job. If you can’t do this, your legacy will be null. Consider this scenario. A certain company decided it needed a consultant, and a top manager called a friend who worked for a well-known consulting company. The duo brainstormed and came up with a lot of great, albeit complicated, ideas. But in their enthusiasm, they forgot to involve the company staff. And once the consultant left, employees had no idea how to follow all the new processes. So in the end, nothing changed. You have to convince employees to believe in your ideas, as it’s the only way your ideas can become reality! Ultimately, being a great consultant is about making yourself superfluous. Because once a new system runs smoothly and autonomously and is supported by managers and employees, there’s simply no need for a consultant. And the more a client learns from a consultant, the more problems the company can solve alone in the future. So in other words, consultants work to put themselves out of future jobs! Of course, teaching people how not to need you isn’t easy. But remember: new problems and new people are always just around the corner! The key message in this book: Consulting is about objectively analyzing a business and implementing lasting change. In the best cases, the consultant teaches a client to solve future problems independently through a deeper understanding of the company’s work and managerial roles.

However, being a large, ever-growing company won’t increase the odds of success – in fact, it often reduces them. In Focus, Al Ries explains how a company’s emphasis on growth can be its Achilles’ heel. The book will show you how “going global” with your company can be the death of it, and how keeping in step with technological changes is often essential to a company’s survival. Drawing from a wealth of examples, Ries presents the many common ways in which a company can develop its focus – for instance, by specializing – and in doing so increase its chances of succeeding in an increasingly crowded marketplace. Whether it’s a family-run bakery wanting to open a second location or a massive fast-food company aiming for total market domination, it seems that the one thing common to all businesses is their desire to grow. But have you ever questioned why companies are so fixated on growth? One reason is that growing will give them cost advantages. Certain company costs are fixed – they don’t change if the company increases its production – so the costs per unit decrease as the amount of units produced increases. For example, a bakery has variable costs for flour, yeast and other ingredients, and they vary according to the amount of bread it produces. It also has fixed costs, like the money it spent on its oven. Let’s say the oven cost $500 and the ingredients for one loaf of bread cost $1. If the bakery produces 100 loaves of bread, the fixed costs per loaf of bread are $500/100 = $5. So with the variable costs of $1, one loaf of bread would cost the bakery $6 if the total amount of loaves produced was 100. If the amount of loaves produced was 500, the costs for one loaf would sink to $2. Obviously, such cost advantages give companies a competitive edge. With lower costs, their products can be sold at more attractive prices, thus more customers are likely to buy them. Another reason that companies seek growth is that managers want to exploit the benefits that size brings (e.g., cost advantages). Naturally, managers want their company to make big profits, so it’s only logical they’d aim to increase revenues and decrease costs. This is why managers make growth the primary objective of companies. Take, for example, Wayne Calloway, who said during his time as CEO of PepsiCo that they’re fully committed to high (15 percent) long-term growth. To this end, PepsiCo focused on growth, and Calloway and his predecessors worked towards this goal by buying a number of companies.  It’s a popular belief that the larger the company, the more value it has. But is that really true? Sometimes, in fact, big companies with higher revenue have a lower value on the stock market than their smaller counterparts. For example, when you compare PepsiCo to Coca-Cola, PepsiCo is clearly the larger company. It recently made $28.5 billion in sales in one year, whereas in the same year Coca-Cola made only $16.2 billion. Yet Coca-Cola’s worth on the stock market was $93 billion and PepsiCo’s worth was only $44 billion. How is that possible? In a word, focus. Those large companies are handicapped by not having a clear focus. For instance, Coca-Cola focuses solely on beverages. PepsiCo, on the other hand, produces several beverage brands, including Pepsi, Mountain Dew and 7UP, owns a number of fast-food chains including Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and KFC and also the snack food company Frito-Lay. Furthermore, an unfocused company isn’t easily managed, which inevitably leads to performance issues and, ultimately, to less success. The notion that a professional manager can manage anything isn’t true. In addition to people skills and conceptual skills – applicable in any industry – management requires a deep knowledge of and experience in the specific field of the company. If a company operates in several fields, its management will run into problems, as the managers have insufficient expertise. PepsiCo, for example, has a hand in three different fields: beverages, snacks and fast-food restaurants. And, predictably, it also has an inherent management problem. The company tried to solve this problem by shuffling promising managers through every division. The manager that comes out of this process is supposed to have “well-rounded” experience in all fields, but actually has, usually, only one third of the experience of his counterpart at Coca-Cola. As we’ve seen, managers want to expand their companies so they can exploit the benefits of size. Luckily for them, there are several strategies to achieve exactly that. One of these strategies is line extension. This means that a company expands to sell a variety of other products while using an already established brand name. Virgin Atlantic, for example, is an airline company owned by Richard Branson’s Virgin Group. Since it was founded, the Virgin Group has put its brand name on several very different products, including Virgin Cola, Virgin Vodka and Virgin Financial Services. Another growth strategy is diversification: it aims at increasing the company’s sales volume by expanding into new markets or products that are not related to the company’s existing markets or products. For example, in the early 1980s, Xerox – a company known mainly for their photocopiers and printers – diversified into financial services. While such practices are very common, the problem with these strategies is that they cause companies to lose focus. For instance, when a company branches out into new markets, they will have to deal with an increased variety of products to manage, and they’ll also have an increased number of competitors to be aware of. For example, as a result of the Virgin Group using the line extension strategy, not only do they have British Airways and American Airlines as competition, but also Coca-Cola and Smirnoff. As this demonstrates, expanding a company can cause it to lose focus and this decreased focus can actually greatly damage a company. Nowadays it’s rare to find companies which operate only in one national market. Increasingly, most companies, big and small, follow the trend of globalization. This is not surprising, as it’s now easier than ever for companies to trade globally. One reason for this is that globalization dismantles trade barriers. Treaties such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) effectively eliminate high tariffs and other trade barriers that can make importing and exporting expensive for companies. For example, NAFTA is an agreement between the United States, Canada and Mexico that lifts tariffs on trade and enables companies to trade freely. However, there is a downside: trading on a global scale magnifies the forces that can unfocus a business. Companies that go global become unfocused by the possibilities that the world market offers. Even if the company is a focused business in their home market, as soon as they enter the global market they try to diversify and, in doing so, take on too many competitors at once. Very often those competitors are hard to outdo because they’re already established on the world market. Olivetti, for example, used to be a typewriter and (later) mainframe company in its home market. When they started to go global, they tried to match up with all the companies in the personal computer business and expanded into services, telecommunications and multimedia. The result? They haven’t had a profitable year since 1990. Just because a company is successful in its home market doesn’t guarantee that it will be successful in a global one. Some might even argue that those companies should have stayed at home. So by now you’ve learned about how companies become unfocused and how that’s bad for them. But is there a remedy? In other words, how do you refocus a company? When diversification and line extension unfocus a company, doing the exact opposite will focus it – and the opposite of extending your product range is reducing its size. Or, to put it another way, to refocus, a company should specialize in one product field. This is because a specialized company tends to attract more customers than a diversified one. Indeed, over the last decade department stores like Bloomingdale’s and Macy’s have been in and out of bankruptcy and perhaps the main reason for this is that they’ve lost many customers to speciality stores like Toys”R”Us. Department stores have a very wide product range running the gamut from food to clothing. On the other hand, speciality stores like Toys”R”Us usually have only one specialist product field, and this attracts more customers. It follows that companies that are trying to focus their company in order to be more successful should narrow that focus by specializing in one field only. Consider Toys”R”Us, for example. The famous toy store started out as Children’s Supermart, a children’s furniture store. Later, its founder, Charles Lazarus, added toys to the concept. The store, however, didn’t become hugely successful until Lazarus threw out the furniture and gave the store a clear and narrow focus: they would specialize in selling discount toys only. If you had a medical problem, like heart disease, would you go to a general practitioner or a cardiologist? Most people would chose the cardiologist of course, because medical specialists usually know more about their specialty than a general practitioner would. And the same thing happens in business: customers prefer to use specialized companies because they trust their products to have the best quality. This is because most people don’t have the knowledge required to make an informed decision on which product has the best quality, so they depend on other factors in their decision-making process – such as experts. And in the business world, the experts of a particular field are those companies which specialize. For example, if you wanted to buy a computer mainframe in the 1970s, you’d go to the leading specialist, IBM, whose products were regarded by experts as being of the highest quality. When it comes to selling quality products, it doesn’t matter too much that the product is of a higher quality, from a technological point of view. It matters only that the customers perceive that quality, because it’s they who’ll make the decision to purchase a product. But keep in mind that high-quality products do sell better, and this leads to better company performance. Consider, for example, the world’s best-selling soft drink: Coca-Cola. When people are asked why they prefer it to Pepsi or other soft drinks, most of them answer that Coke simply tastes better. So, specialized companies perform better compared to unspecialized ones, because they have the advantage of being regarded as experts in their field. Have you ever noticed something in your life that remained completely the same, forever? No? Well, the economy is no exception, and the changes that an economy undergoes are in large part due to changes in technology. And technology changes constantly, so with each new wave of technology that’s introduced a new economic demand is created; gradually, the new technology begins to replace the old. For example, two decades ago photography depended mostly on analog technology. So if you wanted to take a photograph, you needed to buy photographic film and get that film developed at a lab. Then came a major technological advance: the now ubiquitous digital camera was introduced. If companies don’t change with the economy they are going to be left behind. Consider George Fisher, the CEO of Kodak in the 1990s, who was convinced that analog photography wouldn’t be replaced by digital – at least not for a substantial number of years. Soon after, of course, digital photography took over most of the market. In 1992, Kodak was a $20 billion corporation and the market leader in analog photography. But as technology changed, the company began to struggle. By 1995, Kodak was reduced to a $13 billion company. Why? Because sales of photographic film dropped; consumers wanted to buy the new technology – digital cameras that didn’t require film. Since Fisher was so invested in analog photography, Kodak was unfortunately one of the last companies to market and sell digital cameras, therefore allowing other companies to become the market leaders in digital photography. Fisher’s reluctance to embrace a new technology cost his company dearly. Adapting a company to changes in the economy means shifting the company’s focus onto something that is needed in the “new” economy. To avoid the struggle Kodak found itself in, George Fisher should have paid more attention earlier to technological developments and adapted the company’s focus from analog to digital photography in time.  So far we’ve only discussed companies which have a single focus and perform excellently. But there are also large conglomerates, with several brands, that don’t have a single focus and are still well positioned. What’s their secret? In contrast to companies with a single focus, operating in a single market, conglomerates actually operate in several markets at once. Consider General Electric, for example. With sales of $64.7 billion and profits of $4.7 billion, GE are one of the most successful conglomerates, ranking fifth on the Fortune 500 in 1993 (the annual list of the world’s 500 most successful enterprises). Or look at Dover Corp., 361st on the list, with sales of $3 billion. It has 54 operating companies engaged in more than 70 diverse businesses. But why doesn’t this diversityresult in a critical loss of focus? The reason is that successful conglomerates separate their many different markets and build a focus for each one – a multi-step focus. This allows them to specifically target different customer segments and avoid any internal competition. Consider, for example, that in the early years of General Motors, the conglomerate was an unfocused mess. It had seven different brands, including Chevrolet and Cadillac, that were established in different markets. Their main problem was that some of the brands’ markets overlapped, because the price ranges of those brands weren’t clearly separated. This led to competition between the brands, who snatched at each others’ customers – which, for the conglomerate, meant a decrease in profits. When Alfred Sloan took over General Motors in 1921, he built a multi-step focus for the company. He selected five of GM’s automotive brands – Chevrolet, Pontiac, Oldsmobile, Buick and Cadillac – and distinguished them from each other clearly. Each brand had its own specific price range and would thus appeal to a different customer segment. The result? The brands wouldn’t compete against each other, and therefore the conglomerate’s profits wouldn’t decrease. The key message in this book: Although growth is usually the main goal of a company, it can often cause a company to lose its most important asset: its focus. Globalizing a company can diminish its focus, but specialization can often save a company. Also, specializing will help a company to succeed, because consumers are more likely to perceive that company’s service or product as being of higher quality.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

Our lives are filled with potential distractions: your smartphone, email, even your thoughts about where you’ll take your next vacation. As you let your attention become increasingly scattered by such distractions, you impair your ability to do your work on time and to do it well. Yet author Daniel Goleman goes beyond the narrow definition of “focus” to present a guidebook for living a focused life, according to which we can gain a richer, fuller existence by paying attention to ourselves, to others and to larger contexts, like our planet and the future. Drawing from a well of countless real-life examples, Focus provides many ways for the reader to enhance their level of attention, including practicing mindfulness, positive thinking and engaging in focused preparation. In these blinks you’ll learn why letting your mind wander can lead you to great insights but also hinder you in accomplishing your goals. You’ll find out why the best quality for a leader is not the ability to keep their eyes on the prize, but actually self-awareness or empathy. You’ll discover how to train your willpower like a muscle and how if you do something you love, seeing it through to completion requires much less effort. Finally, you’ll learn why when you’re stressed and can’t think straight, having a positive attitude will make a massive difference. Whenever you don’t check your email or phone for a while, do you find yourself fighting a remarkably strong urge to drop whatever you’re doing and take a peek? And if you do give in to the urge, do you feel somehow unsatisfied if there are no new messages waiting for you? We live in distracting times. The constant urge to respond to the overwhelming amount of information and stimuli in our environment leads us to a state of continuous partial attention in which we leap carelessly from one thing to another, from our phones to our email to Facebook and in doing so weaken our ability to select what we pay attention to. However, it is possible for us to focus, even when we’re surrounded by activity and stimuli. What we need is strong selective attention. Indeed, the stronger our ability to select what we focus on, the better we are at ignoring potential distractions. For example, journalists in an open-plan office at the New York Times manage to focus on their work and meet deadlines despite being surrounded by noise and other distractions. None of these journalists ever demand quiet so they can concentrate better. But not everyone’s selective attention is as strong. Most of us tend to daydream while we’re at work or distract ourselves with other time-wasting activities. For that reason, it’s crucial to increase our selective attention so we can ignore external distractions and accomplish our tasks. However, the distractions that engulf us not only threaten to waste our time and reduce our productivity, they also diminish our ability to immerse ourselves in a subject, reducing our chances of reaching a state of flow and thus learning and discovering new things. In fact, this issue is so prominent that internet addiction among young people has already been identified as a national health problem in many Asian countries. So if we can develop our ability to ignore distractions and focus well, we can help to increase our performance, and enable ourselves to have more profound reflections and deeper insights. Having the ability to focus is obviously an advantage, both in life and work, as it enables us to get into a flow state and perform better. But choosing to pay attention to one thing rather than another involves a push-pull process between the bottom-up and top-down minds. The bottom-up mind, responsible for our automatic and routine mental activity, is very fast, driven by our emotions, and impulsive. In contrast, the top-down mind, in charge of planning, reflection and learning new skills, is slower and requires voluntary attention and self-control. Those of us who rely on using our bottom-up minds are far more likely to lose focus and lose awareness of our immediate environment. For example, there was a time when you’d see long queues of people waiting to use the one photocopier in their office. One psychologist decided to ask a few people to jump to the front of the queue and announce, quite simply, that they needed to make some copies. Frequently, the person they asked would be “zoned out” from the tedious wait and would therefore let that person use the copier. Had that person at the head of the queue maintained active attention while they waited, they might have questioned the urgent request to jump the queue. Maintaining this kind of active attention also helps us to learn new skills. The myth of the “10,000 hour rule” is based on the notion that we can become experts at a particular task simply by performing it repeatedly. But this is not how we improve performance. Rather, we have to consciously adjust our execution continually. For example, if you’re a poor golfer, always making the same errors whenever you swing or putt, you won’t improve your game by spending thousands of hours repeating those mistakes. In other words, the difference between an expert and an amateur is that an expert will use the top-down mind to actively reflect on the automatic, bottom-up influence on their game, which enables them to continually improve their performance. It might not always be valuable to have a narrow focus or a goal-oriented type of attention. Sometimes it can be more effective to maintain an open awareness or mind-wandering. Rather than wandering away from what counts, we may well be wandering toward something valuable. This is because allowing our minds to wander provides fertile ground for serendipitous insights. It’s certainly a luxury to find a moment in the day when we’re alone and able to slow down and reflect. Yet such moments are extremely valuable, as they allow us to improve at tasks which depend on experiencing flashes of insight, like those which require quick, imaginative wordplay, or inventive and original thinking. In fact, people who are highly skilled at tasks which require an intense focus (like solving math problems) may find it challenging to switch off their minds and broaden their focus enough to generate creative insights. These people could follow the example of renowned cryptographer Peter Schweitzer: his work often required him to crack codes – an intensive mental task – yet he would do this while taking a walk or sunbathing. This kind of open awareness enables us to be creative, as it makes us completely receptive to new ideas. For that reason, open awareness is useful for imagining future scenarios, self-reflection, developing creative ideas and organizing our memories. In one experiment where participants were asked to come up with novel uses for a particular item, those participants who had allowed their minds to wander actually generated 40 percent more original ideas than those who were focused narrowly on the task. Moreover, people who maintain an open state of mind and have a strong disposition towards mind wandering include those with Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) and freestyle rappers, who improvise their lyrics spontaneously. The brains of both groups show a heightened level of activity in the circuitry that’s active while mind-wandering and it is this which enables them to make new connections between the distant areas of the brain. Accomplishing goals requires strong focus, motivation and determination – all qualities that constitute strong willpower. And the more challenging the goal, the more willpower we require. Our willpower plays a crucial role in determining the course of our lives. For example, it’s more probable that children who display a high level of willpower will become successful in their futures, compared to those who don’t show such self-control. In one major experiment, over 1,000 children took a series of tests that evaluated their capacity to handle frustration, restlessness, concentration and perseverance. Twenty years later, 96 percent of these children were located, and, then in their thirties, had their health, wealth and criminal record evaluated. The findings revealed that the better the person’s self-control in childhood, the more successful they were in their thirties. But self-control and willpower aren’t necessarily qualities you’re born with. They have to be developed throughout our childhood and even in adulthood. The most effective way to develop stronger willpower is to do what you love. This is because your willpower increases if your work reflects your personal values. Doing what you love motivates you to pursue your goals with determination, and the effort required seems worthwhile when you enjoy and care about the results of your work. However, many of us do work that isn’t in line with our values. We stick to the same safe routines – like the nine-to-five job – and so our work appears to require a huge personal effort. Consider George Lucas, for example. When he was making Star Wars, the extent of the movie director’s commitment t o his work and his personal creative vision led him to split from his production company and invest much of his own money into producing a movie that would be true to that vision. So rather than being accountable to a company that demanded changes that would compromise Lucas’s vision, he decided to take complete creative control in the belief that his vision was the right one. In order to have fulfilling interactions with others, we need to be empathetic, and empathy takes two main forms: cognitive empathy and emotional empathy. Cognitive empathy is the kind that enables us to see the world through the eyes of others. It can help us to comprehend other people’s mental states and the ways in which they understand the world. However, while this empathy allows us to observe, for example, that someone is sad – say, if their loved one had died – it doesn’t allow us to feel what they feel. Cognitive empathy is the kind that psychopaths have: they’re able to see what others are feeling but they lack the ability to feel with them – which allows them to manipulate others for their own purposes. Emotional empathy, on the other hand, does enable us to feel what others are feeling. Moreover, this is actually a physical phenomenon, as we sense other people’s emotions within our own bodies. In one study, for example, the brains of subjects were imaged while they were watching other people receiving painful electric shocks, revealing that the subjects’ pain circuits were indeed activated. In other words, the subjects’ brains simulated the other people’s pain. However, while these types of empathy allow us to both see and feel what others are going through, they don’t necessarily lead us to becoming sympathetic – that is, having concern for other people’s well-being. Consider doctors, for example. Doctors who don’t express empathy with their patients are more likely to be sued if they make a mistake, in comparison with those who demonstrate an authentic interest in their patients’ problems. For an already distressed patient, having an unempathic doctor will only serve to increase their anxiety. Yet at the same time, people want a doctor who will help them to get well, not one who’ll break down in tears whenever they have a problem. The ideal balance is to have empathic concern or detached concern. People tend to focus on what’s happening in their immediate environment and to plan only for the near future. The problem with this approach is that they neglect to deal with distant threats which might have a significant impact in the long run. Yet this is part of our nature: distant threats simply don’t trigger the same sense of fear as more immediate ones like not being able to pay your rent, or getting into a heated argument with a loved one. Future problems are too abstract for us to act on – for example, the effects of climate change – since their consequences may or may not be experienced and are a long way off. But although the predisposition to focus on our immediate problems is innate, it’s nevertheless a serious problem, as ignoring the larger context can be detrimental in the future. For instance, our planet’s resources, like clean air and water, will eventually be depleted unless we decide to focus intensively on preserving them. But we have to do this in a way that takes the larger context into account, because when we try to solve a problem by focusing narrowly on short-term results, any relief we get from the problem is short term also, so the problem arises again – often with worse consequences than before. Consider, for example, the problem of traffic jams. One solution is simply to build more highways. However, because highways make it easier for us to get around, this encourages new stores to open and more people to spread throughout the area. The result is that the traffic actually continues to increase because there’s now more capacity for it. As this shows, focusing on the larger context of any given problem enables us to care not only for any immediate effects but also the distant future. It is this which will allow us to lead fulfilling lives in which we care and attend to our planet, saving it for future generations. When it comes to leading a successful organization, focus is crucial. The ability to move an organization’s focus to the right place at the right time depends on the leader’s level of self-awareness. While a high IQ score may land you the job, it’s not enough to make you an outstanding leader. Unless leaders have self-awareness, it’s unlikely they will make an inspiring leader. We’ve all heard tales of bosses who are very critical of employees and seem to enjoy pushing them past their natural limits. This attitude creates a toxic atmosphere as their narrow focus on the “prize” blinds them to how they’re affecting the people around them. Now consider a leader that pays attention to her team, praises their small wins, and often admits that there are tasks that she herself couldn’t perform. Such a leader has self-awareness – she knows her own limitations and is able to assemble a strong team that will compensate for such gaps. She trusts in the abilities of others and allows them to do their job in their own way. Another reason that focus is crucial to being an effective leader is that the more focused and clear a leader’s vision is, the more likely they are to convince others to believe in and work toward it. A great vision is central to any strong business plan, but bringing such a vision to reality requires a brilliant leader who is able to communicate it clearly to others and convince them it’s a worthwhile cause. For example, consider the fantastic and radical vision of the founder of the Singer sewing-machine company, Isaac Singer. In the nineteenth century the prevailing assumption was that housewives would not be able to operate mechanical contraptions like sewing machines, but Singer’s vision was that they could and would buy the machines. To convince people of his vision, Singer even extended credit to women to make it easy for them to purchase the machines. Indeed, the product’s success propelled the company to worldwide success. Rather than being overly focused on the “prize” and remaining ignorant of the impact they have on the people around them, inspiring leaders strive to empower others and contribute to their community. Of course, companies require their leaders to produce great results. But rather than simply instructing others to perform certain tasks, a good leader focuses on identifying and developing other people’s potential. For example, the company Ben & Jerry’s uses actual brownies for their Chocolate Fudge Brownie ice cream, which they source from Greyston Bakery, located in a very poor neighborhood of the Bronx. Greyston Bakery hires people who have a difficult time finding work. Their motto – “We don’t hire people to bake brownies. We bake brownies to hire people” – is a prime example of an inspired leader’s vision. In contrast, unempathic leaders are unable to see and manage the impact they have on others. For example, consider the first few weeks which followed the BP oil spill disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. While innumerable birds and animals were dying and the Gulf’s people were condemning the disaster, the CEO of BP, Tony Hayward, told the media “there is no one who wants this thing over more than I do. I’d like my life back.” When he should’ve been showing concern for the victims of the oil spill, Hayward was instead expressing how much it had inconvenienced him personally and took no responsibility. This behavior prompted a wave of antipathy towards Hayward and BP due to the CEO’s lack of awareness of his impact on others and of how the public now perceived the company. This is a classic case of what can happen when a leader can’t see how their actions affect others and what kind of reactions they generate. To be able to anticipate how others react to your actions, you need to first understand how they see you and this demands self-awareness on your part. Successful leaders lead with a focus on the future. To do this requires exploring the broader context in which their organization operates, as this enables them to identify opportunities for growth in the market. For example, Steve Jobs took the brave step of reorganizing Apple’s portfolio: rather than concentrating their efforts on many different products, Jobs decided that Apple should focus on just four computers – a desktop and a laptop, each for two markets: consumer and professional. On the other hand, unadventurous leaders who remain rigid in their focus on exploiting existing products and technologies end up as victims of their own narrow vision. One of the best examples of this is the smartphone company BlackBerry. By the mid-2000s, BlackBerry had become a favorite with corporate IT, but just five years later it lost 75 percent of its market value. Why? BlackBerry was slow to notice the burgeoning popularity of the iPhone and other touchscreen smartphones with which companies allowed their employees to connect to the corporate network. Also, the company overestimated the attraction of long battery life, failing to recognize that users were more than happy to sacrifice it for the use of a touchscreen. BlackBerry is a classic example of what can happen to an organization with a rigid, narrow focus. Because the company trained its focus squarely on the existing, established technology rather than exploring for the next big thing, what was once an innovative company fell behind and couldn’t keep up with the tech waves which followed. To avoid being blindsided by the competition, leaders should devote much of their attention to exploring new opportunities for development. Attention is not an innate gift that you do or do not have. Rather, it’s a kind of mental muscle – one that you can strengthen and grow by exercise. One way to do this is to learn to be aware of when your mind starts to wander and correct this by refocusing your attention on a given target. Training awareness in this way is the essence of one-pointed focus meditation, which involves focusing completely on one thing, such as your breathing. As you do this, you’ll notice that after a while your mind will probably begin to wander. But that’s OK. The main thing is that you’re aware of the wandering and that you refocus your attention onto your breath and keep it there. When you inevitably lose focus again, simply repeat the process. As with weight training, the more repetitions you perform, the more powerful the muscle gets. The key to training your attention is being able to maintain an awareness of your own mental processes – like noticing when your mind starts to drift away from the object of focus. This is called meta-awareness. This kind of meditation can greatly enhance your ability to disengage your focus from one thing and shift it onto another. As with practicing meta-awareness, meditation helps us to recognize when our minds begin to wander and strengthens our ability to focus on what’s important. So the next time you notice yourself procrastinating or compulsively checking your email, make sure you register it and return your focus to the task at hand. This will be a great help to you when you’re under stress. Most of us have experienced “freezing” in the middle of a test and thought to ourselves, “I can’t do this. My mind is blank.” In these moments, practicing meta-awareness enables you to notice that you’re anxious and to take certain steps to calm yourself down – for example, taking a slow, deep breath – before continuing with the test. Have you ever noticed that when you feel positive even the most difficult tasks seem much easier? Why is this? One reason is that having a positive outlook boosts our motivation. Indeed, when we’re in a positive frame of mind, the left prefrontal area is extremely active – that’s the part of the brain that contains the “reward circuitry” that’s rich with dopamine – so as we work we’re reminded of how we’ll feel when we finally succeed and accomplish a particular goal. This is what motivates, say, a graduate student to continue working late into the night to finish their dissertation. Another reason for the positive effect of a good mood is that our focus shapes our reality and this has important consequences for the way we handle big challenges. For instance, feeling positive opens our minds to experiencing new things and meeting new people. If you’ve ever thought about moving to a different city or country you’ll know that it’s a scary step to take. But a positive person who has a cheerful disposition will view it as an adventure full of exciting possibilities, as positive thinking enables that person to focus on the new experiences that being in a new city presents and thus to actually embrace the inevitable changes and deal better with setbacks. This argument applies equally to making plans for the future. You’re more likely to feel optimistic about your long-term goals if you focus on what you’d really enjoy doing, on what skills you still want to learn and on the strengths you’ve already developed. On the other hand, if you allow yourself to focus on your failings and shortcomings, and on the competition and difficulties you’re likely to face, the result will probably be that you’ll become demotivated and therefore not take even the first step. The key message in this book: Staying focused has a great impact on our performance and thus our ability to become successful. A focused life in which attention to ourselves, to others and to the larger context – like our planet – are key components leads to a fuller and richer every day experience. This is equally valid when applied to leadership, as the success of any organization depends on its leader’s ability to effectively capture and direct the attention of a collective. Actionable advice: Like a muscle, focused attention requires rest. While it’s true that we have to exercise our focus to keep it “healthy,” tightly focused attention inevitably becomes fatigued after a while. It’s easy to notice when this happens: you’ll find yourself staring at the words on the page, unable to make sense of something that should be simple, or you’ll notice that your mind keeps slipping from the task at hand. When this happens, it’s a clear sign that you need to give your focus a break. The most effective way to restore your attention is to switch from top-down to bottom-up control. In other words, allow your mind to wander and to make whatever associations it makes. After a while, it will become clear that you’re ready to return to top-down mode, and you’ll do so feeling refreshed and clear-headed.  Try to make the problems of the future more concrete. Because we’re wired to care more about immediate problems and issues than distant ones, we’re in danger of neglecting to prepare for potentially devastating future events. Yet it’s clear that making concrete plans about the very distant (and abstract) future feels unnatural to us. One way to make the future more concrete and immediate for yourself is to use your full attention in imagining that those possible distant events pose an immediate threat. Our imaginations are so powerful that we can trick ourselves into “experiencing” all manner of possible (and impossible) events, and by doing so we can trigger the emotional cues that would usually prompt us to take action in the face of immediate dangers.

You have lost half of your staff, several of your factory buildings have been destroyed and supplies are scarce.  How do you manage? That’s exactly the situation many Japanese industrialists faced after the World War II – and manage they did. In fact, they found a way to elicit superb results with minimal resources, and Japanese industry experienced a meteoric rise as a result. As a manager, you’ll always want to achieve more with less. Luckily, it’s possible right now, anywhere, without an expensive upgrade in technology.  Many Western companies already emulate the thrifty Japanese modes of production, and thrive while doing so. So what’s the secret? In these blinks, you’ll learn about one of these techniques: Gemba Kaizen. You’ll find out how to analyze your work protocols, cut out anything that’s not necessary and involve all your employees in the process.  You’ll also learn how red tape can help you become more productive; how to get to the bottom of every problem with just five questions; and why it can actually be a good sign if a manager is not in her office all that often. So, you want your company to become more productive. Perhaps you’ll hire a specialized consultant, or invest in some new equipment. But increased productivity isn’t necessarily achieved by adding more. In fact, it’s often quite the opposite.  The Gemba Kaizen strategy guides you to greater productivity through elimination. When we analyze working processes, we often find several elements that consume time and energy without contributing anything to the end product.  These wasteful elements are called muda. By eliminating muda, we can free up resources, which in turn can be put to more effective use. For instance, muda could be overproduction, or the waiting time created by inefficient transportation. Even the time you spend walking from A to B is muda! In fact, the notion that walking is wasteful sparked radical improvements in a US hospital. Through clever design, the distances staff had to walk were reduced by several miles. Employees subsequently completed 100 percent of their tasks in half the time! Employees don’t just benefit from Gemba Kaizen efficiency – they’re also responsible for creating and implementing strategies. Employees, not managers, are in charge of the day-to-day work that presents the most opportunities for improvement.  That’s why Gemba Kaizen regards employees as the real experts. With employees playing the central role in boosting your company’s productivity, there’s no need for an external consultant or costly innovations. Instead, Gemba Kaizen expects every employee and every manager in a company to stay on the lookout for possible ways to improve working processes. Most people who hear “Gemba Kaizen” or “lean business” think about conveyor belts, car manufacturing and the like. But that’s only part of the story. Let’s look at the beginnings of Gemba Kaizen, when it emerged as the only strategy that could save Toyota.  Japan is a country with few natural resources, and after World War II, much of its industrial infrastructure was destroyed. Companies couldn’t afford to waste any assets or resources. Japanese employees were hired for life, so their continuous improvement became a vital factor for economic success, too. Thriftiness was vital for the economic success of any company, Toyota included. So, Toyota’s owner Toyoda Kiichiro and industrial engineer Taiichi Ohno devised the now-famous Toyota Production System according to Kaizen principles.  Even today, Gemba Kaizen is mostly used in industrial contexts. However, its basic idea – to improve productivity by eliminating unnecessary steps – is applicable to a wide range of disciplines and fields. Today, Gemba Kaizen is frequently employed by insurance brokers and hospitals. One method called clinical pathways is tightly connected to Gemba Kaizen. Clinical pathways is a plan used by hospitals to improve outcomes and reduce costs. It details all the essential tasks involved in treating patients with specific diseases.  Administrations employ Gemba Kaizen, too. Many Gemba Kaizen ideas are used in what is called “lean administration.”  Administrative acts, such as drawing up birth certificates, can easily be standardized and improved with the aid of a Kaizen approach. A few Romanian cities even used the Kaizen philosophy to keep their downtown areas safe and clean.  It’s no wonder many companies in different sectors use Gemba Kaizen nowadays. The idea of improving and reducing waste can be realized everywhere, from our workplaces to our personal lives. So how can you begin practicing Gemba Kaizen too? Find out in the following blinks! Though many corporations strive for efficiency, few are so outstanding in their organization as nature’s humble ant colony. So what’s the secret behind these incredibly effective insects? Ants achieve order through a set of simple standard processes, and we too can benefit from standards.  Standards represent the best known way to do things at a given time. With firm standards, everyone knows what to do and what’s expected of them. This eliminates mistakes caused by the idiosyncrasies of individual workers in one clean sweep. Think about it: when you’re new at a job, the first thing you look to are the workplace standards, so you can find your footing.  Standards work best when they change and improve as your company grows. Whenever a worker in your company finds a viable solution for some problem, you can adapt your standards accordingly – all while making sure that the solution doesn’t get lost in the shuffle and that everyone else profits from it, too. Imagine that workers on an assembly line have to constantly turn around to get tools from a box behind them. One of them puts the box in front her. Since she now needs no time for turning around and grabbing tools, she can produce more, and faster. It’s a good solution, so why not make it a standard procedure? Turning solutions into standards also empowers employees. Knowing that their best ideas can be implemented to help the broader workplace will give them a stronger sense of commitment to their job. And, of course, standards make a powerful impact on efficiency, even when the same equipment is used in a different way.   In 1961, two electronics manufacturers, one European and one Japanese, embarked on a joint venture. While both used exactly the same machines, the Japanese workers reached a higher productivity rate of 99.2 percent – solely through the use of standards – while the Europeans only achieved 98 percent productivity. This is just one example of the power of standards! But they’re not the only tool that’s central to Kaizen; self-discipline is vital, too. Self-discipline plays a key role in Japanese culture, especially in the workplace. The workplace, Gemba, is where value is generated. Kaizen philosophy influenced five powerful practices that use self-discipline to keep the Gemba streamlined. These are the five Ss. The first of the five Ss of proper workplace organization is Seiri, which means to sort out all unnecessary items from the Gemba. It’s a popular Kaizen technique, in which a leader will walk through the Gemba and mark everything that’s not essential with red tape. Next, the workers have the opportunity to object to any labelling and prove that a tagged item is necessary. After that, all items still tagged will be removed. After Seiri comes Seiton, which means to straighten things out. All necessary items maintain an orderly place, so that everyone knows where to find them at all times. The third S is Seiso: sweep the work floor, keeping everything clean and tidy. Seiketsu is the fourth step. It’s about systematizing the first three steps, which means ensuring your workplace practices Seiri, Seiton and Seiso every day. Going through these four steps finally builds Shitsuke, the last S. Shitsuke is about maintaining and standardizing what you’ve achieved so far. It implies becoming self-disciplined and doing the other four Ss as a habit. Some Japanese companies take the five Ss very seriously. On one occasion, a group of Japanese managers inspected a German factory that their company wanted to buy. But upon seeing workers smoking in the Gemba, they decided not to buy the factory, convinced that the workers had no self-discipline. The five Ss are the backbone of creating a Kaizen philosophy on a daily basis. A well-organized workplace is the starting point for other important Kaizen tools like visual management and reducing waste. More on those tools in the next blinks! These days you often hear people claiming to be visual thinkers. Well, the truth is that we all are! Pictures and charts are great aids for understanding abstract situations and concepts. And that’s where visual management comes in. This strategy employs a combination of simple visual tools to provide information on working processes.  Visual management helps identify problems and makes it easier to maintain standards. When a manager makes her rounds, she doesn’t have the time to play detective and look for hidden problems. Instead, visual tools will provide her with all the essential information. You can use symbols to indicate where a worker has to stand. If the manager walks through the Gemba and sees that the worker isn’t at his place, she’ll know that there’s something wrong. Visualizing also highlights the potential for improvement. If, using a whiteboard, you map out the day’s goals, the tasks already accomplished and the work in progress, you can tell with a single glimpse if there’s still something left to improve.  Imagine you have two production lines. One manufactures front tires, the other rear tires. If every completed pair is noted on the whiteboard, it becomes clear when one line is operating much faster than the other. To better synchronize both lines, simply exchange fast workers with slow workers and neither line needs to wait for the other. Visual management can also motivate employees by visualizing aims. It’s very rewarding for us to see our progress visualized – think of that great feeling you get from looking at a to-do list with every item checked off! To motivate your employees, why not plot each day’s progress on a chart? It’s a simple trick that yields a great positive impact. Visual management is an invaluable tool in an increasingly complex work environment. It’s cheap, commonsensical and allows us to save our time for the real work that needs doing. With the principles and practices of Gemba Kaizen in place, it’s time to consider the role of a company’s upper management. Gemba Kaizen isn’t just a strategy: it’s a mind-set. It must be practiced by the head of the company, and practiced in a way that provides a leading example for employees. Think of it this way: a hand couldn’t possibly carry out a motion without the necessary nerve impulse from the brain. A CEO must make it totally clear that Kaizen will be implemented and that everybody has to come on board; otherwise, the goals of productivity and efficiency just won’t be fulfilled. But people don’t always respond well to change. Sometimes employees need a little convincing, and the CEO is the best person for that task.  Take lean manufacturing legend Art Byrne as an example. When he enters a company as its new CEO, he personally trains the management in Kaizen, so everybody knows he’s behind it and that it has to be done. And he’s strict: reluctant managers get fired. A CEO also has to immerse himself in the Gemba, or workplace. For example, one CEO of a well-known company cleans the office toilets every morning, setting a model for self-discipline. That’s definitely one way to show that you walk the talk as a leader! CEOs should also remember that a focus on the future is more beneficial than dwelling on the mistakes of the past. A significant portion of a CEO’s time should go toward building an environment of constant improvement.  For example, one goal might be to reduce the amount of time spent on a specific task by five percent. Once that’s achieved, another goal has to be set to reach a new level of efficiency.  This redefining of goals helps to establish a process of constant improvement. Of course, it’s important for the CEO to be a “lean zealot,” but that’s not all. Read on to find out about another vital aspect of Kaizen leadership. To understand problems and maintain standards, the manager needs to be in touch with the Gemba. Since standards are the backbone of the working process, they must be maintained constantly.  Picture a pizza manufacturer where the mozzarella keeps spoiling over the course of each afternoon.  The solution is for all workers to wash their hands more frequently – this consequently becomes a standard.  New, improved standards can also arise from problem solving. But if the standards aren’t maintained, such as if the manager fails to check whether workers do indeed wash their hands, these solutions will quickly be forgotten. Constant improvement secures the future of the company. Every manager has to do his or her part to keep improvements coming. The place for improvements and innovations is the Gemba, so this is where managers should be. Only in the Gemba can one see where elements of Muda exist, and where there is room for improvement. Soichiro Honda, the founder of Honda, never had a real office because he was always walking through the Gemba. If the workers see that their managers are in the Gemba, demonstrate Gemba Kaizen and are self-disciplined, their own motivation will increase. Both maintenance and improvement occur within the Gemba. Therefore, the manager needs to be there to do his or her job right. Of course, if the managers are active at all levels of the Gemba, they know their workers much better and both sides have more faith in each other. This is integral to the effective practice of Gemba Kaizen. The key message in this book: Gemba Kaizen is driven by constant improvement and self-disciplined employees, with managers engaged at all levels of the workplace. Through a handful of simple, common-sense techniques, you can use Kaizen philosophy within your company to streamline, revolutionize and thrive.  Actionable advice: Ask five questions to get to the bottom of any problem.  The next time you try to get to the bottom of a problem, use the five-why technique. One should always ask why at least five times to get to the bottom of the problem. For example: Why is there an increase in absenteeism? Why are so many workers hurt in the Gemba? Why is the floor slippery? Why does the machine leak? Why is the valve not tightly closed? Soon enough, the answer will be right under your nose! Suggested further reading: Leading Change by John P.

And, on top of that, do you feel as though there’s nothing you can do about it – as though some people are just more creative, or have better problem-solving skills when it comes to math and technology? Well, think again. It’s actually far more likely that the brilliant people you admire are simply using more of their brain potential than you are. And they aren’t special. In fact, we can all learn to use our brain better. No one knows how to do this better than self-development guru Brian Tracy. In these blinks, based on Tracy’s innovative ideas, you’ll learn how to turn your mind toward success. With the help of a few simple rules, you can stimulate your brain and fire up those extra neurons. In these blinks, you’ll learn why you should covet your neighbor's shiny new Mercedes; how to think slowly and positively; and what poor mind-set led Borders books to bankruptcy. Let’s imagine you have a bank account with a balance of one million dollars. Now imagine you can only access $20,000 of that million. That’d be a pretty frustrating situation, right? But, incredibly, that’s pretty much how little access you have to the wealth of brainpower inside your head. Recent studies have discovered that the average person only uses around 2 percent of their mental powers. In other words, 98 percent of our potential power lies idle. But how much potential is this? Well, we all have around 100 billion brain cells, and each one of these cells is connected to about 20,000 other cells. According to Tony Buzan, an expert on the brain, if everyone could use all of their brain cells, each person could generate more ideas than there are molecules in the universe! Luckily, each of us is capable of tapping into this unused brainpower. To start, all we have to do is shift our perspective. How we look at and interpret life is incredibly important to getting the most out of it. For example, someone with an optimistic perspective will see a world full of potential and good, while a pessimist will only see problems and negativity. Faced with constructive feedback, a pessimist may become overwhelmed with his failure, while an optimist will probably see it as a chance to learn and grow. Unfortunately, our perspectives tend to be narrow and limited, as the following famous Buddhist anecdote demonstrates. Six wise blind men are trying to describe an elephant. The first man touches the elephant’s ear and says that an elephant is like a thick blanket. The second touches a tusk and decides that the animal is sharp and pointy. The third touches the leg and concludes that an elephant is like a tree trunk. The fourth touches the side and believes it’s like a wall. The fifth feels the tail and imagines a rope. And the sixth man puts his hands on the elephant’s head, which reminds him of a rock. They all have different perspectives, and though none of them is exactly wrong, each misses the full picture by focusing only on particular parts. We must broaden our own perspectives if we wish to avoid the same fate. In the blinks ahead, we’ll look at the ways you can shift your perspective to start thinking and living successfully. When it comes to planning in life, there are two perspectives you can take: You can adopt short-term thinking and concentrate on maximizing pleasure in the here and now, or you can think and plan long-term. Long-term thinking centers on being a step ahead and considering the consequences of your actions – and then the consequences of those consequences, and so on. So which is better? Well, an overwhelming majority of people who are happy and successful also focus on long-term thinking. In 1970, Harvard professor Edward Banfield, looked at people from different socioeconomic backgrounds and observed that the people who earned more money were the ones who thought ahead – often years or decades ahead. These are society’s smartest people. Yet their smartness didn’t come from having sky-high IQs; it came from their perspective, most notably their ability to think about how each of their actions would get them closer to their ultimate goals. And this is just as important today. According to Forbes magazine, there were 290 new billionaires in 2015, 66 percent of whom were self-made and had started off with next to nothing. To generate this wealth from a standing start, long-term planning is key. To join the ranks of these bright individuals, you must think about where you’d like to be in five years and then figure out what you have to do now to get there. This involves taking stock of your work and personal life, as well as your health and financial independence, and then making important decisions based on this information. But it’s always worth remembering: Just formulating a great plan is not enough; you also need to act on it. For example, are you thinking ahead about enjoying a comfortable retirement? A huge number of Americans – 70 percent, to be exact – live from paycheck to paycheck. They don’t think about saving or investing for the future; they prefer to think short-term, focusing on which car or gadget they can buy right now. When these people reach retirement age, they’re in for quite a shock. If you want to avoid this fate, you need an action plan. Set up a savings account immediately and, every month, deposit 10 to 15 percent of your income. Through the miracle of compound interest, relatively tiny investments made at a young age – even as little as $100 a month – can grow into massive amounts by the time you’ve retired. Every moment you delay or focus on short-term gratification will cost you in your old age. Human thoughts are generally a bit like the bubbles in a glass of champagne – each one vanishes soon after it forms, along with countless others. Though there’s always plenty of mental sparkle and fizz, there is a definite lack of real substance. Unfortunately, many of us let ourselves be dominated by these speeding, transitory thought bubbles. Rather than using our brain to think logically and sagely, we allow emotional, reactive thoughts to determine our actions. For example, when we get a ping on our phone, our brain compels us to instantly drop the task in hand and have a look. Or, when someone riles us up, our immediate, angry thoughts often lead us to lash out. But it doesn’t have to be this way. We can use our brain more effectively. According to Nobel Prize-winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman, there are two types of thought processes. There is the impulsive type of thinking that we just described, and then there is the slower, more rational process of thinking where we weigh all the options and make considered decisions. When planning important long-term goals, utilizing this slower method of thinking will lead to better decisions. The good news is that the slower method is pretty easy to engage; the longer you take to make a decision, the more chance you give your slow-thinking brain to come up with the best answer. Here are a few simple tricks you can use to slow down your thinking. One great tactic is to take 72 hours before making any important decision. This will give you ample time to carefully mull over the various options. Nothing gets the slow brain in gear like a period of solitude. Spending 30 minutes to an hour every day in a quiet, secluded spot will give your mind the time it needs to think. Shut off all distractions, such as phones and music, and let your mind flow like a river. Left alone to contemplate, it won’t be long before your mind starts generating great ideas and solutions. Finally, go through each stage of the author’s GOSPA model to think carefully when contemplating long-term strategy. Goals: What results do you ultimately want to achieve over a specific long-term period. For example, what growth target do you want to aim for over the next five years? Objectives: The smaller targets that will get you closer to your main goals. For example, what level of growth should you be striving for this year? Strategies: How will you achieve your objectives? For example, what marketing strategy will generate the required growth? Priorities: Identify the most effective actions that will make your strategy a success. Actions: The everyday work that will ultimately get you to your goals. Going through the GOSPA model, stage by stage, will allow your slow-thinking brain the space to reach the best decisions. Next time you need to think of long-term strategy, be sure to use it. So far, we’ve talked mostly about how shifting perspectives can help your personal development. In this blink, let’s look at how altering your mind-set can help you in the world of business. Here’s a question for you: Why is it that 80 percent of new products flop and have to be withdrawn? According to Forbes magazine, the main factor determining whether a business will make it is customer demand for their product or service. Quite simply, if no one is willing to use your product, you’ll fail. So how do you ensure that customers want what you’re selling? Intensive research is at the heart of all business success stories. If you don’t know enough about your potential market, you’ll fail. It’s as simple as that. Asking others is a great way to start. There is no substitute for expertise; experts in your field will almost certainly be able to assess the quality of your idea, so be sure to ask them. You should also look for people who’ve already trodden a similar path. A simple Google search for your potential idea will probably bring up information on what people have already found out. You can even ask these pioneers face-to-face. In short, go out of your way to get all the facts. Once you have a basic idea for a workable product, it’s time to find out whether people will actually buy it. But don’t only seek out evidence of your product’s greatness. This could lead to confirmation bias, where you fixate on only finding information that validates your idea. Instead, you need to behave like a scientist. Create a hypothesis about what you think your product will bring to the market, and then try to disprove it. For example, imagine you’ve created a new type of laundry detergent. Your hypothesis will be something like, “I think people will buy my new-fangled laundry detergent.” Next, you try and prove why your hypothesis is wrong. Go out and encourage prospective customers to pick holes in your product; ask them why they wouldn’t buy it, or why they should go with a rival brand. If they still seem interested despite your campaign against it, you might have found a winner. Naturally, this approach requires complete honesty on your part. If your idea or product is more important to you than the truth, then you won’t find out what you need to know about it. So adopt a total willingness to fail and learn – and judge your darlings by their true merits. We live in hectic times: Technology is developing at breakneck speed; information and new ideas can spread across the world in minutes; and competition – whether from a rival business or colleague – is fiercer than ever. In this hyper-dynamic world, many of us become overwhelmed. Our lives feel like a constant struggle just to respond to and keep up with every new change. Naturally, if you spend your life treading water like this, you’ll never be successful. So how can you escape this fate? Goals. Those with clear goals to pursue have a better idea of what information is important and what to ignore. Also, as they know where they ultimately want to be, those with goals can more easily adapt in the face of change. Despite their importance, real goals are pretty rare. Only around three percent of people have a set of clear, written goals to help them navigate through life. If you’re not among that three percent already, you should join them now. First, grab some paper; goals are most effective when made visible. Then begin by thinking about what you really want to achieve in the next year or so. Think of ten things you want to do. You may be able to achieve some of these goals pretty quickly, while others may take the full 12 months. Write each goal down in a specific way: use the present tense, make them personal and ensure that they are positive. For example, let’s say you want to write a novel. You’d write that goal thus: “I complete my novel by 31st August, this year.” Or, if you want to give up junk food, you wouldn’t use negative wording – “stop eating junk food” – but empowering phrasing, such as “I am a healthy eater.” Next, look at this list of goals and find the one that really stands out as something you want to achieve this year. Once you’ve found this goal, it becomes, in the author’s words, your “major definite purpose in life.” Take out a fresh piece of paper, and come up with at least 20 things you can do to make this goal a reality. For your novel, these mini-goals could be “research potential editors” or “complete writing classes.” Make this list into a checklist and tackle the first task ASAP. If you check something off your list every single day, it won’t be long before you’ve achieved your ultimate goal. We all know that, in order to get an education, children need to go to school. But it’s also at school that people pick up a very bad habit – a habit that will cost them when they enter the world of work. This terrible habit is play. From the moment we start school to the time we graduate, play is at the center of our childhood experience: we play in the morning, at recess, after school and on the weekends. The problem is, this desire to play doesn’t stop when we leave school and start working. Studies have shown that the average employee only really works between 11 a.m. and 3.30 p.m., and, even then, most of this short time is spent interacting with colleagues.    Unfortunately, this focus on play limits our ability. How? The most important asset you have in your life is your “earning ability” – what others are willing to pay you for completing a task. Being a success depends on how quickly and effectively you get stuff done. Therefore, if you want to join the ranks of the successful, you must spend every working hour actually working – not grabbing coffee with colleagues, wasting hours on the internet or endlessly checking your email or social media. Of course, focusing on the work at hand is easier said than done. The temptation to play and procrastinate is deeply ingrained in all of us. But, luckily, there are a few surefire techniques that will help you succeed. The Law of Three is one great method. The Law of Three argues that just three of your tasks will represent 90 percent of your results. The key, therefore, is to identify and focus all your work on these three things. To find these three crucial tasks, write down all the things you have to do. You’ll probably come up with a pretty long list, but don’t worry. Next, ask yourself three important questions. To help you identify the right answers, you should consult your closest colleagues or your boss. Out of all the tasks and duties you’re responsible for, which do they think are the three most important. Once you have your three, your working day should be focused on achieving them; your other tasks simply don’t matter. That way, you’ll get the right stuff done, and you’ll grow your earning potential. Our world is constantly evolving. In fact, we’re living in one of the most tumultuous times in human history. Therefore, to be successful, you need to be aware of technological advancements. Just consider the cautionary tale of Borders, the massive book retailer that went out of business after the Kindle and the iPad revolutionized the print industry. Borders was bankrupted by its obliviousness, and if you want to avoid a similar fate, you’ll have to use flexible thinking. Flexible thinking can be best described as the ability to quickly react and adapt in the face of dramatic change. Unlike the executives at Borders, flexible thinkers will grasp the importance of change and innovation and adapt accordingly. But how do you develop the right mind-set for flexible thinking? The best way to keep yourself from falling into a comfort zone is to conduct what the author calls zero-based thinking. To do this, you must constantly question the value of everything you do. More specifically, you should ask yourself a hard question: “If I got the chance to do this from the beginning again, would I?” Ask this simple question in every area of your life: for example, are you friends with a coworker who, if you started working at the company today, you wouldn’t befriend? Maybe there is someone who you used to love hanging out with but who you now think holds you back. Or maybe you’ve made a business decision or career choice that you realize you shouldn’t have? Whatever uncomfortable conclusions zero-based thinking turns up, you must be ruthless in undoing these “mistakes.” This isn’t easy; you’ll need to admit that you made the wrong choice, and, even more importantly, you’ll have to accept that your investments in these areas – whether it be time, capital or emotions – will be lost. You simply have to accept this, and cut your losses. Painful as it is right now, it’ll be better in the long run. Luckily, as hard as it is to cut out the activities that no longer bring reward, the results are worth it. You’ll come out with more time, more energy and an enormous sense of relief. What’s more, you’ll become more flexible. You’ll find yourself in a better position, ready to drop the things that slow you down and grasp the new opportunities that come up. If you enjoy cooking, you know that a first attempt at following a new recipe can often lead to culinary disaster. But a good cook learns from these mistakes, tries again and might even end up with a new favorite dish. Smart thinking works the same way: you have to take chances, make mistakes, learn from these mistakes and find creative ways to improve. This is the opposite of mechanical thinking. Mechanical thinkers believe in extremes – things are either a complete success or a total failure, with no room for anything in between. They also tend to reject novel thought, due in part to a fear of failure. But this fear of incurring criticism and ridicule often leaves them stuck with old ideas and methods. Naturally, these people are not very successful, since they rarely get out of their comfort zone or make changes. You can recognize a restaurant that is run by a mechanical thinker because such restaurants seem stuck in the past, with fading fixtures and the same dull, out-of-date menu. Creative thinkers, on the other hand, hold the keys to success because they are constantly striving for improvement. Where mechanical thinkers fixate on the problems, creative thinkers focus on the solutions. To start thinking creatively yourself, follow these simple steps. Start by looking at what you do and look for a problem. For example, if you’re a business owner, think about what is holding your business back. Once you think you’ve defined your “problem,” your next step is to admit that, actually, you haven’t. Your conclusion is almost certainly too broad, so start breaking it down. For example, you might have defined your problem as “not having enough revenue” – but think again. Maybe it’s because “not enough people are buying your product,” which leads to “people prefer your rival’s product,” and then “your product isn’t compatible with the latest technology.” Keep working until you come up with the real underlying issue. Once you have your problem, it’s time to find a solution. Work hard and get the help of your team to find it. Once you have one, you can probably guess what you need to do next. Yes, that’s right: keep going and identify even more solutions. Make a list of them, before finally deciding on which one you think will work best. Then, assign Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to this solution (these will show you whether your solution is working) and appoint someone to take overall responsibility. Then set a deadline for its implementation. Of course, there is a chance that your solution won’t work out, so develop a few back-up plans just in case. By applying this structural approach to finding creative solutions, your business stands the best chance of staying ahead of the game and thriving in an ever-changing world. What’s the secret of wealth? Why are some people rich while the rest of us remain poor? What’s their secret? As surprising as it might sound, the rich don’t really have one. Anyone can become rich if they start thinking like a rich person. This is because of the Law of Correspondence, which states that the way you position yourself internally – that is, your outlook on and perceptions of life – will be reflected externally. For example, if you perceive yourself to be worthy, hardworking and an asset to the world, you’ll find yourself succeeding. The Law of Correspondence really works: when the author was poor, he once witnessed someone in the same evening school as him rock up to class in an expensive, beautiful Mercedes. He wanted one immediately. So he started thinking like a rich person. He read up on billionaires, he found a better job and he worked longer and harder for his employers. Very soon, he’d earned enough in bonuses to be able to buy himself the very same Mercedes. He’d become a success because he started thinking like a successful person. Like the author, if you want to be rich, then it’s time you developed a wealthy mind-set. To do this, you should start by analyzing what wealthy people do. Watch interviews with billionaires and read up on them. Especially, look for the habits that make them so successful. Habits are probably the most important element to becoming successful. After all, they determine 95 percent of what you do. So focus carefully on developing powerful ones. To make a good habit – for example, waking up very early – focus on one element at a time and endeavor to do it every single day. After 20 to 30 days, you’ll probably have made this habit a part of your life, and you can move on to the next one – say, carefully planning your tasks each week, or managing your investments to get the best results. And even if you’ve developed a few good habits already, you shouldn’t rest on your laurels. Wealthy people are always on the lookout for new opportunities to grow, so you should be also. Keep researching and learning. Your wealthy mind-set depends on it.  The key message of these blinks: There are good and bad ways to use your brain. You can have a distracted and unfocused mind that only wants to learn about things that reinforce your negative preconceptions, or you can have a sharp and creative mind. The latter sees the positive things in life and finds success by being inquisitive, adaptable and innovative. So stop procrastinating, use flexible thinking, write down your goals, change your perspective and adopt the mind-set of the rich. Actionable advice: See the chance in every challenge. Take a moment to think about your biggest problem. Now, instead of thinking of it as a problem, try to think of it as a gift – an opportunity to learn something about yourself. Maybe it’ll provide insight into your behavior and provide a chance for you to change the future and be more successful.

For people working as consultants, however, the ability to forge strong relationships is essential. In these blinks, we examine the importance of making oneself vulnerable in order to create a lasting working connection with clients. The blinks will also show you how to overcome the three fears that prevent many consultants from becoming truly vulnerable and open. In these blinks, you’ll learn why you should never hide the fact you’re sweating; why “stupid questions” are rarely stupid; and why you shouldn’t be afraid of doing your client’s dirty work. Most people hesitate to let their defenses down, and nobody likes feeling vulnerable. But that discomfort runs contrary to human nature. In truth, the ability to feel vulnerable is essential to building deep and lasting relationships. Naturally, a commitment to relationships is key if you work with others, and it’s especially important for consultants. So what might that vulnerability look like in a work context? Take sweating as an example. People are taught never to let others see their perspiration, but that’s impossible. Worse still, when people notice that you’re sweating and trying to hide the fact, you lose credibility. That’s why, if you find yourself in a situation in which sweating is inevitable – say a meeting that’s stressful and hot – it’s best not to hide it. By being open about the fact, you’ll relieve others who will feel comfortable showing that they’re sweaty too. From then on, you’ll be treated like a member of the team, rather than an outsider trying to make a sale. This essential change will enable you to focus on your real job, which is to help, not to sell your opinion as a product. So, vulnerability is important, but it’s definitely not easy. After all, humans naturally fear appearing weak. However, that’s all the more reason to overcome the fear, because only by being undaunted by phobias can you embrace vulnerability. By learning how to stand “naked” in front of other people and bare your true, honest self, you’ll discover transparency, credibility and dedication. It sounds great, right? Well, next up you’ll learn how to overcome your fears and make that confidence a reality. As a consultant, it’s only natural to fear any loss of business. The problem is that you can’t show that fear. If you seem to care more about your own business than the needs of your clients, you’ll only exacerbate the issue. So, what’s a better approach? Tackle your fear of losing clients head on by putting their needs first. As you might have guessed, that’s going to mean getting vulnerable. It’ll be scary, but rest assured it’ll pay off in the end. For instance, you should never begin a relationship with a discussion of fees. It’s smarter to just do your job and present the value you offer. Such a humble and self-confident style will be sure to impress any client. And don’t worry, they won’t take advantage of you. When customers see you truly looking out for them, they’ll be happy to pay and won’t worry about micromanaging you. So as long as you focus on your consulting and the needs of your clients, you’ll have nothing to fear. But just to be safe, there are two other rules to follow. First, it’s important to be honest, yet kind with your clients. If they have a business idea that just doesn’t convince you, let them know, but respect their feelings. Recognize the work they’ve done and communicate how much you care. Second, keep in mind that it’s better to face danger than to put it off or ignore it. Just consider discussing a risky business move, like the introduction of a new product. There are always going to be people who only see the danger of such a choice. Often, these people are ignored, and the discussion continues as if they’d never opened their mouths. The problem here is a fear of confrontation. But if you can attend to the people who are afraid of launching a new product,you’ll please everybody with your ability to acknowledge reality and handle conflict. You need to overcome your fear if you want to be able to face risks! Imagine a scenario in which you have zero medical knowledge but are consulting for a hospital. Every third word you hear sounds like gibberish, and you don’t know what to do. Is it better to pretend you understand everything or to embarrass yourself by letting your ignorance show? Well, whatever you do, it’s essential to be prepared to ask dumb questions. After all, there will always be others in the room who don’t understand and, even in a hospital, not everybody knows every medical term. Not just that, but your questions might not be as dumb as you imagine. In fact, when all is said and done, your clients will forget the “stupid” questions you asked and remember the gems. Every question keeps the discussion going and is, therefore, valuable. So, you shouldn’t fear dumb questions, and the same goes for dumb suggestions. Feel free to shoot out ideas and celebrate the mistakes you make. Just like dumb questions, suggestions that you consider stupid likely aren’t stupid at all. Others are probably thinking about them too, and people will only remember the good suggestions you make. For example,  suggesting that a company work with a competitor that operates in a different market might sound insane, but it could also offer a great path toward growth. And finally, if your question or suggestion really is dumb, be comfortable celebrating the silliness. That means being OK with laughing at yourself. Just take the hypothetical scenario at the hospital. Maybe you forgot that it’s a non-profit. It’s definitely a dumb mistake, but you’ll earn the trust of the group by being able to acknowledge and celebrate it. You can apologize in a friendly way – say, by offering to get lunch for everyone. They’ll see that the issues they’re working to address are more important to you than saving face. Most people want to be considered important and to be treated as though they’re worth their salary. Therefore, it makes sense that you shouldn’t take on petty tasks like setting out chairs or picking up coffee, right? Well, actually, that fear of inferiority is a huge hindrance. It’s not like the simple fear of embarrassment because overcoming it doesn’t mean taking an intellectual risk. Instead, conquering this fear is about getting over your pride and your desire to be the center of attention. It’s also about being ready to take a figurative bullet for your client. Say your client poorly organized a conference and you need to interrupt every other speaker to keep things on schedule. You’ve got to fall on your sword and take responsibility for the hassle. Then, after the conference, you can tell your client the honest truth, which is that the conference wasn’t well organized. Rest assured that she’ll be grateful both for your honesty and for your loyalty. However, doing the dirty work goes beyond taking the blame; you also need to honor the work your client does. After all, if you fail to show enthusiasm and respect for your client’s work, you’ll never be able to muster the will to do the dirty work in the first place. For example, if you consider gambling and alcohol to be immoral, you’ll never be able to effectively consult for a casino or a bar. That means you should strictly avoid such clients as the outcome will always be poor. And finally, doing the dirty work is about downplaying your own role through an attitude of service. This is important since there will always be clients who need you to wait on them. If you can rise to the challenge, they’ll see how helpful you are. Rather than viewing you as inferior, they’ll see you as dedicated. Just keep in mind, you’re being paid to help. So, show your clients that you’ll do whatever needs to be done and build a relationship on a sturdy base of trust. The key message in this book: Vulnerability is not something to fear; it’s actually an incredible strength. While fear prevents us from making ourselves vulnerable, by overcoming such trepidations we can succeed like never before. It’s uncomfortable, but getting figuratively “naked” in front of others is well worth it. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

To be your own boss? Work from home, maybe? Well, most people do. In order to achieve these goals, more and more people are thinking about becoming consultants. Consultancy allows you to use your expertise, while also giving you the freedom to decide whom you want to work for. And yet, many of those who get into consultancy fail, never managing to get their fledgling businesses off the ground. By reading these blinks, you’ll learn how many people go wrong, and what you can do to avoid similar mistakes. If you follow the expert advice below, you’ll stand a much better chance of making your consulting business a success. In these blinks, you’ll discover how much money you need to save before starting a business; what you can do to beat the tax man; and why you should never, ever get paid based on working time. Have you ever thought of going into consulting? It’s a fine idea. Consultants often have highly lucrative careers. Yet, many of those who attempt to leap into the profession don’t make it; they attempt to start a consultancy and fail miserably. Why? Usually it’s because they didn’t make a strong start. If you want your business to succeed, you’ve got to take a few key steps. First, you must ensure you’ve got the time and money that your business needs to get off the ground. It takes about six to twelve months to get a consultancy up and running, and this time must be entirely devoted to consulting. During this period, financial rewards are usually meager. But by setting enough money aside to keep yourself afloat, you can make it through this tough initial stage without a hitch. To be able to save enough funds in the first place, you’ll need to plan ahead. Reduce your monthly expenses as much as you’re reasonably able to, and calculate how much money you’ll need to support yourself for a year. Then, based on your estimated needs, establish a fund for that year. Possible sources include home equity, savings, credit lines or family. As you establish your business, the planning doesn’t stop. The key to dealing with time pressure is prioritization. The most effective way to prioritize is simple: make a list of all the tasks, professional and personal, that you need to accomplish. Then, complete each one when you’re in the best mood or position to do so.   Another great way to lighten your workload is by delegating as many tasks as you can. If there are tasks on your to-do lists that will take up vast amounts of time, or if they require skills you lack, then pass them on to someone you trust. And then there’s the material aspect of your consultancy. Find out more in the next blink! If you’ve worked out how much you need to save for your first year and you’ve prioritized your time, then it’s time to get your consultancy going! This means finding a place to work, and some equipment to work with. As a consultant, you have many different workplace options, and each has its pros and cons. Consider having a home office. This is a good option if you’ve got the necessary space in your home. It should be a quiet, closed-off area with a door and enough space for all your office equipment. The main benefit of the home office is that it costs nothing. But don’t let this tempt you if you don’t have the space! If a home office doesn’t suit you, another option is a shared working space. This is a facility where you’ll have your own space to do your consulting, but you’ll share certain services with other professionals. Shared working spaces have the advantage of access to professional services such as a receptionist and copying and faxing. But you’ll need to pay a fee. These spaces can cost from $300 to over $2,000, and you’re also subject to the opening and closing times of the space. Finally, there is the formal office. This is by far the best solution in terms of productivity for your business, but it is prohibitively expensive. If you can find a formal office that you can definitely afford, then great! If not, leave this option alone, at least until your business is fully established. As well as a working space, there are also some basic, but crucial, services and pieces of equipment. Aside from a computer, vital tools include a two-line phone, a fax machine, a copier, voicemail and a postage scale. In total, you’re looking at somewhere between $1,250 and $2,000. Yes, it all adds up, but without these necessary expenses, you won’t be able to do your job as well as you’d like! Any budding entrepreneur needs to have some tax savvy. If you want to avoid extra costs (and stay on the good side of the law!) then it’s time to start learning. Finding your company’s tax status is the first challenge. As this can get very complicated, your best bet is to consult a professional. However, there are a few things you can do before you seek advice. Start by defining your company as an S corporation. This means that you do not pay corporate tax. Instead, you are taxed on your income from the business, so you won’t pay tax twice. You’ll also be able to declare expenses against the tax, helping to cut down your tax bill. Among costs that count toward company expenses are medical bills, director’s fees and meetings, home-office expenses, memberships and subscriptions. You can always change the type of corporation you are, which allows you to change to a more suitable model when you start making more money. As well as settling things with the tax man, it’s essential that you start building business relationships with a bank and other professionals. Developing a bank relationship entails finding a bank where there is an officer familiar with your business, someone who can offer you professional assistance. Building a relationship with an individual officer will also help you circumnavigate generic customer service and get your problems and queries dealt with faster. You may need to establish relationships with other professionals, too – people who can design your logo, get you insurance or supply you regularly with materials. Once again, personal relationships are great for getting things done more quickly. If you’re unsure where to find these organizations, ask the relevant trade association to provide you with contacts. With your company founded and registered, it’s time for you to start promoting it. In the next blink, we’ll talk marketing! With your business newly established, you’re ready to start working with some clients. But where do you find them? Remember: A consultant doesn’t call potential buyers to sell them a service. Consultants get called by buyers who want services. If you want customers, your name needs to be out there, and to achieve this you’ll need to start marketing. Begin by preparing some basic promotional materials; these are the building blocks of your marketing campaign. Your press kit should include the following: the results your clients can expect; a small biographical blurb mentioning relevant successes and listing references; and, finally, an outline of your area of expertise. Impeccable presentation and stationery is a must for a professional look, so make those letterheads and business cards look good! Of course, marketing isn’t purely done on paper; it happens in real time, too, through networking. Start seeking out places where you might find people who can influence your target customers. For instance, you could appear at media events to find publishers who could put an article of yours in their magazine. Or you could head to conferences, so you can network with influential players in your clients’ industries. You might even be able to convince them to recommend you to their potential clients. Finally, consider doing pro bono work – work that you decide to do for free. It’s best to conduct pro bono work that supports non-profit organizations, as there’s no need to give away your services to for-profit businesses. Pro bono work can have great long-term benefits for your self-promotion, helping you build a word-of-mouth reputation. So go where there are people who have an influence on your target customers. Now that you’ve got an understanding of marketing tools, you’ll need to figure out what message you want to send. Your business needs a branding strategy, just like any other. No matter what type of consulting you do, you’ll face stiff competition from rivals. So how can you get an edge? By building yourself a brand. An official website and social media are great tools for boosting the presence and popularity of your brand. By establishing a credibility website, you’ll have an online presence that demonstrates your company’s  professionalism. It should feature a clear image of yourself, a succinct explanation of what you do, what your services are and how clients will benefit from your guidance. A credibility website works best when it isn’t covered in special offers and promotions. After all, it’s not an online shop! It should be sleek, professional and serious. Social media, on the other hand, is a more dynamic promotional tool for your brand, and it can be fantastic for building awareness. But don’t go overboard! Clients won’t usually hire their consultant on the basis of a tweet, so don’t spend more than 90 minutes on it per day. Though the internet is a brilliant tool, don’t disregard print media, radio and television. Publishing your material in an independent magazine greatly increases credibility. Always be ready to contact publishers and editors with ideas, highlighting why your articles will be interesting for readers and why your credentials make you an expert. Interviews, whether on podcasts or radio, are another opportunity to promote yourself and your consultancy as experts in your field. If you’ve written a book or essay, make it available for sale on your website. Finally, don’t pass up the opportunity to reach out to local groups by giving presentations at facilities such as the Rotary Club, Chamber of Commerce and Service or civic clubs. If you’ve successfully established your brand and gained your clients, your next step is formalizing your proposal. We’ll find out what this entails next. Say you’ve followed the advice in these blinks and a client, interested in the services you offer, has reached out to you. How do you convince her that you’re the person to sign with? First, when you’re presenting your proposal to these kinds of people, you should always be sure to provide lots of options as part of your services. The more options and extras you offer, the more opportunities you’ll have to increase profits. If the client doesn’t immediately accept, don’t despair! There are measures you can take to improve your chances of closing the sale. If a buyer asks to discuss the matter with you in person, organize a meeting as quickly as possible. Before the meeting, prepare carefully; learn about the clients’ businesses and needs, and be confident of all the options your service provides. During the meeting itself, stay as flexible as possible. Listen attentively to the buyer and make considered responses to any issues she may have. But remember: only accept a reduction in fees that corresponds with a reduction in the value of your services. If the buyer does not respond to your offers, call him once a day for three days. If you don’t have a response within a week, send a letter. After two weeks, send a final letter alerting the buyer that the proposal is valid for only 30 days.    After this, no more action is required of you. Dealing with unprofessional people is a waste of time, so don’t let it frustrate you. And if your proposal is rejected, don’t stress – it’s not the end of the world. Keep in mind that the same buyer might accept another proposal in the future. Ask to remain in contact and offer informal assistance from time to time. Of course, to make an effective proposal you’ll need to know how to set and deal with fees. The next blink outlines the steps you can take to maximize your income. Lots of consultants that do fantastic work simply don’t get enough money for the effort they put in. Why? It comes down to some basic errors in how they establish their fees. So how do you avoid this in your consultancy? First, be very clear about one thing: you are selling your services, not your labor power. When establishing fees, do not charge for the amount of hours you put in, but for your expertise in the field. By setting an upfront fee, you’ll free yourself from the temptation of working longer to boost the bill. The client will also have an exact idea of how much they will pay for your services, which obviates the possibility of any nasty surprises at the end. And, most importantly, you’ll be able to charge more. Selling your professional services demonstrates to the client that your expertise is worth paying for. Selling your labor simply doesn’t have the same effect.   There are a few other things that will ensure you get adequately paid for your work. First, never agree to getting paid on the condition that the project is completed satisfactorily. If you do, you leave yourself at the mercy of fluke occurrences that are beyond your control. Maybe the company has a terrible work ethic and the staff refuse to heed your suggestions. Why should you have to suffer for their inability to act on your advice? Moreover, in working with clients, always try to maintain a strong personal relationship. Stay in touch with them and offer them additional advice. This keeps them coming back to you, and makes them more willing to recommend you to others. With all the steps for establishing your consultancy business explained, what’s next? The last blink reveals how to maintain and improve your business – and your professional life, too. After all the hard work of setting up your business, you shouldn’t just sit on your laurels. Once your consultancy is a success, you’ll need to manage it, consider hiring some collaborators, boost income and start choosing your clients more carefully. But how do you know if your business is doing well in the first place? Well, it takes at least three years before you can evaluate whether your business is successful. So what are the criteria? First off, you receive more business by passive marketing (word-of-mouth recommendations and so forth) than through active solicitation. Returning clients constitute about 75 percent of your business, while new relationships comprise a mere 25 percent. You have time for at least two weeks’ vacation per year, and the running of your practice doesn’t require 24/7 attention. Finally, you can afford to reject clients without threatening your reputation or income. If your business is a success, then it’s time to get growing. Make sure you only hire employees who increase your productivity enough to make it worth paying them. And don’t confuse ego with business; controlling a big staff doesn’t make you more important. During growth, don’t start second-guessing your approach. If your marketing has achieved so much for you already, then keep doing what you’re doing. Success in your business also means it’s time to start thinking about what you can do for yourself. For example, by sharing your experience with younger people as a mentor or teacher, you’ll be able to help them grow while also experiencing a powerful sense of fulfillment yourself. And, when you have enough demand for your services, feel free to choose the projects that you enjoy, rather than those that bring in the most income. Working on initiatives that you care about will help you develop as a person, so that you can start doing what you really love. The key message in this book: There are several steps to creating a great consulting business, and by investing time and effort in each, you’ll be able to make a strong start in your new profession. Once your business is off the ground, you can then turn your focus toward growing your business, sharing your wisdom and, above all, doing fulfilling work.

The fact is, in most workplaces, people have been conditioned to appreciate a person’s competencies over their values. And while a person’s skill set is important, no amount of marketing magic or workflow wizardry can make up for an average character. A people-first approach might sound fluffy, but it’s actually a savvy business decision. Placing values above competencies, investing long-term in human capital and compassionately mentoring your workforce creates a positive workplace culture, improves productivity and creates real value. But first we need a shared framework for defining goodness, living up to values grounded in goodness and resolving tensions when they arise. In these blinks, you’ll find out how Benjamin Franklin used to practice integrity; what a US airline can teach us about respect; and five key questions to ask if you’re a mentor. If you think about the word “good,” your mind probably grasps at various definitions and forms a stew of multiple associations. After all, does a “good” dog really have anything in common with a “good” idea? “Good” has become so overused that it’s lost any clear meaning – and things get even messier in the world of business. If you call your coworker “good,” are you referring to her well-balanced personality and core values or do you mean she’s competent at her job? Often it's the latter. In fact, an employee’s goodness is predominately measured by skills and competencies – not by their human nature, values and moral code. That’s partly because measuring someone’s goodness in competency is easy. From technical skills to academic accolades, goodness in competency has plenty of measurable markers to choose from. Think about your last job interview. Did any questions try to uncover your core values or conception of humanity? Chances are, the interview was based solely on things like your industry knowledge and spreadsheet skills. These are important, but goodness in values – instilled in employees and wider business culture – is even more crucial to corporate success. It’s a mistake to view the principal tenets of goodness – truth, compassion and wholeness – as “soft skills” that can be neglected. Workplaces that genuinely incorporate these values display happier, more productive workforces. These values cause positive change in the world and benefit the bottom line – there’s nothing “soft” about them! This makes sense, because stripping away a company’s margins and market share leaves nothing but a group of people determined to achieve a common goal. Financial health is contingent on the relationship between people, their values and the workplace’s culture. Why wouldn’t you want these things to radiate goodness? Just consider the WD-40 Company, a popular manufacturer of household products. It is uncompromising in its people-first philosophy. WD-40 views its staff as their top priority, and mentorship at the company is taken quite seriously: a WD-40 supervisor’s sole responsibility is her team’s well-being and success, and thanks to this, the approval ratings for superiors is regularly around 96 percent! The financial impact? Today, WD-40 is valued at over $1.5 billion, and staff turnover is three times lower than the national average. So, goodness should be distinguished from personal competencies or a business’ balance sheet. That’s all very well – but what is goodness, and how can we be good? There’s no easy answer, but adopting the Good People Mantra helps. This is a practical framework which guides our behavior and identifies goodness in others. It has five basic principles: First, be people-first. This means proactively placing human beings above ideas, targets and even profits. This is easier said than done. Harvard Business School professor Georges Doriot argued that, given the choice, most people will choose a great idea over a great team. Why? Because most of us get excited about inspiration, not the disposition of our colleagues. Doriot believed this is a mistake – a great team can adapt, motivate team members and transform average ideas into stellar ones. People create ideas, but ideas don’t create people. Second, assist others in becoming better, fuller versions of themselves. Doing this requires patience, honesty and above all recognition of our shared humanity – understanding that we are all imperfect human beings. On this common ground, we can encourage people to realize their unique potential and help them blossom. Third, prioritize a person’s values over their competencies. This helps us better identify goodness in others. Industry experience might look good on paper, but core values and belief systems tell us more about future potential. Fourth, channel balance and pragmatism when practicing goodness. We live in an imperfect world full of competing priorities, between which tensions will inevitably arise. Navigating these tensions with a clear head is vital to keeping them from limiting what we can achieve. For example, the author stresses that in his organization, Zappos, he seeks a balance between idealistic and pragmatic employees. The former he values for their optimism and energy, while the latter are crucial for implementing ideas and strategies. Fifth, we need to consistently practice goodness. Too many people do so only when they’re being observed or see a clear advantage for themselves. But this runs counter to goodness’ core principles of truth, compassion and wholeness. Goodness requires that we consciously and consistently live up to our values, internalizing them until they become a core part of ourselves. In a way, the Good People Mantra fuels goodness. It’s clear, standardized principles keep the engine of goodness running. But an engine needs to power something, and the most effective vehicle for goodness comes in the shape of a pyramid. A three-tier framework, the Goodness Pyramid offers us a shared vocabulary about what goodness actually is. At its base is truth. Unless you are truthful to yourself and others, you won’t be able to act and think authentically and congruently. Without it, your foundation for goodness will be hollow. But truth is more complex than it seems. Truth itself is comprised of three core components: humility, self-awareness and integrity. Truth starts with humility. Being humble to those around you helps maintain a lifelong intellectual curiosity, and boosts your sense of humanity. And it’s also a key leadership trait. The media focuses on hard-nosed executives and no-nonsense CEOs, but leadership imbued with authentic humility inspires coworkers to be humble, down-to-earth and devoid of arrogance. That’s why Jim Collins, in his 2001 book Good to Great, described humility as the most essential trait in the world’s best business leaders. Next, truth is about self-awareness because this allows you to intelligently reflect on your strengths and weaknesses, ultimately becoming truthful with yourself. But self-awareness is also a skill – and one that can be strengthened in many ways. Writing, meditation, psychometric tests and seeking out feedback from peers are all activities which, when undertaken with an open mind, increase our capacity for reflection and self-awareness. Truth’s third element is integrity, because this trait ensures a truthful coherence between your professed values and actual behavior. A great exercise for measuring integrity comes from Benjamin Franklin. Each week, Franklin would draw out a simple table, writing the days of the week along the top and the values he strived to live up to along the left-hand side. Every day he would judge if he’d lived up to his professed values, and if he had he would tick the corresponding box. This is a simple but highly effective way of practicing goodness and ensuring integrity. Consider a world where everything revolves around truth. Sounds good, doesn’t it? Well, yes and no. Sometimes the truth can be cold, hard or even brutal. Sometimes, as the old saying goes, the truth hurts. That’s why truth isn’t the aim of goodness – it’s merely the starting point. To truly define goodness, we need to look to the center of the Goodness Pyramid – compassion. Compassion is an exercise in complete selflessness. It looks outside the self and allows us to perceive the feelings and experiences of others more clearly. Despite that, it can be difficult to see a place for compassion in the cutthroat world of business. That’s because in traditional business settings, we've been conditioned to equate compassion with weakness and ruthlessness with professionalism. That’s why hiring practices are often guided by the mottos “weed out the bottom” and “hire slow, fire fast.” But practicing compassion is crucial in building a unique, inspiring and productive workplace. In fact, it helps catalyze performance and motivates teams to nail important deadlines and organizational objectives because they can clearly see how the team’s success impacts those around them. Compassion has three anchoring values: openness, empathy and generosity. Firstly, openness is a state of mind which counters negative biases, allowing optimism to seep through like light through the cracks and making it easier to feel compassion. One good way to practice openness is by following the 24x3 rule. Designed to prevent hasty judgements, it imposes a minimum wait time of 24 seconds, 24 minutes or 24 hours before responding to a colleague’s idea. In this time, you explore all the possible advantages of the idea before delivering your verdict. Empathy is the attempt to understand another’s feelings. Good people possess high levels of empathy, allowing them to effect positive change in the workplace by better connecting with their coworkers and feeling compassion for them. And the best way to practice empathy is by asking genuine questions. From simple things like “How are you, really?” to heart-to-heart inquiries like “Are you happy working here?” Finally, generosity is the last anchor of compassion. Generosity benefits the giver and the receiver, making it key to bridging the age-old divide between compassion and competition. For example, author and professor Adam Grant observed in his bestseller Give and Take that the most collaborative, generous students in American medical schools tended to fare more successfully in their future careers. Maybe you’ve heard the saying “life is a marathon, not a sprint.” If it rings a bit hollow, maybe this is because it assumes that everyone measures their life against a neatly defined objective. Replace “life” with “wholeness”, on the other hand, and the saying makes a lot more sense! Wholeness is both the highest point on the Goodness Pyramid and the hardest to achieve. Wholeness is a state of being, and it comprises three elements: love, respect and wisdom. But it’s the search for wholeness – a search which never truly ends – that is important. The search for wholeness is the highest expression of someone’s goodness. Love might sound strange in a business context, but it’s not about developing romantic attachments to your coworkers! Instead, it’s about caring deeply for others’ well-being and happiness. And it also means possessing a love for your company’s brand and values – in short, loving what you do. In his book, Lovemarks, former chairman of advertising firm Saatchi & Saatchi Kevin Roberts argues that love and respect should become central pillars of the brand-consumer relationship. Brands, therefore, should ignore “trademarks” and instead create “lovemarks” – memorable moments that leave authentic imprints on consumers. Beyond that, wholeness is characterized by respect – both for yourself and for others. Consider how US airline JetBlue reacted to the disastrous fallout from delays caused by an ice storm on Valentine’s Day 2007. With public opinion of the airline plummeting, JetBlue CEO David Neeleman issued a public apology full of respect and empathy for how customers had been affected. Neeleman took full responsibility and explained how JetBlue would prevent the delays from happening again. Using the old-school approach of “the customer is always right,” he put respect for the consumer front and center. The final trait of wholeness, wisdom, puts intelligence and experience into practice. It helps distinguish important things from unimportant, enabling us to make better choices. In a business context, this could mean knowing the difference between a fad and a trend that’s here to stay. True wisdom is more than this though. It also allows us to distinguish between factors we can and can’t control and prevents us from dwelling on the latter. It helps us make more accurate assessments, and better appreciate complexity, so that we can see life as black, white and a thousand shades of grey. This ability to read situations clearly is especially important when we face the tensions of the real world, as we’ll see in the next blink. Do you remember how, as a kid, your paper plane never flew as perfectly as you’d have liked? Well, the same can happen when you practice goodness in an imperfect, contradictory world. Designing a shared framework for goodness is one thing, but implementing it in the real world is quite another. We’re always going to encounter tensions at work – even when we try to implement goodness. And these can often act as roadblocks to our good intentions, forcing important trade-offs. One tension is between short-term and long-term thinking. Though most of us understand the importance of planning for the future, our decision-making still tends toward short-term rewards. But why is this? Well, it’s partly because of Amara’s law, which says that we overestimate short-term effects and underestimate long-term effects. Just look at the culture of instant gratification we’ve built in business; public company CEOs struggle to improve their short-term gains every quarter, and investors typically make trades with the hope of selling at a profit in a few years’ time. But building anything meaningful takes patience and skillful navigation of the tension between long-termism and short-termism. We have to be particularly vigilant, of course, about our bias towards the latter! One shining example of this vigilance is prolific investor Warren Buffett, whose successful long-termism is the stuff of legend. In 1999, Buffett received a torrent of negative press for not investing in the then-ballooning dot-com bubble. Critics slated him, labeling him old-fashioned, conservative and behind the times. Instead of responding, Buffett quietly exercised patience, having the integrity to stick with his long-term growth strategy over making a quick buck. In March 2000, when the dot-com bubble began to burst in dramatic fashion, Buffett’s strategy was vindicated. And this thinking applies to people, too. By mentoring colleagues – both personally and professionally – we tease out their full potential, transforming them into strong individuals who add real value to our company in the form of human capital. We can do this by generously sharing our specialist knowledge and skills, providing honest but kind feedback and instilling individuals with a powerful sense that they can realize any objective they wish to. So, tensions inevitably arise between goodness and an imperfect world – but how should we act when they do? Well, there’s a four-step decision-making process we can use to untangle our reasoning and make sense of difficult, complex situations. It’s called the R.I.S.E framework. To use it, begin by recognizing a situation. This means evaluating its risks and potential outcomes, and also having the wisdom to set realistic expectations for these. We should not waste energy dreaming up perfect but impossible solutions. When Singapore won its independence from Malaysia in 1965, then-Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew recognized that improving Singapore’s port infrastructure was vital for the nation’s economy. But he also realized the challenges this would pose to locals through the transformation of their communities as immigrants would pour in– a clear tension between idealism and pragmatism. By recognizing the situation early on Lee was able to navigate this tension successfully. For example, he established the Central Provident Fund: a statewide pension plan and corporation that enabled citizens to feel ownership of their country. The next step in R.I.S.E is to internalize the situation before we act. This goes past recognition, and the goal is to deeply understand the issue at hand and mentally explore all potential outcomes. And internalizing a situation works especially well in the world of investment. For example, when Anthony Tjan co-founded MiniLuxe, a nail care services company, he was in no rush to get going. Even after an accepted business plan, all partners spent a huge amount of time internalizing the concept in minute detail. This patience paid off: today MiniLuxe is over ten years old and impacts hundreds of thousands of people, from shareholders and employees to suppliers and customers. Third, it’s crucial we share our reflections on a situation with a select group of good people, whether it's mentors, coworkers or family. Doing so gives us the benefit of multiple perspectives – perspectives which might contribute a different, previously unexplored angle on the issue at hand. Finally, it’s time to execute. The essential factor here is to have the conviction that the decision is the right one. A great way to boost our conviction – and bring in elements of self-awareness – is to turn to pen and paper. Once we’ve made our decision we should write it down, along with why we made this choice and our logical reasoning behind it. In the future, this will aid us in the process of learning by reflecting on previous decisions and instigating a positive feedback loop. Striving for goodness is important for all businesspeople. But when we’re in positions of leadership and authority, it becomes absolutely imperative. Once we possess a high level of responsibility and the power to influence the lives of people we lead, the Good People Mantra stipulates that we must attempt to inspire, motivate and help them realize their full potential as human beings. And by incorporating goodness into our daily practices, we supercharge our abilities to mentor and become inspirational leaders. This starts with a key distinction between mentoring for training and mentoring for goodness. Just as most of us tend to recognize competencies over values, most mentor-mentee relationships tend to neglect the teaching and pursuit of goodness in favor of measurable business skills. These are important, but the mentoring relationship should first focus on authentic connection between partners and establishing a common set of values. Doing so renders mentoring for training both more enjoyable and effective. So, we need to authentically connect with our mentee before we drill down into technicalities. But what’s a concrete way of using goodness to become a better mentor? Well, we should exercise our compassion and empathy to become better listeners. This sounds counterintuitive, because it feels like the mentee should be doing all the talking. But it makes a great deal of sense: genuinely listening and being receptive to our mentees enhances our understanding of the relationship, deepens trust and sparks inspiration. When asking questions, it’s crucial to avoid what author Margo Feiden calls “phatic communication.” Phatic communications, Feiden argues, are everyday words and phrases which are convenient, meaningless and entirely procedural: think “how are you?” or “if you don’t mind …” These should be avoided, in mentorship and also in life, as they’re devoid of compassion. We don’t truly listen to the answers, and eliminating them is a sure-fire way of becoming a more compassionate and empathetic listener. Here are five critical questions that good mentors should ask mentees: What are you truly trying to achieve? What are you doing well that is helping you get there? What is slowing you down? What will you change tomorrow to help you get there faster? How can I help? These questions are important because they strike an important balance between discovering the truth and offering compassion. What’s more, they do so authentically, without phatic communication. Overall, when we live according to the Good People Mantra, strive towards the Goodness Pyramid’s values of truth, compassion and wisdom and recognize tensions as they arise, we can supercharge our work environment, foster goodness in others and become good people ourselves. The key message in these blinks: We’ve been conditioned by corporate culture to value a person’s competencies over their values, but in truth, the latter are far more important. Skills are more easily measured, but a person’s character is what adds meaningful, long-lasting value to a company and its culture. We need a new framework for defining goodness and guiding our actions and another for dealing with tensions which inevitably arise when we practice goodness in the real world. Practicing goodness can make us better employees, mentors and human beings, but also benefits the bottom line. Actionable advice: Practice phatic abstinence  Phatic communication, you will remember, refers to the phrases in our language which have become so routine they’ve lost their meaning. To build up your empathetic reasoning and listening skills, try to go a whole day without communicating in phatic language.

Culbert","summary":"In general, work conditions in the United States may be better now than they were 30 years ago, but how does the quality of management in your place of employment stack up? Are you unable to challenge the ideas of those higher up on the corporate ladder? Do you sometimes feel like your needs in the workplace aren’t being met? Do you find yourself asking your coworkers about their weekend, even if you don’t really care what they have to say? If you answered yes to any of these questions, you’re not alone. In fact, this kind of negative workplace culture is common in businesses around the United States. Workplace culture, along with other factors, teaches managers the wrong habits, and once poor management techniques become habitual, they can become difficult to do away with. But there’s good news. With the tools and guidance provided in these blinks, you’ll learn how to overcome this toxic culture, be a good manager and a good person. In these blinks, you’ll learn the importance of using the first-person pronoun in business discussions; why managers are taught to be deceitful and inauthentic; and how to change negative workplace culture. People around the world admire the work culture in the United States. American businesses are perceived as successful and innovative, so couldn’t you assume that these companies have flexible, kind, talented and effective managers? Sadly, this is not the case. In reality, bad management is the rule, not the exception. Annual polling by US research company Gallup finds that four out of five people in management don’t have the talent to manage effectively. While there are many exceptions, particularly in start-ups and small businesses, the prevailing experience of employees in most companies and organizations includes bad management. Interestingly enough, results of an academic study showed that the most useful thing a manager can do to help employees is simply leave them alone when they are working productively, rather than offer misguided help. Additionally, bad management is so entrenched in our work culture that people expect it, shrug it off or don’t even notice it. Just consider the actions of Carly Fiorina, one of the 2016 Republican presidential candidates. In 2006, when she was CEO of Hewlett Packard, Fiorina secretly eavesdropped on the IT company’s board of directors. For this, she was fired. Nonetheless, she was invited to join the board of the telecommunications company AT&T, and, when she ran for US Senate in 2010, she won the votes of more than four million Californians. So, despite her poor management, people were able to forgive or ignore her misbehavior in the context of workplace culture. But bad management must not be ignored; it should come under heavier scrutiny. Think of how much more profitable businesses could be, and how high the level of employee satisfaction could rise, if bad management weren’t so commonplace. To find out why it’s become so common, let’s move on to the next blink. We admire those who fight their way to the top, battling difficult circumstances or overcoming great hurdles. It’s the stuff American dreams are made of. And so maybe it’s not so surprising that the business world is all but defined by self-focus. In other words, when it comes to business, managers focus solely on their own success, not the success of those who report to them. Those in management may not admit it, or even realize it, but they’re usually self-focused,even if they really do have good intentions. Too many managers have a Boy-Scout mentality – they’re so concentrated on performing “good deeds,” the managerial equivalent of helping an old lady cross the road, that they fail to notice the needs of others. The problem, though, is that the Boy Scout, by focusing too much on being helpful, can fail to realize that he’s not meeting the needs of the person he claims to be helping. More often than not, the old lady didn’t even want to cross the road! Good managers, on the other hand, eschew self-focus in favor of other-focus. It’s a little like parenting. Parents want the best for their children. They help their kids find enjoyable activities, and then assist them in pursuing their interests. Similarly, good managers ask questions, understand others’ needs and create the necessary conditions for their employees to achieve success, all while maintaining a two-way relationship. Most managers understand the importance of this relationship. For instance, when asked about their experience of being managed, most managers complain about not getting the attention and support that they need from their managers. Managers also want to hear “What do you need?” – not “I need this from you!” – from their supervisors. Unfortunately, that doesn’t seem to be how American business culture operates. The American dream doesn’t encourage managers to prioritize the success of others over their own. But there’s more to it than just the American dream’s reinforcement of this type of culture in the workplace. Let’s press on to see what other factors contribute to poor management. In business schools across the United States, people skills are referred to as soft skills – and these are thought to be inferior to the hard skills that enable one to boost the bottom line and increase profits. The problem is, this preference for hard skills has a detrimental effect on management. Here’s just one example of how business schools fail to teach MBA graduates about being a good manager. Business schools may teach their students about interpersonal skills, such as active listening. But how many are teaching real reflection, like, for example, reflecting on how your personal background impacts your worldview and your interactions with others at work? This kind of introspection is crucial when working with alternative mind-sets, but it’s a skill that is rarely taught. And then, after graduation, business students enter the workplace, which breeds conformity, not honesty. Over time, people learn that not rocking the boat, and avoiding any expression of frustration, is the way to get by in the workplace. To climb up the corporate ladder to positions such as senior manager, or executive of the board, you need to stay in line. For example, in 2014, the new CEO of the Los Angeles Times announced a new holiday policy. Employees of the company no longer had a set number of vacation days. Instead, they had to ask for time off, and if the manager could spare some staff, they were allowed to go. Of course, this angered the employees, who feared that the managers suddenly had extra power over them. Because of this, they were too afraid to speak out. On the other hand, the managers themselves feared the pressure from their managers, and hesitated to sign off on too many vacation days. They, too, were afraid of stepping out of line. This left everyone unhappy. The new CEO might’ve made a better decision had he taken the perspective of his employees, or if more managers had felt free to speak out against the bad idea. So the need to survive in America’s tough workplace culture can drive and enable bad managerial decisions. But that’s not all. In the next blink, we’ll look at how far those bad behaviors can go. Have you ever lied to your boss? Now think carefully: has your boss ever lied to you? Deceit is a core management characteristic; huge amounts of time and energy are devoted to it. Disagree? Consider the following behaviors: being friendly with someone you don’t like, participating in a meeting that’s a waste of time, staying quiet on a controversial issue, getting someone else to deliver bad news, exaggerating your role in the success of a project, preparing an excuse in case you’re questioned. Have you ever witnessed, or done, any of these things? We all engage in these routine behaviors because of a workplace culture that breeds pretense, frowns on dissent and expects perfection from imperfect humans. Managers pick up these deceitful habits, too, which prevent them from focusing on their employees’ needs. First, managers make a show of it when consulting colleagues for guidance on a new course of action. They ask for opinions, appear engaged, nod their head to show that they understand. More often than not, however, their mind is already made up. Commitments have been made, and there is no going back. Then, managers will often invoke the voice of a powerful authority to get their own way. This is known as borrowed authority. They might say something like, “I’ve talked with Ted, and this is how he thinks we should do it.” Ted could be the CEO or a respected management consultant – anyone, really, in an authoritative position. Invoking an authority figure simply enables managers to get what they want without having to make any arguments themselves. This constant need to self-promote and self-protect is exhausting. Small wonder, then, that managers have trouble paying attention and keeping up with the needs of their employees. We all know there’s inequality in the workplace. So why does it still exist? Because culture is hard to shift. It’s the same with bad management. Bad management is hard to shake because there are structural incentives to keep it in place. Most managers are confident that they know what is needed in order to get results. They believe that simply telling their employees what to do is quicker and easier than taking the time to understand, guide and support them. And, at least in the short term, it is quicker. Meanwhile, it’s hard for employees to force change on their manager. Let’s say you’re unhappy with your manager. You’re overworked and feel like you’re not getting the right support. At the same time, you know there is a promotion opportunity coming up, and that your manager will have a say in who gets it. Most likely, you’ll keep quiet, fully aware that this isn’t the best time to be bringing up his poor management skills. Too often, change can’t be incited from the bottom. And so it has to come from the top. As a business consultant, the author set out to change the mentality of a global 150,000-employee corporation in a program driven by a committed CEO. When presenting his ideas on how to change the company’s business mentality to the HR team, he received a non-committal, “Okay, we will take it into account.” It was only with the active and invigorated support of the CEO and other leaders that new management systems could be introduced. In other words, to bring about change, you need a CEO or other very high-ranking member of the company who sees the benefits of your idea. Leadership is essential, but there remains one key change that needs to happen before better management can be achieved. Let’s check that out next. When managers are used to being self-focused and directive with their employees, it can be hard to know how to change. So here are some concrete ways that managers can become other-focused. First, replace performance reviews with two-way conversations. Performance reviews, though ostensibly objective, tend to be extremely biased, not to mention damaging. Not only does a single manager’s personal opinion get recorded as a factual report on your abilities and imperfections; the one-sided, hierarchical nature of reviews also intimidates employees into remaining silent about management problems. A two-way conversation, however, like the one the author developed during his work with a major global corporation, opens up a dialogue and eradicates employees’ fears of speaking up. The author’s two-way conversation system centers around four questions: What has your contribution to the company been? How has your work reflected our company’s values and goals? How have you helped other people to succeed? How have you changed your behavior, based on what you’ve learned? The second method to lessen the self-focus of managers is to introduce two-way accountability. Taking the concept of two-way conversations one step further, two-way accountability has both the manager and the employee answer these four questions. A coin is flipped to see who goes first. That person then answers the four questions while the other listens and takes notes. After that’s done, they swap roles, so that, in the end, both manager and employee give feedback on their own performance. Instantly, the two-way approach breaks down hierarchies and frees both parties to be a little more honest. Unlike the traditional, one-way performance review, both parties get feedback, allowing them to reach an honest conclusion about how to improve. Two-way accountability is a big shift away from the traditional way of doing things. But the impact of an honest exchange on personal relationships and business productivity makes it completely worthwhile. To better manage employees, leaders should replace the core cultural expectations that drive bad management with a new mind-set. Our desire for immediate results, our expectations of perfection and our association of punishment with accountability are just a few of the workplace’s unhelpful cultural expectations. We expect excellence even though humans are not excellent by nature. For example, employees are expected to say, “I don’t know, I need some help with this.” But too often, the workplace environment doesn’t really allow people to admit imperfection or weakness. To allow for improvement, we need to actively encourage people to say, “I don’t know,” when that’s the case. Furthermore, managers should seek feedback. As an example, let’s take a look at the American company Home Depot. The company assigned members of the board to walk down a number of store aisles each quarter, allowing them the chance to chat with employees, who, in turn, were encouraged to provide honest opinions. Because the talks were explicitly confidential, managers were able to discover that there was deep unrest about pay and the lack of opportunity for female employees. The search for useful feedback paid off: when they were hit with a gender discrimination lawsuit, the company saw it coming and had already taken steps to improve the situation. To become a good manager, one should also prioritize honesty. The author teaches leaders and managers about the importance of honesty by insisting that they use the first-person pronoun. So, for example, in a meeting, rather than saying, “We need to do this,” try, “Let me tell you how I see it….” This allows the other person freedom to say, “I see that a different way.” And if they don’t respond, you could always try asking, “Do you see it differently?” Using the first-person pronoun encourages honesty and can transform relationships. Managers become better when they genuinely listen to and understand the thoughts of their employees and coworkers. A bigger emphasis on honesty and authenticity will allow managers to spot any problems immediately, and, as a result, cultivate a happier workplace. The key message in this book: Most managers mean well, but they are often distracted by their need to succeed and the pressures that come with that. Thus, they fail to fulfill their responsibilities to support the people they manage. Good management requires other-focus – that is, seeking to understand and support the needs of others, rather than focusing on yourself. Implementing an other-focus management system will result in happier and more productive employees, which is the surest path to a more successful business. Actionable advice: Point out bad management behavior when you see it. The first step toward change is raising awareness of the failings and limitations of current management behavior. You now know the warning signs: self-focus, inauthenticity and management that is directive rather than supportive and other-focused. Exchange your observations with your peers. Their experiences will help enrich your understanding of the problem and help you articulate your case. Keep this conversation going and you can start to build the buzz that might just prompt your leaders to start making positive change. Got feedback?

Ultimately, both set out to achieve the same goals, and yet their outcomes are vastly different. As it turns out, part of this difference lies in what we actually consider to be a strategy; in other words, losing strategies may not even be strategies at all! These blinks offer you insights into strategic thinking by drawing from the experiences of successful – and sometimes disastrously unsuccessful – cases. By examining the wisdom gathered from these different examples, you’ll learn about the anatomy of a successful strategy, how to apply it to your life or business, and how to become an effective strategic thinker. You’ll also learn: why you should be wary of sexy-sounding fluff how one man’s epiphany in Italy lead to a chain of 4,500 coffee shops how to look beneath the obvious to find the hidden powers of a situation and maximize their impact how a little geometry led to the death of 50,000 Roman soldiers and finally, you’ll grasp what all good strategies have in common – and what the bad ones lack. So what is a strategy, exactly? Consider this: the “2005 key strategy” of a major graphic arts company was a 20 percent revenue increase and a 20 percent profit margin. Does this sound like a good strategy to you? The short answer: No. In fact, these are simply goals – far removed from a working strategy. A vision or a goal is simply a stand-alone idea. A strategy, however, is a set of different ideas that includes a plan to achieve these goals. Often a goal or a vision can be a perfectly fine starting point for a strategy. However, the strategy itself must include precise information on how these goals will actually be achieved. For example, if your football coach advises your team to win the next game, he isn’t providing you with any useful information unless he tells you how to win. In other words, he must provide a plan of action – a strategy. It’s not only our goals that are often mistaken for strategies; motivational slogans and buzzwords sometimes get passed off as strategies too. This is usually made obvious by an absence of clear, simple words. In these cases, “fluff” – superficially restating the obvious while applying a heaping portion of buzzwords – takes on the appearance of high-level thinking. The fundamental strategy of one major retail bank is a perfect example – in their own words, they offered “customer-centric intermediation.” Let’s unpack this, shall we? “Intermediation” means simply that they take deposits and lend them to others, and “customer-centric” means that they focus on the customer. By taking the fluff and unraveling it into simple, meaningful language for the layman, we quickly discover that their “fundamental strategy” for banking was simply “be a bank!” What’s missing in both these business examples is a plan of action. Essentially, if you have no plan of action, then you don’t have strategy. It’s natural for each strategy to look different, since each is tailored to meet one specific need. However, there is one essential component to every successful strategy: the kernel. The kernel is composed of three parts: the first two are the diagnosis and the guiding policy. The diagnosis is a simple analysis of an often complex set of circumstances, and the guiding policy lays out the approach that will be used to tackle this diagnosis. One example of these components at work can be found with IBM in 1993. During that year, IBM was on the decline – their previously successful strategy of offering complete computers no longer worked in a fractured industry where many computer companies had started offering individual parts. While many believed that they should adapt to this fragmentation, CEO Lou Gerstner developed a different diagnosis: instead of fragmenting IBM’s different departments, they would instead integrate and centralize them to become new market leaders in IT consulting. In order to enact this diagnosis, they then created a new guiding policy that focused company resources on customer solutions. The final component of the kernel is a set of coherent actions that ensures that the guiding policy is effective. In other words, the actions needed to achieve the goals of the guiding policy can’t contradict one another. One example of a failure to establish coherent actions can be found in the Ford Motor Company. When they acquired Volvo, Jaguar, Land Rover and Aston Martin, their new guiding policy was to exploit these brands and simultaneously take advantage of economies of scale. This led them to consolidate the design and manufacturing processes between the brands. However, this approach lacked coherence, since the value of these brands lay in their unique qualities. Volvo buyers don’t want a safer version of a Jaguar, just as a Jaguar buyer doesn’t want a sportier version of a Volvo, and Ford’s strategy suffered for it. Most people don’t like to choose between two things – they’d rather just have both. Unfortunately, this is rarely possible – when forming a strategy, the choice of one thing over another is simply unavoidable. A good strategy demands that you prioritize what’s most important and focus your resources there – trying to have it all will leave you struggling. For example, in 1988 computer manufacturer Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) was struggling to compete with a new type of PC. Executives couldn’t decide how they should respond to this new situation: they were torn between focusing on building ready-to-use systems, customer solutions or new microchip technology. They were told to find a compromise, but they just couldn’t, and ended up failing to choose a single direction and act on it. Finally, in 1992, their new CEO decided that they would focus on chips, but it was too little too late. By then they had missed the boat and been overtaken by competitors, and were eventually bought out by a rival company. Unfortunately, tough choices will often damage other areas of the business, and thus encounter strong opposition. However, you must have the constitution to overcome this and drive through the decision anyway. For example, Intel found itself having to make hard choices after many Japanese companies in the manufacturing market made it tough for them to compete. Their CEO, Andy Grove, was forced to make a decision and shift the company’s focus to manufacturing microprocessors. This move met opposition from many areas of the business, including the salespeople and researchers, who were attached to the old habits and processes. While it might have been less stressful to back down in the face of opposition, Grove instead persevered with this new direction. And a good thing, too: by 1992, Intel was the world’s largest manufacturer of semiconductors. Now that you’ve learned about the anatomy of a good strategy, the following blinks will explore how these strategies can be applied for maximum effect. Once you have a strategy,how do you use it to gain an advantage over your competitors? In short, you need to ensure that your strategy offers you leverage over your competitors, i.e., that you anticipate opportunities before your competitors have a chance to act. Anticipation, however, doesn’t mean foreseeing the future; it means having an insight into the present that enables you to spot emerging possibilities and act on them. We can gain some insight into leverage by looking at Toyota. Even while they were profiting from booming SUV sales, Toyota invested more than $1 billion into engineering hybrid electric-gasoline technologies. Why? Their insights had shown them that the dwindling supply of fossil fuels would eventually drive demand for hybrid cars, and that if they could pioneer the first acceptable hybrid technology, other manufacturers would then license their system rather than develop their own. In other words: they would gain leverage. In order to anticipate an opportunity (and thus gain leverage), you must identify your market’s central pivot point – meaning the best way to succeed in that field. The convenience store chain 7-Eleven did precisely that in Japan when they discovered that their Japanese customers easily became bored with the same selection of soft drinks. To exploit this, they identified the central pivot point: variety. To accomplish this, they created a strategy around this point. The average 7-Eleven store can stock only 50 varieties of soft drinks – only a fraction of over 200 brands available in Japan – so the firm created a system to maximize soda variety on their shelves by researching and recording local tastes. Each store would then sell a range of brands that appealed to those local tastes, thereby allowing 7-Eleven to shift an enormous variety of drinks. By identifying and focusing on the pivot point, 7-Eleven gained leverage over rivals whose stores lacked what the Japanese market wanted. By now you might be thinking that you’ve fleshed out a good strategy for your business. There is still some important work to be done! You should ask yourself: do I have the resources for this, and does it reflect my current situation? A good strategy is composed of actions that are based on your current situation and all fit together to maximize your advantage. One classic example of a pristine strategy can be found in ancient history with the military maneuvers of the Carthaginian general Hannibal. When Hannibal invaded the Roman Empire in 216 BC, he soon ran into trouble: at the battle of Cannae, he was met by a Roman army that outnumbered his troops by 85,000 to 55,000. So what did he do? He created a strategy based on his limited resources and current situation. First, he had his men form an arc, the middle of which then pulled backwards to feign a retreat as the Romans approached. The Romans then charged after the retreating soldiers and thus into the gap Hannibal’s army had left. As more Romans poured forward, they became crammed into a smaller and smaller space until they couldn’t properly swing their weapons. The sides of the arc then circled behind the Romans, and the slaughter began. Over 50,000 Romans died that day, compared to Hannibal’s 5,000 or so losses. So what can we take away from this gruesome story? Hannibal carefully considered every single action in his strategy so that each one naturally followed the last. Thus his strategy won him a decisive victory in spite of the odds against him. The best strategies, such as Hannibal’s, recognize the trade-off between resources, possible actions, and the optimization of both. Like Hannibal, you should strive to ensure that your strategy utilizes your limited resources in the most efficient way possible. The world of business is one that is constantly changing; it’s lucrative to develop strategies that take advantage of these shifts, but how do you make it happen? In many cases, the biggest effects of changes will be so obvious that they can’t offer you any clear advantages. However, with these effects come many other opportunities if you look for the less obvious second-order effects. For example, when television first emerged, it was easy to anticipate that free TV would produce huge competition for movie theaters. Yet there were many second-order effects, which were much harder to predict. One involved the organization of Hollywood studios. In the past, these studios had a captive audience. But that audience disappeared with the advent of the television, so they had to make up for this lost revenue by taking up roles financing independent films that could draw specialist audiences to the cinema. Indie directors and writers therefore benefited from major studio funding to produce their specialist films, thus enjoying the hidden second-order effect of television’s introduction to the market. However, in some markets changes are relatively rare due to the prohibitive cost of improving the existing technologies. In these cases, you can create changes through innovation. For example, in the 1960s black and white photographic film had been improved upon to the point where investments in fresh research no longer provided a worthwhile return. This made it difficult for newer companies to challenge the Goliaths of the industry, such as Ilford in the UK and Ansco in the United States. However, a few smaller companies, such as Kodak and Fuji, did challenge these giants’ market share by developing color film, where the opportunities were far more plentiful. By further developing this new technology and making it more effective, these companies instigated a change in the market and managed to rise to the top. Now that you understand the nuts and bolts of a strategy, it's time to ask yourself how a strategy turns visions into realities. In most cases they do this by maximizing competitive advantage – namely the ability to produce more value at lower costs than competitors. So how can you engineer a strategy that accomplishes this? One way is to use isolation mechanisms, which give you a competitive advantage in an area by limiting your competitors’ opportunities. For example, Apple’s iPhone is protected by many isolation mechanisms working in concert: the brand name, the company’s reputation, and then the complementary iTunes service with its huge media database. These factors make it difficult for competitors to create rival products; not only are they competing with that product, but also with its marketing, its comprehensive operating system and its image. Apple has so effectively cornered its market that the only opportunity for a competitor to enter would be to sell a comparable product at a lower price, which is certainly no small feat. Another way to achieve competitive advantage is by creating a higher demand for any of the resources you have at your disposal. One example of this is the marketing methods of the POM Wonderful pomegranate juice company. While pomegranates were originally only a minor crop in their orchards, the owners realized that they made more money per acre from pomegranates than from other crops. They then invested in research, discovering previously unknown health benefits from pomegranates, and bought 6,000 acres for cultivating pomegranates, thus increasing US pomegranate production capacity six fold. They then starting selling their pomegranate juice as a fresh fruit drink, emphasizing its many health benefits. And because they were now the largest producer of pomegranates, they were able to reap all the rewards of the high demand that they had created, without having to share with other manufacturers or competitors! Now that you’ve learned how to successfully implement your strategies, the following blinks will reveal how to become a great strategist. So you now know about the components of a good strategy and how they can and have been used in real-life scenarios, but how can you become an effective strategist? You must first start making strategic hypotheses – educated estimations of how a given situation works or could work, which help when you contemplate your strategy. As an example, consider this hypothesis, developed by Howard Schultz after a visit to Italy in 1983: “The Italian espresso experience could be re-created in America and the public would embrace it.” Schultz was awed by the grace and flair of Italian coffee bars, where expensive coffee was served in a relaxed social setting, and struck by the contrast to the coffee culture in America, where the mass market was comprised of cheap, bland coffee. Having developed his hypothesis he decided to test it by convincing his employers at a roasting company in Seattle to give him space to set up a small espresso bar. That company was Starbucks. Like Schultz, you too should test your hypothesis to gather new information, and form new hypotheses based on those results. Schultz started by copying the Italian original, but he soon noticed that Americans preferred lounging in chairs to standing at the bar, so he introduced chairs and tables. He then discovered that many American customers wanted their coffee to go, so he introduced paper cups. What can we learn from his success? He tested his hypothesis, which was recreating the Italian espresso experience – but needed to modify it for American preferences in order for them to truly embrace it. His company then purchased Starbucks’ retail and trademark in 1987, and by 2001 brought in $2.6 billion in revenue. Indeed, strategy is much like a science: we must come up with a possible explanation, or working hypothesis, and constantly refine it. Statistically, you’re five times more likely to have a car accident if you’re talking on a cell phone while driving – roughly the same as if you’re drunk. However, though many people are aware of this fact, when faced with a decision they tend to think: “It won’t happen to me, I am a good driver.” This phenomenon is called the inside view – the tendency to ignore lessons others have learned in a similar situation and to believe that our specific situation is somehow different. Many of us follow the inside view, and so often the results are fatal. The 2008 financial crisis is a perfect example. In the years preceding the crisis, it was widely believed that the economic histories of other nations were no longer relevant to modern America, and many thought that the Federal Reserve’s expertise had finally eliminated economic booms and busts entirely. This inside-view thinking caused people to ignore problems within the system, which then led to the greatest financial crisis in half a century. In order to avoid this disastrous way of thinking, we should seek to gain perspective by closely scrutinizing a situation from the outside view. A good strategy does this by asking: Why have other people in a similar situation to mine succeeded or failed? In addition, a good strategy recognizes that in the vast majority of cases, our situation is far less unique than we might imagine. The 2008 financial crisis could have been avoided if analysts had looked at financial history with an outside view, and realized that crises always happen. Similarly, how many accidents do you think could have been avoided if people looked at the statistics with an outside view? Good strategies benefit from paying close attention to other people’s experiences and the lessons they’ve gained from those experiences. The key message in this book: Luckily we can all learn how to become good strategists. By understanding what makes a solid strategy and by finding the hidden power of a given situation, be it leveraging, maximizing your resources or anticipating change, you too can become an effective strategist. Actionable advice: Get your priorities straight. Trying to accomplish all your goals at once makes for an ineffective strategy. Instead, make a list with the most important things that you can work on and start with them first. By producing this list, you ensure that your various objectives have unity in direction, and can then clear up conflicting issues. Take lessons from the past. If you find yourself in a situation that other people have experienced previously, pay close attention to how it turned out for them. Try to look at your own situation objectively rather than assuming that it’s somehow different to what happened in the past. Think like a scientist. If you feel uncertain about what the deciding factors in a situation are, form a hypothesis and test it out. This test will offer you insight into which areas need to be readjusted, thus helping you move closer to a solid understanding of your situation that you can use to build an effective strategy.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

Grove","summary":"Management seems like an overwhelming task. Managers are expected to be everywhere at every time, to listen and speak to their staff, to plan and organize workflows, to bring the best out of their employees and enhance overall performance. But how can one person master so many tasks? In these blinks, you’ll find out what the key responsibilities of a manager are and what you need to know about your employees and your role. You will learn how to collect the information you need to make the right decisions, how to motivate your team and how to make them perform well. You’ll also learn what management has to do with serving breakfast; how to find out quickly whether an employee lacks skill or motivation; and why managers may take a leaf out of a sports coach’s playbook. It might seem an odd idea, but working as a waiter will perfectly prepare you to manage the production processes of a company. How come? Well, managing production processes is actually just like serving breakfast. For instance, if your job is to deliver a three-minute boiled egg, toast and coffee, you’re already facing the essential requirements of production. You need to respond to demand by delivering your product according to a given schedule while meeting expectations for quality and keeping down costs. To succeed at this complicated series of tasks you need to keep the first question of production in mind: which step is the hardest to complete? When it comes to serving breakfast, it’s definitely boiling the egg as it takes the longest time. All the remaining steps should be planned around the time needed to accomplish this task. Then, once you’ve identified the priority step in production, it’s your job as a manager to find the most cost-effective way to use the resources at your disposal. Imagine a waiter has to stand in line every morning to use the toaster while his customer waits for her breakfast. How can he resolve the problem? His options are to ask a coworker for help, prepare toast in advance or buy another toaster. Essentially, managers are there to identify and solve these kinds of bottlenecks, and their solutions include hiring a larger workforce, increasing inventory or buying more equipment. But remember, all of these choices cost money, and the task of a manager is to balance them in the most cost-effective way. But that’s not all; managers also need to detect problems. That’s because problems arise all the time in production; to control damage, it’s essential to find and fix them as early as possible. For example, if the kitchen ends up with a bunch of rotten eggs, it’d be better to find that out when they’re in the fridge and before they’re being boiled or tipped onto a customer’s plate. This means it’s essential for managers to monitor carefully all production processes. Naturally, a manager can’t be everywhere at once. To get a comprehensive overview, a manager needs to rely on good measurements. To do so, she should choose at least five indicators that are presented to her every morning upon arrival at work. First, she’ll want the sales forecasts right away. In other words, how many breakfasts will she have to make today? Second, the inventory levels are key. That’s because she needs to know how many eggs, loaves of bread and pounds of coffee she has in reserve. Third, she needs to know the condition of the equipment. Because if her only toaster called it quits yesterday, it’s essential to replace it before rush hour. Fourth, it’s important to have an update on the workforce. After all, if three waiters have called in sick, the manager needs to find substitutes right away. And finally, she’ll want a quality indicator that measures public opinion. Basically, did customers like the breakfast they were served? But having these production indicators isn’t enough; a manager also needs to know how to extract important information from them. One good strategy for this involves pairing two of them together. For instance, to better understand your inventory levels, you should check them against your sales forecasts to determine the potential for inventory shortages. This will help you decide what the critical inventory level is. You should also pair indicators with the actual results you’re achieving. For example, if you were evaluating a salesperson, you wouldn’t just consider the number of calls she made but also the number of deals she closed. You can also extract helpful information from indicators by examining trends. For instance, our manager can compare the number of breakfasts she served this month to previous months to assess her performance and make a prediction about whether she’ll serve more or less in the coming month. It might not always seem like it, but management is a team effort. This is why a manager isn’t just rated on their personal skills and individual performance, but also the working achievements of her team. For instance, if a manager does well at planning production, allocating resources and sniffing out mistakes, but her staff fails to execute, the manager is still responsible. So, how can you improve your team’s performance overall? Well, one of a manager’s key responsibilities when running a team is to collect and share information. Sometimes the best way to do that is through quick, informal conversations. After all, a few words shared between a manager and an employee at the coffee machine will spread a lot faster than any memo. However, asking for written reports from team members is also key. That’s because the discipline it takes to write a report makes the employee reflect on her work and better comprehend current issues. That makes reports essential for providing valuable information to a manager. But managers are also responsible for making decisions, which makes the previous responsibility of collecting and sharing information all the more essential. For example, it’s up to a manager to decide to open a new branch or hire new employees. To do so she’ll need detailed information on all the possible choices as well as their pros and cons. Finally, it’s also a manager’s job to be a role model. A manager who spends working time making personal calls is unlikely to motivate their team. On the other hand, a manager who puts in long hours and takes the work seriously will provide a great example for others to follow. Just remember, values can’t be communicated through memos and conversations alone. This means managers need to show the right way to behave. After all, nothing leads better than an example. Many managers consider meetings the curse of their existence, and Peter Drucker, a leader in modern management, has even said that spending more than 25 percent of your time in meetings is a sign of poor organization. But nevertheless, meetings are essential to any manager’s daily routine. That’s because meetings are the foundation for all other managerial activities. For instance, you just learned about a manager’s core duties: gathering information, making decisions and serving as an example. Not one of these can be done well without holding meetings. So, you don’t need to be terrified if meetings are taking up half your day. They’re simply the necessary medium through which management works. That being said, there are different types of meetings. A mission-oriented meeting is meant to solve specific problems by arriving at a decision. These tend to be held spontaneously as an emergency arises, like a meeting called at the last minute to quickly deal with a huge product malfunction. Another kind of meeting is process-oriented. Here, information and opinions about less pressing matters are shared. These meetings rely on regularity to pay off. The most well-known form is a one-on-one meeting between a supervisor and her employee – an opportunity for them both to get informed. With inexperienced subordinates, this type of meeting should usually occur once a week, but its frequency also depends on the job area and how quickly conditions change. For example, you’ll need to hold them more often in a marketing environment, where the work pace is faster than in, say, a research department. Ideally, these one-on-ones last around an hour and occur in or near the employee’s workspace as their environment might be revealing. By looking at your employee’s desk you can tell whether he’s organized or if he suffers from frequent disruptions. Imagine an employee isn’t living up to expectations. Do you know how to quickly determine whether he lacks skills or just needs more motivation? Just ask yourself, “could he perform his task if his life depended on it?” If the answer is yes, then he’s probably struggling with low motivation. There’s no way you could play the violin beautifully without being a trained musician. But if you had to run 6 miles to flee a serial killer, you’d probably make it even if you weren’t in great shape. The fact is, employees who perform inefficiently usually lack skills or motivation. Therefore, it’s no surprise that motivation has become central to modern management, in large part due to the rise of knowledge workers whose main source of capital is information. After all, the quality of work performed by a manual laborer is easy to assess. That’s because if a poorly motivated bricklayer builds a crooked wall, the foreman will immediately notice and take corrective measures. But when it comes to knowledge workers, it’s hard to immediately tell if a task was done properly without being an expert in the field they’re operating in. That means it’s even more important to keep employees motivated to prevent these costly, tricky-to-spot errors. So, it’s up to a manager to motivate her employees. But motivation can only come from within, which means a manager’s job is to foster an environment that helps employees maintain their own motivation. To do so, a manager needs to know whether her employees are competence-driven or achievement-driven individuals. The former are motivated to expand their knowledge and skills. Think of a stellar musician who practices daily to improve his technique. Managers should encourage these employees to produce tangible results and deter them from focusing solely on self-improvement. The other type, achievement-driven employees, are driven by success. Employees like this should be put in a context where their objectives are ambitious enough that they flourish. Every worker expects to be rewarded for their professional commitments, and money is probably the most obvious reward. But is it the best? Well, up to a certain point, money is an incredible motivator, but it has its limits. For example, some people who are already rich see money only as a status symbol that shows the outside world how successful they are. Someone like this doesn’t really need additional income, so earning one, two or five million more won’t impact their motivation much. On the other hand even employees who depend on their salaries to support themselves find money’s motivational potential limited. That’s because money motivates people, but only until they achieve a decent standard of living where their basic needs are satisfied. After that, these employees will want more meaningful and relevant rewards. So, how can you keep employees at peak performance? By setting up a system that gauges their success. In fact, this is the only way for workers to make real progress. Just look at the competence-driven employees who love to expand their knowledge and skills. The best tactic for motivating them is to show them that they still have potential to improve. Because without this potential, the desire to do better all but disappears. To demonstrate the space for improvement, a manager can provide evaluations and feedback through, for instance, performance reviews that rate an employee on his achievements. But remember, when reviewing performance, it’s essential for a manager to know how a fear of failure can turn certain achievement-driven people into overly cautious underperformers. It’s crucial to communicate the importance of accepting failure and supporting such employees whenever they need it. Maybe you’ve come across people in your office who are slow workers and show little motivation, but can still push themselves to the limit to run a full marathon. What motivates people like this? Simply put, the desire to beat others. That’s because, when in competition, people are much more likely to take on challenges. This drive to beat the distance, stopwatch or competition is a result of self-actualization, an idea brought to prominence by the psychologist Abraham Maslow in 1954. A person who feels that she has the potential to master a challenge will also be compelled to take it on. She will feel this compulsion because of a need to attain her own potential – actualize herself – through the challenge. It’s no surprise, therefore, that the best environment for self-actualization is competitive sports. So, what does this mean for a manager? That you have to bring the sporting spirit of competition into the workplace, and that means letting employees compare themselves to their coworkers. For instance, the maintenance service that cleaned Intel’s facilities performed poorly for years until a program was created to put the teams from each building into competition with one another by rating their work and comparing the scores. Though there were no further incentives than the desire to beat the others, the cleanliness of every building improved dramatically, proving that competition alone can increase performance. In some respects, a good manager should act as if she were the coach of a sports team. For example, a coach never takes credit for the team’s success, and neither should a manager, because it might make her team feel cheated out of their well-deserved congratulations. Coaches also sometimes need to be tough on their players to force the best performance out of them. Similarly, managers need to know how to give employees constructive criticism. You might be wondering, is there one approach to management that trumps all others? Probably not. That’s because management styles are prone to shifts and no perfect style has yet emerged. For instance, in the early twentieth century, management was harsh and strictly hierarchical. Employees followed orders and didn’t question their superiors. Management theory then very slowly evolved into a more gentle approach that took the individual employee into consideration instead of just his productivity. But despite this transformation, researchers of motivation and leadership have never settled on one optimal style. However, for any given situation, researchers can point to a variable that indicates which approach should be relied on. This style of assessing your subordinates is called task-relevant maturity, or TRM. It’s a combination of an employee’s tendencies toward responsibility and achievement, as well as her education, training and experience. As a result, a worker’s TRM might be higher for one task or field and low for another. For instance, a sales manager’s TRM could be high for sales but low when she’s managing a production process. Asking her to do the latter would be a little like forcing a person who’s used to navigating on small country roads to all of a sudden drive on a major freeway. So, TRM levels can vary, and different management styles are required according to an employee’s ranking. For instance, if an employee has a low TRM for a certain task, a manager should lay out the process in clear, detailed instructions. Then, as the employee’s TRM increases, the manager can reduce her involvement while still monitoring progress. In this way, the manager–employee relationship mimics that between a parent and child. As a child ages, parenting style shifts. After all, a toddler needs to be told not to touch dangerous objects, but there’s no need to explain to a teenager why she shouldn’t touch the blade of a sharp knife. And the same goes for your employees. As they grow, they’ll learn for themselves how to best succeed. The key message in this book: The responsibilities of a manager are multi-faceted and the changing nature of work has transformed the role. This means modern managers are responsible for gathering information, making decisions, acting as role models, fostering motivation and flexibly assessing their employees.  Actionable advice: Decide whether being friends with your subordinates is right for you.  People often wonder whether it’s OK to form a friendship with people who work under them. That’s because such relationships can be difficult to maintain, especially when the higher-up has to take disciplinary action against her subordinate. So, as a manager you want to be clear where you stand on this issue. Simply imagine giving a critical performance review to an already close friend. If you can do that, then forming personal ties might make sense and could be used to strengthen your professional relationships. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Sadly, professional women still experience challenges that their male counterparts don’t. While men are praised for taking risks and asserting themselves, women are held to a different standard. They’re rewarded for being nice and helping others – qualities associated with supporting roles, rather than leadership roles. Many women have adapted to these challenges by developing bad habits in an effort to prove their worth. By understanding and identifying your own unconscious learned behaviors, you can eliminate the unhelpful traits that are holding you back at work. In these blinks, you’ll learn why becoming an expert can be a bad career move; how unfair expectations follow women from school to the workplace; and that taking up more than one chair is a clever career move. Several years ago, one of the authors, Sally Helgesen, decided to interview successful professional women. Her aim was to find out what these women saw in the behavior of their younger colleagues that could be holding them back. The verdict was unanimous – the younger women all struggled with the word “I.” Reluctance to take credit for personal achievements is a common problem among professional women. When the author discussed the topic with women with senior positions in accounting, consulting and law, they all agreed that younger female employees in their firm were conscientious, consistent and delivered work of a very high standard. It was even noted that they often worked harder than their male counterparts. Their weakness didn’t lie in the quality of the work – it lay in their discomfort with drawing attention to their successes and taking credit for their accomplishments. For instance, they would underplay their own role in a team’s success, preferring to spread credit around than to acknowledge their hard work in front of senior colleagues. This is a problem that the author has observed in the numerous workshops she’s conducted with diverse groups of professional women, and it’s evident in nearly every industry at every level in the workplace hierarchy. Although seen as polite, being overly modest is more likely to harm a woman’s career than advance it. Over the course of their careers, both the authors have observed how men tend to distrust women who are self-deprecating about their achievements, considering them inauthentic. If a woman demonstrates this tendency in a management role, she also risks diminishing the accomplishments of the team she leads. As a manager, any failure to claim credit on behalf of the people she represents is a failure to acknowledge their hard work. By not recognizing the efforts of her team, she will end up demoralizing and being resented by her staff. Nobody’s perfect. So why do so many people still strive for perfection? Why do they feel the need to be pleasant, thoughtful and make others feel good at all times? Such behavior is known as the “disease to please,” and it’s particularly common among women. Women have been conditioned to please everyone around them, both at home and in public, while men are not taught to put others first. It’s a form of socialization that starts in childhood. Research has found that, from a young age, girls are more likely to receive praise from parents and teachers for deferring to others. They’re encouraged to be obedient, helpful and agreeable. Simply, they are more likely than boys to be rewarded for being pleasant. And this doesn’t end once they leave home or school. Working environments foster this need to please in women. For instance, businesses often employ women in entry- and mid-level roles with a focus on assisting others – roles in which their success depends on their ability to fulfill the needs of others, where being assertive is not seen as an asset. While often sold as a positive attribute, an excessive desire to please others holds women back. Women who have a need to please fear letting people down. They fear making others unhappy, even temporarily. For instance, many professional women feel unable to say no to jobs or tasks others ask them to take on, even though undertaking these activities won’t bring them any benefit. Why? Because they know it will displease the asker. This mindset robs women of their capacity to exercise authority, as they’re too scared of upsetting others by doing so. This is particularly unhelpful for women in positions of leadership, where their performance is evaluated according to their ability to assert authority. Even further down the career ladder, women in non-leadership positions are held back by the pleasing disease. So, if you want to be successful, don’t let your desire to please others get in the way of your ability to be direct and decisive. What’s the surest strategy for success? You might think it has something to do with putting in extra hours to master all facets of your job. But in reality, developing expertise within your current role won’t help you progress. In fact, it will keep you on the lower rungs of the career ladder. It’s common for female professionals to feel the need to go above and beyond to be taken seriously at work. If you’re a woman working in a traditionally male-dominated industry, chances are from the moment you arrived you felt under pressure to prove your competence. Perhaps a male colleague was reluctant to have a woman on his team and you tried to gain his respect by becoming a super contributor. Many women have internalized this attitude – the fear that they don’t really deserve to be in their position – and see developing excessive expertise as a means to prove they’re worthy. For instance, one professional woman working in software development reported that previous sexist comments led her to focus excessively on detail, rather than the big picture when she landed her first position. Keen to prove that she deserved her job, she concentrated on outperforming on any assignment she was given and made a name for herself as the team’s most reliable hard-grafter. However, if you have your eyes on promotion, developing so much expertise isn’t a good way to position yourself for a step up. Why? Because spending so much time and effort on small details leaves you with less time to nurture your workplace relationships. For instance, the aforementioned software engineer found that, as she progressed in her career, the ability to forge meaningful connections with the company’s clients was viewed as a far more valuable skill than the ability to keep her head down and churn out perfect engineering work at her desk. Furthermore, as a professional woman, you need to show that you’re the perfect fit for the role you aspire to, not for the role you’re currently in. If you become an expert in your current role, your boss will come to see you as indispensable and make an effort to keep you where you are. Several years ago, the author attended a board meeting of a national women’s group. As the board members arrived, she observed how the men in the room who were already seated made no attempt to move when newcomers entered looking for a place to sit. The women, on the other hand, responded to each newcomer by moving to take up less space around the table. Why, she asked herself, were the women trying to make themselves smaller? Unconsciously, women tend to minimize their presence and make themselves physically smaller in professional environments. This can be seen in the way they cross their legs, press their arms to the sides of their bodies, and keep their belongings close and neatly arranged. In contrast, men spread out as far as possible. They put their arms over the seats next to them, sit with their legs spread and their belongings scattered about. A woman’s tendency to minimize herself doesn’t just manifest itself physically but verbally, too. A study by Harvard Business School discovered that women are more likely to use phrases that suggest uncertainty, such as, “This might not be important, but…” Such verbal and physical minimizing behaviors can hold women back. Neuroscientists have conducted research that found that by drawing our limbs towards us and shrinking ourselves, we undermine any attempt to communicate power and authority. Making ourselves smaller is a submissive behavior. Just think of how a dog tucks its tail under when submitting to a more dominant dog. Further research shows that business leaders and others in positions of power interpret such signs of uncertainty as a lack of commitment. You can see how, without thinking, you may be projecting a timid, uncommitted image at work. Counter this by actively taking up space and not being afraid to say what you mean. Do you ever find yourself dwelling on past mistakes? Do you find it hard to move on mentally, even though an event is behind you? Maybe you’re constantly mulling over what went wrong, what you could have done differently or imagining how things might have been. If these thought patterns sound familiar, there’s a high chance you’re a woman. Routinely dwelling on mistakes and regrets is known as rumination, and it’s a classic female tendency. While both sexes are equally likely to fixate on negative events in their past, men tend to deal with these thoughts by blaming others for perceived failures and excusing themselves from responsibility. By turning their regret outward, men express this feeling as anger. According to research, this is the emotion men are most comfortable expressing. Women, on the other hand, are much more likely to blame themselves for mistakes. Psychological research suggests that women are more likely to believe they are at fault for anything that goes wrong and stress over minor errors. When regret is directed inward, it becomes rumination. Excessive rumination can lead to devastating psychological consequences and is counterproductive for work. This has been demonstrated by psychological research, which identified chronic rumination as a direct cause of depression. In other words, thinking too much about past regrets can make you seriously depressed in the present. And this behavior can also hold you back when it comes to taking action to overcome whatever it was that led you to ruminate in the first place. When you’re so busy mulling things over, it drains the mental energy you need to think about actual solutions to your problems. So, when you find yourself dwelling on regrets, remember that analysis equals paralysis. Stop blaming yourself and just let go of the past. Are you a self-proclaimed perfectionist? We sell this as a positive attribute, but striving for perfection can be the very opposite. Julie Johnson is an executive professional coach. One of the most common problems she sees in clients is the struggle to overcome perfectionism. After all, perfection is an unrealistic goal. When you inevitably fail to achieve it, you can’t help but feel stressed and disappointed in yourself. Another of Johnson’s significant findings is that – in her experience – perfectionism is an especially female problem, which has roots in childhood. From the moment of birth, gender expectations are imposed on children, and these expectations make women far more likely than men to grow up believing they must be perfect to be of value. Just think about how different sexes are rewarded. Girls are praised for obedience and academic achievement, whereas boys are given freedom. A “naughty boy” is seen as charming and entertaining, but girls who break the rules are penalized. For instance, at school, girls are much more likely than boys to be punished for aggressive behavior and acting out. In order to gain approval, girls are encouraged to do everything by the book, to avoid making mistakes and to be extra diligent. That’s where the female quest for perfection begins. Even as adults in the workplace, women are subject to society’s expectation that they should be perfect. This has devastating consequences for their careers. There is even research to back this up. Carlos Marin, a successful executive coach, has analyzed coaching data along with the results of numerous psychology surveys done by professionals. He found that men at the executive level were more likely to be rewarded for behavior that displayed a willingness to take risks. In contrast, female executives were rewarded for their precision and accuracy. Fear of making even small mistakes holds women back from taking risks. Unfortunately, taking risks is necessary to reach CEO level, as it’s this quality that allows a business to grow and evolve. Women are effectively creating their own glass ceiling by being perfectionists. If women are to rise through the ranks, they must ditch the heavy burden of perfection that’s been placed on them by society. In order to rise to the top of their chosen profession, women must stop attempting to be perfect, quit trying to please everyone all the time and stop dwelling on their past mistakes. By developing the confidence to take up more physical space, making the right social connections at work and owning their own accomplishments, women can meet their full potentials.  Actionable advice: Talk less to get ahead. It's proven that women tend to talk more than men do. In fact, research has found that the average woman speaks 20,000 words per day, whereas men speak just 7,000. While the female gift of gab is highly useful for building close relationships, it can be a hindrance in a male-dominated or corporate workplace. In these contexts, the typical male qualities of succinctness and concision are associated with authority and professionalism. Therefore, to excel in these environments, women should practice paring their communications down to the minimum and considering in advance the precise message they want to get across. Got feedback?

Dutton and Gretchen M. Spreitzer","summary":"How to Be a Positive Leader can rightly be called the bible of positive organizational scholarship, which gives us an understanding of how organizations can flourish and deliver high performance. These blinks outline the latest and most exciting research findings from this very young and constantly evolving field, and translate them into solid recommendations for good business practice. In these blinks, you’ll discover how you can successfully negotiate the salary you want even from a boss you despise; the secret to having a motivating job; and why you should keep a gratitude journal. By nature, we humans are social animals: we blossom when we have lots of positive interactions with our friends, family members, colleagues, and so forth. And when we are confident, we’re at our most creative and energetic. Specifically, we thrive when we have lots of high-quality connections: interactions where both participants’ energy levels are increased. An example of a high-quality connection would be if you’re feeling tired in the morning and have a chat with a colleague about something that energizes you and makes you feel alive – like the football game last night. Barbara Fredrickson, one of the pioneers of the positive psychology movement, considers high-quality connections a prerequisite for people to grow and thrive both personally and professionally. For organizations, a creative and energetic staff translates into a real competitive advantage, so companies need to do all they can to foster these interactions. Research shows that employees with many high-quality connections are more creative and motivated to learn new things, both of which are important for companies trying to come up with innovative schemes. So how can company leaders encourage high-quality connections between their staff? There are two main strategies to follow. First, when interacting with employees, leaders need to demonstrate that they respect and value them. In practice, this means paying close attention to what they say and being positive when they voice their opinions. One concrete gesture is to turn off your phone and move away from your computer to show that you’re giving the employee your full and complete attention. Second, leaders can facilitate teamwork and positive interactions by encouraging employees to play more games. This could mean organizing a team-building activity like orienteering, or having equipment like ping-pong tables, chessboards and basketball hoops at your workplace. What do you enjoy most about your work? Is it the pay? The office décor? Or something more profound? It should be the latter. Both employees and organizations benefit when their work is perceived to be meaningful. Meaningful work has a positive outcome for other people outside the company, for example, by making them feel happy or fulfilled, or improving their quality of life. This type of work greatly increases the intrinsic motivation of an employee. This was illustrated by a study of student employees at a University of Michigan call center, tasked with calling alumni to ask for donations. At the start of the study, the call center employees met a former student who had gotten his scholarship thanks to the funds raised by the call center. Suddenly, the call center employees’ work seemed more meaningful, and the subsequent increase in motivation was demonstrated by the substantial increase in revenue generated by each employee. The call center study illustrates perfectly why it’s important to let employees see the impact of their work. In a corporate setting, this often means connecting to the end users of a company’s products. For example, the medical technology company Medtronic throws a party every year and invites six patients, whose lives have been transformed by the company’s products, to tell their stories. This way, even the company’s engineers and salespeople get to hear about the true impact of their work. And this doesn’t just apply to employees. At IBM, the CEO insisted that the top 50 senior executives visit at least five of the company’s biggest customers in a three-month window, so they too could see the impact of their work. If it’s not possible for employees to connect directly with the end users of the company’s products, leaders should encourage them to share stories where they felt they made positive impacts. For example, at the investment bank Merrill Lynch, teams start their weekly meetings by sharing and discussing stories about helping customers. Life is full of negotiations. Whether it’s with our significant others, friends, colleagues or a traffic cop who wants to write us a ticket, we face negotiations every day. In the professional realm it’s particularly important to master the art of negotiating, because it can have a significant impact on your career. Most people get emotional when they negotiate: we’re angered when our wishes are ignored and feel happy when we get what we ask for. These emotions can either help or hinder a successful negotiation, which is why it’s crucial to be able to manage them. This is where mindful negotiation comes in. Mindful negotiation means being fully present, so that your thoughts don’t wander into the past or the future. This allows you to avoid emotionally stimulating thoughts, so you can focus on the task at hand. Say you’re negotiating about salary with your boss, whom you despise due to some past unpleasantness. If you let yourself drift into these hostile feelings, you’ll become overly emotional in the negotiation, and probably won’t get what you want. But if you negotiate mindfully, you’ll be able to focus solely on communicating why you deserve the salary you’re asking for, and not on what has happened in the past. You’ll be far more likely to succeed. The key to negotiating mindfully is keeping your emotions toward others out of the equation. For example, if someone does something to upset you, don’t get angry, but instead try to understand what feelings drove them to it. This emotionally neutral perspective will help you negotiate with the colleague in question. When do you do your best work? For most people, the answer would be: “When I feel good about myself.” This is known as positive identity, and it helps people feel happier and more focused, which translates into better work. So what makes people feel good about themselves? One framework that explains positive identity is the GIVE model, which has four elements. Growth: people tend to feel better about themselves when they sense they’re growing – for example, by learning new skills. They feel like they are becoming the person they’d ideally want to be. Integration: people who can make the different parts of their lives – like their work life, family and hobbies – fit together have a positive identity. Virtuousness: a natural complement to a positive identity. To consider themselves virtuous, people must feel that they have qualities like integrity and humility, and their actions facilitate this. For example, research indicates that when employees donate to their company’s employee support program, they tend to see themselves as more helpful, caring and benevolent. Esteem: people want to feel that their personality is appreciated by those around them. Leaders can also help employees enhance their positive identities by encouraging them to leverage their strengths and virtues at work. The reflected best-self exercise is a great tool to enable individuals to discover their character strengths and talents. The exercise starts with an employee gathering stories from, for example, friends and family about situations where they felt the employee was at her best. The employee then analyzes these stories to find common positive themes, thereby developing a portrait of their strengths, which can then be leveraged at work. If an employee finds one of his strengths is empathy, the company leader should try to create situations where this can be put to use – maybe something like asking him to mediate between other quarreling employees. Being able to constantly use good qualities like this helps people develop a positive identity. Can you think of a moment in your life when you felt particularly alive? These moments are known as thriving, and they are often characterized by a sense of learning, growth and overall vitality. Perhaps unsurprisingly, thriving has numerous benefits. Thriving employees tend to report higher levels of job satisfaction, creativity and courage. This is because they feel more confident in their abilities to achieve anything they put their minds to. Thriving employees also report fewer instance of burnout, because they enjoy their work more. They find it energizing and engaging: something that increases rather than depletes their energy reservoirs. Obviously, companies should help their employees to thrive. This can be done by providing a positive work environment. One key element to creating this is weeding out inappropriate, disrespectful and rude behavior. Danny Meyers, who owns 27 restaurants in New York City, has built his success on emphasizing civility in the workplace: If a chef behaves disrespectfully toward others, the chef needs to change his ways. Otherwise, he will be fired without any qualms. This zero-tolerance policy ensures a positive work environment. On an individual level, you can also help yourself thrive. There are two ways to tackle this. First, acquire new knowledge and expertise. A study of high-tech workers showed that people who seek out opportunities to get more informed – for instance, by asking for feedback – tended to be more energized and confident than others. Second, you need to ensure that you get enough rest and exercise. Scientific evidence shows that by engaging in cardiovascular or strength training, you can improve your mood during the work day. But it’s also important to get enough rest or it’ll be hard to stay positive, so you should aim for at least seven to eight hours of sleep every night. In many workplaces, every employee is treated pretty much the same, whatever their background. But because we’re all different and unique, it’s companies who let their employees craft their own jobs who tend to get the most out of their staff. Job crafting is when an employee adjusts and personalizes their role in a company to fit their passions, values and skills. For example, an executive who’s passionate about helping others reach their full potential might decide to craft her job so it revolves around coaching employees in their professional and personal lives. Or a marketing manager who’s particularly interested in social media advertising might decide to add a social media campaign to a product launch she’s working on. Job crafting benefits not only the employees, but also the company: studies show employees who craft their jobs are absent less, perform significantly better and are more proactive than others. So how does job crafting happen? It’s a flexible concept that can operate at different levels, both openly and personally. First, you can craft your job according to your strengths, values and interests. If you’re a salesperson interested in blogging, why not start a company blog that aims to acquire new customers? Second, you can adjust your job so that you spend time mostly with people you like, minimizing interaction with those you don’t. If you don’t get along with your boss, you can try to find ways to deliver high-quality job performance without having to interact with him by, say, shifting your communication toward emails. Some people think that for an employee to be successful in the corporate world, they need to be ruthless and highly driven. But in fact one of the most important characteristics of a great employee is virtuousness – a quality often ignored by companies. Virtues like gratitude, honesty, love and forgiveness have many benefits for both employees and organizations. For individuals, the main benefit of virtuousness lies in its inherent worth: people feel good about themselves when they do something virtuous, like helping someone else. This makes them happier, more committed and more productive, all of which benefits the company in turn. So how can virtuousness at work be increased? One of the easiest virtues to encourage is gratitude. Studies have shown it brings substantial benefits like improved physical health, social relationships and cognitive performance. Gratitude can be fostered by, for example, asking employees to keep a gratitude journal, where they note down everything for which they are grateful, both at work and at home. Another virtue to be fostered is transcendence, which refers to a sense of profound purpose. It can be encouraged by setting goals that contribute to society. This is what Apple did in the 1980s by defining its goal as “One person, one computer.” It wanted every person on the planet to be able to experience the joy and efficacy that comes from owning a computer, and this motivated employees to strive for this goal. What did Nelson Mandela, Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King all have in common? They were ethical leaders: they treated others in a just, caring and respectful way. What’s more, they also tried to ensure their followers did so too. In business, ethical leaders tend to have a positive impact on their staff. Studies show that employees who consider their leaders to be ethical are more satisfied with their jobs and tend to perform better. One possible explanation is that ethical leadership enhances employees’ sense that their work is meaningful and “good.” What’s more, employees with ethical leaders are far less likely to engage in unethical behavior like discrimination, and this further adds to the positive work environment. But why is the leader so important here? It could come down to the fundamental human norm of reciprocity: when employees are treated well by their leaders, they reciprocate by treating others well too. Another potential explanation is that employees see their ethical leaders as role models whose good behavior they wish to emulate. Whatever the reason, it’s important for you to work on improving your ethical leadership. One way to do this is to include ethical considerations in business discussions and then act on them. For example, you may find yourself with an opportunity to conduct business in a way that is not technically illegal, but raises ethical concerns, like selling military technology to a manufacturer which counts brutal regimes among its best customers. An ethical leader would refuse. You must also clarify your own values for yourself and keep them in mind constantly. If you’re facing a difficult decision, ask yourself if you would be comfortable with the consequences of your decision being published on the front page of the New York Times. If not, then it’s probably not in line with your values, and you should reconsider. The value of ethical leadership is likely to grow further in the future, as consumers become better informed and increasingly critical. In the previous blinks, we’ve examined many factors that can help employees excel at what they do. But by far the most important prerequisite for human excellence is hope: a deep belief that both people and situations can change for the better. Hope influences your emotions, thoughts and actions. When you’re hopeful, you feel more capable of reaching goals, and this in turn translates into confidence and action. Some great leaders have focused on instilling hope in others. For example, Nelson Mandela fought for human rights improvements primarily by raising hopes for a better future in others, even though he himself had to suffer for it. There are many ways to cultivate hope. One effective method is to act as if your desired goals were feasible, no matter how unrealistic they seem. Taking that first step is crucial – if you never try, you’ll certainly never succeed. Consider Ray Anderson, founder of Interface Inc., a carpet company worth $1.1 billion. In 1994, he declared he would totally eliminate any negative impact his company had on the environment. This seemed ludicrously naive at the time, but nevertheless he took action as if the goal was totally achievable. The result? By 2009, he was already halfway there. Hope is especially important when times are bad, so it must be fostered and cultivated. Amid the gloom of post-genocide Rwanda in 2005, one local called Odile Katese decided that life should not just be about struggling. She wanted to redirect people’s attention into something that would bond them together and bring hope and joy to others. So she founded a women’s drum group, which became so successful that it rapidly achieved world-wide fame. Clearly, people had been craving hope. Considering how omnipresent change is in life, it’s astonishing how bad we are at managing it effectively. This is especially true in organizations, where change often results in confusion and clashes between employees and leaders. Why is this? Partly it’s due to leaders seeing employees as a constant source of change resistance. Whether they’re trying to implement a new IT system or a revised product strategy, they can even feel as if the employees are out to sabotage the move. This frustrates leaders so much that sometimes they might go as far as to take unilateral action without communicating with their employees at all. Of course, when the employees see this, they feel they’re being ignored, which makes them more resistant. It’s a vicious cycle, and instead of being sucked into it, leaders should try not to be distracted by the inevitable handful of change-resistant employees, and instead focus on turning the other employees into resources that fuel the firm’s growth. There are a few best practices to help achieve this. The first is to foster a sense of ownership and freedom to experiment in employees. This way leaders can help the change by tapping into a vast pool of employee ideas. As an example of employee innovation, consider the story of Ethan, a manager working in a women’s clothing store. When he discovered that a particular dress wasn’t selling well, he decided to cut off the straps and sell it as a beach cover up. This bold, independent action resulted in the item becoming a best seller. A second method is to help employees understand the hidden benefits of a change. Ask specific questions like, “What skills will you build during this change?” “What new relationships might you be able to forge?” and “How will you grow as a person?” But beware: this can be difficult, as it’s basic human psychology to focus more on what’s lost with the old way of doing things than on what can be gained from the new. The key message in this book: Organizations today could get far more out of their staff if leaders knew how to take into account the human elements of leadership, like emotions. This would not only help companies get a real competitive advantage through a more productive workforce, it would also make employees feel happier and more fulfilled. Actionable advice: Give someone your full attention. The next time you talk to somebody, make a conscious effort to show them your appreciation by giving them your full attention: move away from your computer, put away your smartphone and close the book in front of you. Listen intently only to the person in front of you.

It’s crushing just to think about, right? That’s why in the history of obscene crimes, Ponzi schemes have to rank near the top. What kind of soulless psychopath steals people’s hard-earned money by the billions, while smiling right to their faces? It’s hard to think of all the people who lost everything they had worked so hard to save up, but they were up against truly terrifying forces. People like Bernie Madoff and Allen Stanford were incredibly sneaky and clever about how they won clients’ trust; and they were so ruthless they even bankrupted charities and community organizations. That’s why these blinks focus on knowing how to protect your investments, spotting these kinds of conmen, and ensuring your hard-earned money is safe. In these blinks, you’ll learn the telltale signs of a con; why fraudster Allen Stanford hired anti-fraud lobbyists; and why the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission won’t save you from being had. From celebrities like Steven Spielberg to charities like the Elie Wiesel Foundation, many people entrusted their money to investment specialist Bernard Madoff. Yet, in 2008 Madoff was revealed as a fraud who had swindled his clients out of a whopping $65 billion. How can you avoid a similar fate? There is a common thread across investment fraud: a financial adviser has been given control of the assets. So whenever you do any type of investing, don’t place your money and assets into just anybody’s hands. Instead, employ a custodian, i.e., a financial institution that safeguards your securities (either physically or electronically), and keeps you informed about your accounts. Custodians minimize the risk that your money will be stolen or squandered, as they act as a buffer between your money and the financial adviser, and have neither access to your accounts and investment profits, nor do they win a commission when you buy certain stocks. They ensure that none of your money mysteriously disappears, bar third parties from withdrawing your money without your express consent, and verify every investment and transaction. With a custodian, you can access your accounts online 24/7, and they also provide their own account statements, which you can cross-check with those your investment adviser provides. But if your custodian is also the person who makes your investment decisions, you’re in trouble. Usually, your financial manager can trade on your behalf, but can’t remove your money from your account because he is not your custodian. But if you give your financial adviser custody of your funds and allow him to invest them directly – if he is unscrupulous – then you’ve unwittingly enabled him to line his own pockets with your money and then cover his tracks with false or misleading account statements. With no independent custodian’s statement with which to compare your statements, it’s easy for you to be scammed, and hard for you to do that math. You’re on your way to meet your money manager – nervous, because industries you’ve invested in are nosediving. However, at your meeting, your manager tells you that your portfolio is doing great. Is it time for a sigh of relief? Not necessarily. It could simply be the case that you’re being lied to. So how do you discern a great investor who can beat the market from a greedy rat who’s after your money? Keep a look out for these warning signs: If someone is promising you incredibly good returns: No one can honestly promise returns of 40 or 50 percent. The only people to have ever promised returns of that magnitude were master fraudsters like Nicholas Cosmo and Charles Ponzi.Of course, it’s entirely possible that an adviser has gigantic annual returns once or twice in his career, but there is no secret formula to beating the market by such an extreme margin, year after year. Equally suspicious are consistent above-average track records. Most markets are volatile – they jump up and fall down a lot. Simply put: consistent returns aren’t normal. In fact, according to Global Financial Data, extreme returns are the norm: Two thirds of all S&P 500 annual returns since 1926 were either below zero or above 20 percent, with one third being “average,” i.e., between zero and 20 percent. Just think of the market downturn from 2000 to 2003 or the 2008 recession, when global stocks were down 41 percent. It’s extremely unlikely that anyone would perform the same in 2008 as in other years! Moreover, all great money managers have their bad years. When the author compared the performance of legendary investors like Warren Buffet, he found that even they got it wrong around 30 percent of the time. “Try our new, time-tested money making strategy today! We’re arbitraging away proprietary options and employing a split-strike conversion to insure your investment!” Could you understand any of that? No one can. Yet, this is often what investment jargon sounds like to the inexperienced. However, you should never invest in a strategy that you don’t understand. Doing so would be like buying a painting in a pitch-black basement. Just because someone says the paintings are nice doesn’t mean you’ll like them in the light. Also, you’re absolutely intelligent enough to understand any straightforward investment strategy as long as it is explained properly. So, if your financial adviser can’t or won’t explain it to you in plain English, then it’s time to sound the alarm.   This doesn't necessarily mean he’s trying to cheat you. It’s entirely possible that he doesn’t understand the strategy himself, doesn’t have time for you or is simply trying to impress you with intelligent-sounding investor-speak. All the same, these are bad signs. Furthermore, don’t buy into a set of flashy tactics as if it were a real strategy. Tactics aren’t strategies, but a set of tools. Strategy, on the other hand, is the plan that informs how you will be using those tools. If you want to build a wardrobe, you’ll need more than a box full of tools. You’ll also need a blueprint, otherwise you won’t know how to build it. An investment strategy is like your blueprint, while tactics, e.g., investing in options, are like a hammer. So, if your adviser tells you “we’re going to earn great returns by investing in derivatives,” he’s keeping you in the dark. Which derivatives? And where will the returns come from? He’s given you the tactics without the strategy. Typical scammers try to sell their victims a flashy-sounding tactic as if it were a strategy, such as Madoff, who promised to make lucrative returns by using “split-strike conversions.   Bernie Madoff advertised his funds as being “exclusive.” To invest with him, you first had to be introduced by a trusted source. Being accepted by Madoff must have felt being granted access to an elite social club – it most certainly didn’t feel like handing over all your money to a fraudster. Exclusivity itself doesn’t mean much. If an adviser claims to cater to an exclusive, elite group of clients, it could mean a number of things, but it could also just be a trick. Some people find things more desirable if they’re difficult to obtain. For them, having an exclusive adviser feels like a great achievement. But in their eagerness to “join the club,” they become less likely to question their adviser’s investment tactics. By itself, exclusivity isn’t a good reason to choose an adviser. It neither lowers fees nor improves long-term performance. However, there are legitimate reasons that an adviser would only take on certain investors. For instance, his strategy may be inefficient below a certain investment threshold (based on economies of scale). Flashy displays, too, shouldn’t inspire confidence, unless they benefit the investors. In the world of financial advisers, any expenditures are ultimately the client’s expense. Marble furnishings and a lion-skin rug could be a sign that your adviser isn’t dealing with client fees very efficiently. If extravagant expenditures are in fact in the client’s best interests, then your adviser should explain to you that plan. If he can’t, then the flashy displays and expensive toys could indicate that your adviser is distracted by opulence – either that or it’s an attempt to distract clients. Remember: A top financial expert doesn’t have time for expensive toys. Imagine you’ve met with your financial adviser for the first time, and he offers to manage your money for free. You get all his expertise and he gets nothing. Sounds like a great deal, right? Why should you leave his office only to have to seek out another adviser whom you’ll surely have to pay? The truth is, financial advisers don’t work for free. No matter what, your adviser is going to get paid. If you don’t pay him, then he’ll make money other ways, e.g., through product recommendations. This can represent a major conflict of interests – between your interest and the interests of those who are paying your adviser. Even worse, he could embezzle the money you’ve invested. Bernie Madoff, for example, didn’t charge an adviser’s fee, just transaction costs. Even if your financial manager isn’t a fraud like Madoff, he has a huge incentive to trade if transaction costs are the only way he gets paid, regardless of whether it’s in the investor’s best interests. Moreover, you can’t just tell a money manager’s trustworthiness from his reputation either. Anyone can earn – or buy – a good reputation, even charismatic fraudulent psychopaths. All it takes is a few donations here or there and then a loud mouth to make a big deal out of it. Indeed, charitable donations, whether to nonprofits, respectable political initiatives or the arts, make people look generous, respectable and committed to public welfare. Many a con man has used that tactic. Madoff himself donated more than $1 million to the Lymphoma Research Foundation in 2007, and fraudster Allen Stanford hired lobbyists to support the Financial Services Antifraud Network Act in 2002. Both these charitable deeds added to their reputability, but still they cheated their clients. When you’re searching for a place to get a good haircut, all you have to do is ask your stylish friend for a recommendation. But when it comes to financial advisers, your friends’ recommendations are suspect. In fact, it’s definitely not in your best interest to choose your financial adviser based solely on your friends’ recommendations. It takes time and care to select a trustworthy adviser, and there’s no guarantee your friends paid their due diligence. It’s very possible that they have no idea how to discern whether an adviser is any good. They could have even chosen their adviser based on a recommendation from their friend; who knows what their criteria are for trustworthy advisers! Moreover, con artists know that people tend to trust referrals from friends, and viciously exploit that tendency. Madoff, for instance, made a system out of it. He had “unofficial” agents who referred him to their friends – sometimes even receiving compensation for their referrals. Of course, your friend’s referral isn’t meaningless. You will just need to make sure that their adviser stands up to closer scrutiny. You should also resist the urge to trust advisers just because they belong to your peer group. We’re much more  likely to trust people who belong to our peer group – people who, for instance, belong to the same church, club or an alumni association – and this is especially so if it’s a tightly knit group. While the two of you may enjoy some solidarity, that’s not enough of a reason to put them in control of your finances. You can’t assume that someone is a more capable or trustworthy financial adviser just because he belongs to your tennis club! Fraudsters tend to exploit their affiliations and the default trust that comes with them. Bernie Madoff marketed heavily to his own Jewish community, bankrupting friends and charities along the way. Part of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) mission is to keep investors safe from fraud. But what exactly do they do? And why are there still so many rats out there? For one, the SEC ensures high standards of transparency for big-time advisers. All companies and individuals who receive compensation for their investment advice must register with the SEC if they manage at least $110 million worth of assets (unless they only manage hedge funds). The SEC mandates that investment advisers disclose all the material information that might interest investors in the Form ADV, essentially a questionnaire which asks for information like the money managers’ qualifications, past felony charges, compensation, etc. The SEC also schedules surprise inspections for all registered firms, looking for things like improbably high returns, and enforces securities laws. While the SEC does its best, it still fails to catch all the rats before it’s too late. The SEC rarely detects fraud ahead of time. They simply lack the resources necessary to monitor all registrants at all times. Moreover, a thorough inspection can take weeks, and it’s impossible to scrutinize every single document, meaning important information can be easily glossed over. Or the documents themselves could be filled with misleading data from the outset. For example, when legendary crook Allen Stanford registered his firm, he didn’t list himself as someone who directs investments (which he did), and instead listed himself as merely an indirect owner. That way, he wasn’t required to disclose suspicious information about his past, such as his past bankruptcy. While the SEC does a good job keeping tabs on degenerate firms, they can’t know everything. Ultimately, it’s up to you to diligently vet your financial advisers. The key message in this book: Crooked financial advisers employ many tactics to trick their clients into handing over the key to their fortunes. Luckily, if you know what to look for, you can avoid the pain and frustration of hiring a rat.

But while tinkering with Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, etc., only a few have noticed what social media is trying to teach us. That’s a shame, because social media can teach us everything we need to know about how to do business in the 21st century. The key is a new conception of what business means. Is it a giant machine-like apparatus, with a bunch of steel cranking out doohickeys on an assembly line? What if it more resembles us humans, fallible, curious, living things that we are? That’s the question that Humanize tries to answer. By looking at how some of the best businesses have succeeded in making their companies more human, these blinks hold a few important secrets not just for marketers, but for anyone who wants their business to reach more people. These blinks will show you why best practices should be thrown out; why good companies are courageous; and why one chain of grocery stores makes all its salaries visible to the other employees. Over the past few years, social media has become all-pervasive. And in the process, it has transformed the way we interact with each other. But social media hasn’t only changed our personal relationships, it’s also had a profound impact on the business world in several crucial ways. First of all, social media makes it harder for companies to control their brand images. Before the dawn of social media, companies managed their brands by developing a marketing strategy based on market research; if anything went wrong, businesses would rely on PR spokespeople to release slick statements. Today, however, companies have to contend with word-of-mouth marketing. Pretty much anyone with access to Facebook, Twitter, Yelp and other platforms can broadcast opinions about a brand. These platforms have not only minimized the control companies have over their brands, they’ve also transformed the processes businesses use to get their messages out. Earlier, when just a few forms of traditional media (newspapers, magazines, television) dominated broadcasting, all businesses had to do communicate with their customers was to place the right message on the right channel. But because of the emergence of real-time communication platforms like Twitter (which can report news much faster than traditional media outlets), traditional media is all but obsolete today. And finally, social media has impacted the business world in one more important respect: these new technologies have disrupted the way industries are structured. So in the past, trade organizations and other professional associations functioned by offering benefits such as education, networking and advocacy in exchange for regular dues. But now, people use social media to network online for free — which has lessened the influence of traditional organizations and irrevocably changed entire industries. Clearly, the emergence of social media requires businesses to find new ways to connect with customers, but have companies actually been doing so? Keep reading to find out. The truth is, many businesses haven’t been able to keep up with the times. Even amidst the social media revolution, plenty of companies continue to rely on the old best practices; that is, standardized techniques that were developed over many years, and reinforced through benchmarking. Although adhering to best practices has certain advantages, it can cause businesses to oversimplify the complexities of cause and effect. For example, strategic planning — one example of best practices that’s still used by many businesses—is all about coming up with a five-year plan to plot out the future. However, these plans tend to be abandoned quickly. Why? Well the truth is, reality unfolds in complicated, hard-to-predict ways — and this is especially the case in the social media age. Another drawback of best practices is that it leads businesses to compartmentalize their organizations into discrete parts — which can cause them to lose sight of how the system works as a whole. For example, consider human resource management, an established tenet of best practices. Most large companies organize their personnel into a hierarchy of departments headed by a management team. Employees are typically hired into particular departments, where they are expected to fulfill a specific job description. While division of labor can lead to more productivity, too much separation can create barriers that prevent departments from freely sharing information and ideas across the whole company. Which gets at another point: one big reason best practices are so detrimental is because they rigidly formalize business processes, thus discouraging open-ended and creative thinking. In other words, when was the last time you were excited about a strategic planning session? And how often do an interviewer’s formal, hackneyed questions allow you to express who you really are? That’s exactly the problem with best practices. They emphasize clarity and order over ambiguity, but ambiguity is a necessary condition for creative problem-solving and innovation. Here’s something that may surprise you: innovation and success are a matter of mindset. That is, you can make your business more compelling and efficient by changing the way you think and talk about your company. This principle doesn’t conform to our conventional ideas about business; after all, we tend to view companies as machines. Just look at the language we use: We run organizations, engineer our processes, manage our human resources and measure our outputs. These are all very mechanical terms. We also use similar language to describe business organization: divisions, teams, units — these terms have a technical feel. Additionally, consider that these organizational structures are based on discrete components playing specific roles within a larger system — just like cogs in a machine! These mechanical metaphors are all-pervasive in the business sphere — and for good reason! During the Industrial Revolution, machines altered human society in a profound way. And yet, a lot has changed in the past century. And today, this kind of language doesn’t adequately express the new social media age. That’s because social media is powered by the human: we express our personalities on the flickering pages of the Internet by sharing our interests, activities, opinions and desires. Recently, this more human aspect has been running up against the business world’s machine-inspired mindset. Consider that while offices operate only during business hours, social media is on 24/7. So how can businesses respond to news and scandals that develop around their brand over the weekend, or after hours? Ultimately, the business world needs to adjust. Social media isn’t going away, and the only way businesses can exist today is by becoming more “human” themselves. And although each company will have to find an individualized approach, there are four general goals leaders can use to humanize their organization: openness, trustworthiness, generativeness and courageousness. The following blinks will discuss more ways your business can adapt to the social media age. As we mentioned in the last blink, the first step of humanizing a company is to make it more open. That means decentralizing it and letting employees express their individuality. Why is this step so important? Well, in the social media era, centralized systems of control no longer ensure business success. Since today’s customers expect immediately feedback, it would simply take too long for every post, Tweet and email message to be approved by a central committee. But although companies need to be flexible, completely ceding all control isn’t the way forward. In fact, the most successful instances of decentralization strike a balance between openness and control by defining boundaries and then letting employees work within those limits at their own discretion. Although this isn’t explicitly connected to social media, a good example of this principle is Google’s 20 percent time rule, which allows employees to spend one day a week working on an independent project — even if it falls outside their job description. But it’s worth noting that when you’re promoting openness, it’s important to be as clear as possible about your vision for the company. This clarity will allow you to direct and focus your employees without necessarily controlling every single detail of their workday. But how can you clearly convey your vision for the company to your employees? The best way is to come up with a few key principles. For example, Nordstrom has just one rule for new employees: “Use your best judgement in all situations.” Since this rule is so short, it’s easy to memorize and implement at precisely the moment when a decision is needed. Basic principles like these allow the system to achieve unity and consistency, without leaving the employees with that lingering, stultifying feeling that they’re being controlled and told what to do. Overall, an open company culture goes together with a culture of trust. So how can your company build trusting relationships within the organization? Read on to find out! In the social media era, trust is paramount. Because how else can executives leave public relations in the hands of social media managers if they don’t trust them to do the right thing? So how can you create a culture of trust within your company? Well, the first step is introducing more transparency — something which is often hard for companies to embrace. Many businesses mistakenly view transparency as a threat; they think, do we really want all that information floating around, for everyone to see? And what if an employee unwittingly posts trade secrets? But companies should adjust their mindset. Sharing information doesn’t have to be dangerous; in fact, it can actually be a clever, strategic move. The view around sharing information can shift. Instead of viewing sharing as cause for concern, we can have the perspective that sharing information means other people in the system can produce results that are beneficial for everyone involved. For example, the grocery chain Whole Foods made the radical decision to internally disclose all its salary data to all employees. To the uninitiated, the idea that employees are able to look up each other’s salary might seem disastrous for morale — but the strategy works for Whole Foods. Why? Well, when an employee notices that a coworker is earning more, she can try to figure out what makes her coworker stand out, and then adjust her own performance accordingly. In this sense, disclosing salaries motivates employees to work harder and more effectively to earn promotions and raises. And this approach links back to our earlier discussion of open systems: transparency allows the right people to get access to the right information at the right time — without having to go through a centralized bureaucratic process. We’ve arrived at the third principle of humanizing a business — generativeness. Fair warning: this is a tough one. And yet, it’s crucial for anyone who wants to create new value, innovate, and improve both her company’s profits and also the whole world. So how do you start? Well, since innovation is fueled by diversity, the first step to achieving generativeness is to assemble a diverse body of employees. Employee diversity (using the term in its widest sense, to encompass identity, interests and talent) allows companies to bring together many different viewpoints and approaches, which creates the opportunity for unexpected, serendipitous ideas. Consider Florence during the Renaissance. The wealthy Medici family played an instrumental role in creating a culture of creative and innovation, by bringing together talented artists and scientists from all different backgrounds. So instead of seeing diversity as something that’s purely a public relations issue, try to create your company’s own version of the Florentine Renaissance. Because as we’ve seen, diversity isn’t just about making your company look good in the press; it’s critical for innovation. And yet, making diversity visible is still a vital part of keeping your company accountable for proactive inclusion. But in order to do this, companies need to allow their employees to be themselves. What do we mean? Well, many business leaders worry that employees’ behavior on social media will affect the company’s image: should employees be allowed to list their company affiliation on their social media profile? What if they say something inappropriate? But stop worrying: companies that value diversity must be prepared to accept that they employ varied, human individuals — in all of their multifaceted complexity. And although companies can’t control what their employees say or do on social media, the risk of a public relations kerfuffle is more than worth taking — because you’ll be promoting a truly inclusive and generative company culture. In the previous blink, we discussed how companies can become more generative by fostering diversity. But it’s also worth noting that promoting collaboration also plays an important role in advancing generativeness within your business. To that end, companies first need to develop a narrative around their brands. That’s because in today’s world, simply having a good product or providing good service isn’t enough. Your customers need to have a clear idea of what your company stands for. How is your business doing good? What’s the story behind your products? And what role can customers play in shaping the brand?  This last question is an important one to address, because allowing consumers to collaborate with management in developing the brand image is a surefire way of ensuring that they become invested in the company. Consider Nokia. The cell phone giant has integrated open collaboration into its processes through a proprietary platform called IdeasProject. IdeasProject is unique because it treats collaboration like a two-way street: it allows customers to propose ideas they’d like to see Nokia adopt, and it also gives the company a platform to share ideas that were generated within the company but that aren’t being used. For Nokia, the advantage is clear: the company is able to harness the hive mind to generate new ideas. But the open nature of the channel also creates opportunities for the public and for developers to create new products based on concepts generated within Nokia. So the cell phone giant becomes more than a private company — it becomes a force benefiting the common good. And that is the very thing which makes a company generative. Generative growth is never simply a two-dimensional expansion of profits; rather, it’s all about multi-dimensional growth that benefits the system as a whole. The advantages of promoting collaboration are clear, but your company still has to take a risk to pursue this next level of transparency. So what can your company do to become more courageous? Here’s a frustrating but common workplace experience: someone comes up with a brilliant idea, but management worries it’s “too risky.” That kind of thinking stunts growth and innovation, but companies can avoid it by becoming more courageous. So, what’s the most important feature of a courageous company? Well a courageous company takes action without knowing the outcome. Netflix is one example of a company that consistently takes risks. Consider its innovative monthly flat fee streaming service and its strides into original programming: In both instances, the company wasn’t following anyone’s example. Rather, it showed courage and took action in the face of uncertainty — with stupendous results. Of course, not all companies have the same degree of marketing savvy. When other companies experiment, the results can sometimes be disappointing. But failure needn’t be a deterrent if you’ve established a learning culture — that is, if your company knows how to learn from its failures. One way to learn from failure is to encourage your company to engage in open-ended conversations. This can be challenging at first, because the way most businesses conduct strategy meetings tends to be predetermined: someone introduces a problem; then there’s a discussion about it; and finally the team decides on a solution. But to really learn, you have to be willing to embrace unexpected conversations that no one could have imagined in advance. So for example, try finding solutions at the beginning of the conversation, not at the end. And then ask yourself: how might those solutions prompt further questions about the organization’s processes? Clearly admit your mistakes is another important aspect of learning. It may seem counterintuitive to feel good about failure, but if you want to be part of a learning company, knowing how to embrace failure is essential. Google co-founder Larry Page articulated this view when he said that he wants to run a company that moves too quickly and does too much, rather than one that’s too cautious and unwilling to take risk. Of course, courage isn’t only about accepting failure. It’s also about figuring out how to act and move forward. And that’s where experimentation comes in. Experimentation isn’t about random change — or doing things differently “just because.” Rather, it’s about doing things that could be beneficial for the company. It can be difficult for risk-averse managers to embrace this approach — and for good reason! The metrics we typically use to measure performance are geared towards evaluating immediate results, not towards assessing innovation. After all, when was the last time that your boss gave you permission to fail, so long as you failed in a new, different way? But experimentation can only arise when we create space for it. And the often-cited 20% time policy used by Google (which led to the creation of popular products like Gmail) exemplifies the notion that companies can encourage experimentation. This doesn’t mean your company has to create policies that are as big or well-defined as Google’s model. Software company NFi Studios, for example, creates one-day developing binges for programming teams to hammer down important elements of the product. Because of the low time investment, employees feel less pressure to get it “right.” This allows the company to experiment and fail without expending a lot of time or resources on the process. But to truly embrace experimentation, your company has to come up with new evaluative metrics. For example, you could develop multiple subject lines for a single email marketing campaign, and measure the click-through and open rates in order to make decisions about how to formulate subject lines for future emails. After all, it’s much easier to justify experimentation and to harness its power when you can measure its effects. But whatever you decide to do, remember that you have the power to humanize your organization. The key message in this book: Although social media is revolutionizing business by making it more human, many companies haven’t adjusted to accommodate these changes. Although each company needs an individualized approach to adapt to the social media age, business leaders can pursue four general goals to humanize their organization: openness, trustworthiness, generativeness and courageousness. Actionable advice: When you hear yourself speaking about your company in mechanical metaphors, take a step back.  Think about why you are using such technical language, and consider how it might be influencing your business. Try to use language that enhances the more human aspects of your company: So think in terms of concepts like, for example, family, emotions or desire.

On the surface, we should all be quite happy – but, of course, so many of us just aren’t. A great deal of stress and misery in modern life comes from our inability to find enough time to both develop our career and enjoy our personal life. Most of us feel like we have to give up one of these essential goals, and concentrate solely on the other.  But this isn’t true. We don’t have to give up our job, nor spend every waking moment slaving away at it – we can do both, and these blinks show you how. Although they concentrate mostly on strategies for working mothers, there is plenty of excellent advice that everyone can learn from.  In these blinks, you’ll discover why none of us has to spend the majority of our time at work; the hour at which we are generally most productive; and why the family meal doesn’t have to be dinner. How much do you work? Most of us think we toil at work for far too long, and our work/life balance seems heavily skewed towards work. This is especially true of working mothers: the more time they spend at work, the less time they have to spend with their families. But is this true? According to the 2013 American Time Use Survey, the average mother with a full-time job works 35 hours per week. Mothers who earn over $100,000 USD work even more – up to 44 hours per week. This does seem like a lot, but let’s take a closer look. A week has 168 hours. If we sleep eight hours each night and work 44 hours each week, we’ve still got 68 hours per week that aren’t spent at work. So why do we all think we’re workaholics? It comes down to interruptions: those small, unexpected events that break up our working day can actually make it feel longer. In order to measure her working week, one woman tried to keep her days as routine as possible to get an accurate measure of her time management. But it just wasn’t feasible. Constant interruptions when she least expected them kept her from working at a regular pace. Snow days prevented her from going to work, as did days when her children’s kindergarten was closed and family events, from a christening to an airport pickup.  Interruptions like these make us constantly feel like we’re behind schedule and always needing to catch up on work. But we shouldn’t have to feel this way! In the following blinks, we will look how people, particularly working mothers, can arrange their lives in order to get the most out of their days, weeks and years. Working mothers all know the feeling of guilt. Whether we feel like we’re neglecting our families or our career responsibilities, we end up putting a huge amount of pressure on ourselves to fulfill other people’s needs. But this pressure doesn’t have to be there at all. As we’ve seen, there’s enough time in the week to commit to work and enjoy free time. It’s just a case of planning time to ensure you make the most of both. But how? The first step is to find your opportunities for flexibility in your work. Today, 97 percent of full-time employees are afforded some sort of flexibility, and it’s important that you make the most of it. Remember those interruptions we learned about in the previous blink? Well, it’s the flexibility of your job that will help you cope with them.  This flexibility goes in both directions: it allows you to leave work earlier in family emergencies, but it also allows you to work from home, so that when the kids are in bed you’re able to catch up on what didn’t get done during the day.  There are several approaches to increasing flexibility in your job. If you work long hours and want to find more time to spend with your family, you could start working split shifts.  This would mean working early morning hours before the kids wake up, then spending quality time with them over breakfast, after which you can return to work. Or you might leave work early to visit your kids’ activities in the afternoon, but then work another “shift” from home once they have gone to sleep.  Another idea is to work remotely from home or somewhere else at least one or two days a week. While many of us worry that working from home will cause our private and professional lives to mix in an unpleasant way, this isn’t necessarily the case. A study by IBM and BYO found that people who are able to work from home could work a whopping 57 hours per week before experiencing work-life conflicts – and that was only among a quarter of participants! The first step to enjoying free time is preventing yourself from working too much. Of course, you could limit your overtime hours by clocking off everyday at the same time, but if this means you stop working before completing certain tasks, you might begin to feel quite inefficient.  Your best option is to start the day with your toughest task. According to a study by Johnson & Johnson, a person’s energy level peaks at 8:00 a.m. So, save your gossiping with colleagues for lunch and spend the morning working on the most difficult item on your agenda – the one that is most urgent, and requires the most effort.  You can also maximize your efficiency by managing your meetings – they don’t have to be a pointless waste of your time! There are a couple of ways to go about this. First, look through your calendar and find the meetings for which your presence probably isn’t required. By choosing not to attend these kinds of meetings, you'll have gained an hour or so to work on something productively.  For the meetings you do have to attend, try and shorten them whenever possible. Say you’ve got two 60-minute meetings coming up. Why not shorten them to 45 minutes each? This isn’t a huge cut, but it will save you half an hour overall. It all adds up! Finally, to ensure you have enough time for yourself, plan things to do in your free time. Schedule something in the evening at least once a week that will get you out of the office early, or at least on time. Why not sign up for that guitar lesson starting in the early evening? You’ll also boost your motivation levels at work if you’ve got something to look forward to. The tips provided in the previous blink are easy and practical ways to improve your time management at work. There are two more techniques that will help you cut down stress in your job, but these require a little more thinking.  One strategy to streamline your week is to plan it before it even begins. According to a 2013 survey by Accountemps, Tuesday is the most productive day of the week with Monday lagging behind at only 26 percent productivity! Why is this?  Well, people tend to have a lot of meetings on Monday, and they also spend the day sorting through what needs to be done, as well as what wasn’t done the week before.  To avoid this “Monday trap,” plan your week at the end of the previous one. On Friday afternoon, just before you leave for the weekend, make a plan about what you are going to do in the week ahead. This will take some pressure off your Monday schedule. The final way to become more productive at work is simply to try and love what you do. We all know that we perform better when we enjoy what we’re doing. So, why not try and work on as many enjoyable things as possible? One woman leading a career in science, for instance, found that she was lacking drive at work. She realized that it was because her time was being taken up by administrative tasks, rather than the scientific research that she loved to do. So, she planned her weeks more consciously to ensure she could spend some hours in the lab again. Soon enough, her motivation returned.  So far, we’ve discovered strategies for excelling in our careers while finding time for ourselves. The next few blinks will focus on how you can bring new energy to your family life too.  Planning is key to an efficient and flexible work life. But what about when it comes to your home life?  Ultimately, your approach should be quite similar.  Spending quality time with your family requires some planning and the same motivation as your work life does. But remember: being around your family and being with your family are two different things.  Think through your weekday evenings and plan a shared activity with your family. No, watching TV together doesn’t count! If the sun is shining, why not take your kids to the playground and visit the ice cream truck afterwards? In the winter, it might be nice to take a weekly trip to the library and find some new books together.  Being active together is a great opportunity to spend quality time, and exercise is a proven mood booster. Why not take your kids to the pool once a week or go for a bike ride around the neighbourhood?  A classic way to enjoy family time is through sharing a meal together – but it doesn’t always have to be a sit-down dinner. A study by the UCLA found that only 17 percent of families have dinner together every night. About 60 percent have dinner semi-regularly, but these dinners tended to be fragmented. Instead, why not try sharing breakfast together, or coming home to enjoy a family lunch.  Another family activity that we often dismiss is taking your kids to work. If you think it’d be too boring for them, think again! We often forget that, for kids, even the simplest activities around our work life (like riding an elevator or seeing a conference room) can be an adventure. Why not take them with you on special occasions?  This also gives you an educational opportunity to share your passions, and discuss matters of success and challenge. Once you start taking greater efforts to enjoy family time, it’s also important to consider how you could spend more romantic time with your partner. When asked by the author what they’d do with more free time, most women answered they’d like to spend more adults-only time with their husbands or partners. Between juggling the demands of work and family, our love lives inevitably get neglected. But it needn’t be this way! The key to finding time for romantic moments in your busy schedule is making it a priority and being creative with timing.  Remember those dates you had at the beginning of your relationship? Believe it or not, it’s still possible to have those dates again – it just takes a little bit of planning. A date doesn’t have to be at night; in fact, what could be nicer than taking a break in your busy schedule to have a romantic lunch with your partner in the city? An important thing to remember is that administrative time with your partner, in which you plan childcare, groceries and so on, should be scheduled separately from romantic time.  As strange as it sounds, some couples like to think that going shopping or cleaning together counts as romantic time. While it might be fun to do things as a team, romantic time works best when you can just concentrate on each other and nothing else.  Finally, seize opportunities and savor moments as they come – you don’t have to have each moment carefully planned. No one is too busy for a five-minute morning cuddle in bed, or a kiss with your partner before you take off to work in the morning. There’s nothing worse than finishing work and coming home to a house full of pending chores. There’s no point in using time management to create free time for yourself if you just fill it up with housework. In times like these, it’s important to just let go.  Remember, you’re not participating in some game show that gives you extra points for empty clothes hampers or supremely well-adjusted children. So, how can you begin to let go of your perfectionism? Well, one mother decided she would let her daughter wear whatever she wanted to school, letting go of the mandatory morning fight about matching clothes. Her daughter is still alive and happy, even though sometimes her shirt doesn’t match her skirt. For her part, the woman found she had less to stress about each morning.  Another important step is learning to accept help. Nobody can do everything by themselves, and there’s no shame in getting some assistance when you can. It lets you focus on what you do best.  If your financial budget allows for it, you can get help cleaning the house, the garden or have groceries delivered to save time. Kids can also participate in housework and learn to take responsibility by doing so.  Childcare is a good way to save yourself time, but plan it wisely. Did you know it’s often easier and more time-effective to have someone come to your house for childcare, such as a nanny, rather than investing in daycare?  Of course, it’s important not to skimp on childcare.  Not only is it vital that your child spends time in an environment where they feel safe and encouraged, your career will also benefit from it. According to economist Sylvia Hewlett, women who take at least three years for parental leave lose 37 percent of their earning power over the remaining decades of their careers.  So, finding childcare that you feel comfortable with, even if it costs a little more, is worth it in the end.  So you’ve made time for work, for your family and for your partner. Now it’s time to make time for yourself. If you still think it’s not possible, here’s a little experiment for you to try: get addicted to a TV show.  Think about it, when you are totally absorbed in House of Cards, free time almost magically seems to appear out of nowhere. You might find that you have half an hour after work and before dinner where you can squeeze in an episode. In fact, you’ll start to find free hours whenever you can.  Now that you’ve worked out how to find these free hours, why not start using them for something more rewarding? Studies show that TV is fun, but only ranks near the middle on scales of human enjoyment. It is better than commuting or getting your car repaired, but it is less fun than socializing or having sex.  Reading scores a little higher on the enjoyment scale, but what’s even more fun is getting creative in your leisure time. Creative leisure time can include picking fresh fruit, garden work in general, going to the opera or knitting.  Finally, remember that you’re allowed to take a personal day off from time to time. Larry Kanarek, who managed the McKinsey office in Washington, D.C., observed that everybody who was quitting because of exhaustion and burnout had free vacation time that they had not yet used.  So why take the risk? Use your vacation days before you get tired of working, and put yourself first. After all, it’s only by taking care of yourself that you can continue being all the women you want to be: professional, partner, mother and individual. The key message in this book: As working mothers, we want to do it all: build a career, raise a family and find personal time. But doing so requires some balancing and organizing, as well as letting go of your perfectionist demands. This will leave you feeling happier, fulfilled and able to appreciate the small, beautiful moments in life as they come. Actionable advice:  Work well to sleep well!  Be careful with the kind of work you do right before bed when you are working split shifts, as staring at a screen at night may result in a restless sleep. Plan this shift as you would plan your workday, being sure to include time to unwind before going to bed. You even might find some tasks that don’t require much focus, such as answering some emails, planning the next day or editing documents, that are well suited to a quiet late night session.

Waterman Jr.","summary":"The path to the holy grail of business management has proved elusive. While many loyal Lancelots and management consultants have fought the dragons guarding the secrets of management, few have survived. Well, at least until 1982, when Tom Peters and Robert H. Waterman Jr. decided to unsheath Galahad’s sword and head straight to the source. No, not some castle, but the people who actually ran the most successful companies in American history. And if the authors didn’t find the holy grail of business management, then maybe it’s not meant to be found – they certainly vanquished a few myths on the way. In Search of Excellence is the result of their quest – an instant classic that shows how the great companies built their successes and faced their challenges. After reading these blinks, you’ll have learned how to grow without sacrificing a small business’s flexibility and innovation; why just walking around constitutes a great management strategy; and why Procter & Gamble lets its brands fight against each other. Every business leader wants to know the best way to manage their company. But why are there so many different approaches and schools of thought? Well, management theory has long been a topic of general concern and disagreement among academics. In the 1930s, Harvard’s Chester Barnard rejected long-held ideas about bureaucratic management that were put forward earlier by thinkers like Max Weber. Barnard’s work kicked off a debate about whether management was an impersonal, objective and exact science, or more of an art relying on charismatic leadership. In the 1970s, when the authors began their research, a key area of concern among management theorists was international competition – especially in countries like Japan, where companies were growing at a much faster rate. Observers noticed that Japan’s lack of business schools had produced a different management culture than in the United States. This observation led to questions about whether Americans, with all their management classes, had adopted an overly theoretical approach. The authors decided to find some concrete answers amid the speculation. So they assembled a list of America’s top 15 companies – boiled down from 43 contenders – and spent six months conducting interviews and doing research to figure out what they all had in common. Their results were popularized in the book’s first edition, published in 1982. The 15 companies were selected using two criteria: So, according to these criteria, in 1982 the 15 top American companies were: Bechtel, Boeing, Caterpillar Inc., Dana, Delta Airlines, Digital Equipment, Emerson Electric, Fluor, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Johnson & Johnson, McDonald’s, Procter & Gamble and 3M. But what attributes did all of these companies share? Read on to find out. So, what do successful companies have in common? Well, the authors noticed that all the top companies they surveyed had an action bias. That is, these firms had the ability to get things done, regardless of the complexity of the task. Although most companies want to believe they have an action bias, not many do. Instead of getting things done, most businesses get tangled up in bureaucracy. After all, when countless committees have to sign off on any given decision, there’s a high barrier to action. Excellent companies deal with this issue by adopting organizational fluidity. This term refers to the ability to resolve issues, especially problems that require multiple levels of bureaucratic attention. For example, top companies would have a system in place to efficiently cope with a product issue that needed input from a variety of departments – such as the product, legal and advertising teams. These organizations create fluidity by promoting vast informal networks for communication, like open door policies. At IBM, for example, the chairman personally addressed any complaints he received from his 350,000 employees. United Airlines had a similar policy, called “Management by Walking Around,” which encouraged quick, casual conversations at every level of the company. These informal communication processes created opportunities for companies to quickly address issues without superfluous bureaucracy. Chunking – breaking things down – is another way companies can encourage action and optimize organizational fluidity. By creating small groups – task teams of fewer than ten people dedicated to solving specific problems – companies can nimbly deal with problems as soon as they arise. Although these task teams don’t typically show up on formal organization charts (which represent more conventional units like departments and divisions), small groups tend to be the true organizational backbone of excellent companies. Consider Canon, which organized a task team to develop and launch the AE-1 camera in just two and a half years. Today, the camera is widely regarded as a groundbreaking technological advancement. As Lew Young, former editor-in-chief of Businessweek, once observed, too many companies regard the customer as basically a bothersome nuisance who damages carefully laid business plans. But excellent companies take a different approach. America’s top companies have a service obsession. Meaning, the needs of the customer intrude into every facet of the business, from research to sales to accounting. These companies may seem almost ludicrously committed to their customers, but in fact they’re using this service obsession to make up for shortfalls in other areas. IBM, for example, hasn’t been a leader in the technology sector for decades. However, since the brand is synonymous with service, the company has maintained its position as an industry leader. While assistants at other companies spend their days fetching coffee or pushing paper, entry level IBM staffers spend their first three years fielding customers complaints – which must always be resolved within 24 hours. This practice yields a better understanding of what products and services the company needs to satisfy its customers. Additionally, this policy builds customer loyalty. Since IBM is committed to quickly resolving all issues, many businesses have come to rely on the company for all their software and hardware needs. But good customer service doesn’t just allow a company to resolve issues and build a customer base – it also enables innovation. Consider the fact that Procter & Gamble, one of the most consistently successful companies ever, was the first consumer goods corporation that put a toll-free number on its products. Employees later reported that this move led to most of the company’s product improvements. An MIT study about the innovation of scientific instruments corroborates P&G’s experience: After studying 11 new inventions, researchers found that they were all originally conceptualized by end users – not producers – of the instruments. So ultimately, excellent companies know that customers bring value beyond the final sale. Did you know that small businesses produce 24-times more innovation per dollar than larger firms? So what about the excellent – and huge – multinational corporations surveyed by the authors? Although these companies are big, they act small in terms of innovation. How do they do it? Well, internal competition plays a key role because it fosters a sense of autonomy and entrepreneurship – even within the large corporate structure. And autonomy and entrepreneurship are crucial to innovation, because they give employees the opportunity to develop creative ideas that go beyond their job description. Internal competition creates the space for this kind of creativity. It brings the competitive outside market into the company, thus promoting innovation and preventing stagnation. IBM, for example, uses a “performance shoot-out” approach: Proposed products are pitted against each other, which results in real performance comparisons between prototypes. Procter & Gamble also takes an interesting approach to adopting internal competition. In 1931, the company established a formal policy that allowed different brands in the company to actively compete. Managers typically don’t have access to information about other P&G brands, beyond what’s publicly known. This competitive element motivates brands to continuously improve their products, which ultimately benefits P&G’s overall sales. There’s another key characteristic that promotes innovation among the big companies surveyed in the study: These companies embrace failure by encouraging experimentation and an entrepreneurial spirit. When something doesn’t work out, these companies just move on to the next thing. 3M is one such company. For example, when a new ribbon material the company was developing failed, 3M tried using it as material for a brassiere. When that also failed, the company didn’t give up. Eventually, it became the standard material in safety masks worn by government workers. So as you can see, promoting internal competition and encouraging experimentation ensures innovation even at large companies. There’s another thing excellent companies have in common, and that is a deeply ingrained respect for individual employees. In other words, top companies sincerely care about their employees and create people-oriented working environments. Management respects individual employees, invests time and money into their development and holds them to reasonable expectations. Many companies pretend to be people-oriented, and give the outward appearance of caring about their employees, but it’s often just a facade. This attitude typically results in two kinds of management disasters: So, if that’s what insincere people-orientation looks like, how do companies of excellence show that they genuinely care? Well, these top companies typically adopted people-oriented policies long before they were the norm. For example, these firms were among the first to implement training programs. They also encouraged employees and managers to communicate on a first-name basis back when the traditional business culture was more formal. Hewlett-Packard is a fantastic example of a people-oriented company. In fact, in individual interviews with 20 HP executives, 18 mentioned the company´s people-oriented philosophy as a key reason for its success. As it happens, the “HP Way” has a long history. In the 1940s, executives decided that they didn’t want HP to be a “hire and fire” company. So, instead of firing employees during the 1970s recession, the entire company took a ten percent pay cut. In the end, HP survived the recession without terminating anyone’s employment. As a manager, what can you do to mimic highly successful companies? Well, you might start by establishing some company values. That’s because excellent companies set out qualitative values aimed at inspiring employees at every level of the company. The authors cite a study conducted by McKinsey & Co. that also looked at top-performing companies, but through the specific lens of company values. The results showed that nearly all of the companies surveyed had well-defined guiding values. One such value at the Dana Corporation, for example, was an inclusive management style that prioritized simplicity. Companies that performed less successfully shared two defining characteristics: To that last point – and this may seem counterintuitive – the companies whose values were the most financially oriented and quantifiable actually fared worse than firms with broader qualitative values (such as customer service, for example). And if there’s one such broader qualitative value that is shared by all top companies, it’s a commitment to innovation at every level. It’s important to note that innovation is crucial at all kinds of companies, be they technology companies (like Apple and Hewlett-Packard), manufacturing companies (3M) or consumer goods firms (Johnson & Johnson). And this value is characterized by the understanding that innovation is a somewhat random and unpredictable element of business. So, since it can’t be centrally planned or sidelined into just one department, it needs to be the goal of the whole company. The underlying belief here is that everyone is capable of innovation, not just the research and development departments. This mind-set leads to a company-wide culture, where everyone is always on the lookout for the “next big thing.” And ultimately, this forward-looking ethos helps the company achieve consistent growth. As a company becomes more successful, there’s always the temptation to buy out the competition or branch out into new markets and sectors. This is called diversification, and it can be done by creating a new products or buying a company in a different sector – with the ultimate hope of making more money. Apple is a diversification success story. Consider the fact that it expanded its product range from computers to music players to phones. Today, it’s even making watches! But the truth is, it’s not always so easy. Because diversification isn’t necessarily linked to profitability. That’s what the economist Michael Gort discovered when he conducted the first systematic study of diversification in American businesses. Although he did notice a mild positive correlation between the number of new products a company introduced and increases in sales, he saw absolutely no positive relationship between new product launches and actual profitability. But as it turns out, there is a secret to profitable diversification – and it’s called “sticking to your knitting.” Companies that “stick to their knitting” are the ones that diversify, but keep their new products and services consistent with their central skills and strengths. This principle comes from Richard Rumelt’s seminal study on diversification, which found that successful companies would only branch out when they could build on their existing strengths and competences. These companies would achieve a 12.4 percent return on the money they spent; all in all, that’s 30 percent more than companies that diversified haphazardly. 3M, for example, has over 50,000 products, with 100 new ones added each year. However, each one of these products relied on the company’s signature coating and bonding technology. And 3M isn’t alone: From Boeing to Walmart, the dominant approach to diversification among top companies is one of sticking to core strengths. Success has its own challenges. And one of the drawbacks of growth is that as a company expands, it hires more people, ends up with larger departments – and finds itself with a super-complex organizational structure. So, imagine a small company with a functional organizational structure. Employees are grouped together according to whatever function they perform, such as marketing, legal work or sales. In this structure, it’s clear whom people should report to – be it the manager or the CEO. But as the company gets bigger, it outgrows this rigid structure. And it becomes inefficient for everyone to report up the hierarchy all the time, because it prevents individual employees from dealing with unpredictable or time-sensitive issues. Companies try to cope with this issue by implementing a matrix organizational structure, creating discrete teams responsible for specific products and functions. So, for example, Product Team A works with Legal Team A and Sales Team A. But this gets complicated very quickly. Since there are many different managers running different teams, employees get confused about whom they should report to. But excellent companies find their way around this by embracing simple form – stable, unchanging organizational structures – and lean staff. “Lean staff” means minimal administrative, managerial and executive layers. So at these companies, there will be just one manager or department head, instead of multiple people for employees to report to. And even though Johnson & Johnson was a $5 billion company with 150 independent divisions – each worth an average of $30 million – it was a perfect example of this kind of organizational simplicity. Each division is called a “company” and has its own “chair of the board.” Even though the “companies” don’t have their own stocks and are by no means independent from J&J’s top management, they still play a very important role. The chairmen shield their divisions from unwanted bureaucratic interference. Furthermore, since each division controls its own marketing, distribution and research, it leads to better, more efficient decision-making, and ultimately requires fewer people. The key message: People have long debated the best way to manage a company. Well, it turns out that excellent companies have a lot in common: Top businesses put a premium on customer service. They also sincerely care about their own employees and promote experimentation within the company.  Actionable advice: Let your employees use the company’s resources and tools in their free time. If you want to promote innovation at your company, encourage your employees to freely use the company’s resources – like laboratory or manufacturing equipment – in their downtime. Being able to “play” with the tools of the trade without a specific, defined purpose might lead to startling and unexpected breakthroughs.

Just think of all the politicians out there, struggling to get people to adopt their viewpoint. Most fail. And only a handful ever reach a position of power. But there is a way to win people over. You can become an influencer. You just need to know how. And this is where these blinks come in. By approaching the act of influencing from fields such as sociology and psychology, you can learn some key techniques and get more people to join your side. If you work in a client-focused role, or in public policy, then these blinks are essential reading. In these blinks, you’ll also discover why the size of your workspace determines what people think of you; how a powerful Tanzanian radio drama helped transforms society; and how, if meted out correctly, rewards can help change behavior. We all want to influence the world, to make it a better place for ourselves and everyone else. But what’s the best way to actually do that? Merely wanting to improve things isn’t the same as actually making improvements. So what should we do? For starters, you need to pinpoint the goal you’re striving for. Most of us have some vague conception of what we want to achieve, and, because of this haziness, we never make concrete plans to get there. As a result, we often fail. If you want to positively influence the world, you must have a goal – a tangible, measurable goal, and a timeframe for getting there. Take Dr. Don Berwick, former CEO of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI). Berwick wanted to decrease the mortality rate of people who use health care, for instance, by checking into a hospital. Actually, he claims that health care is one of the main causes of death in the US. So he set a concrete goal: Save 100,000 lives by 9 a.m. on June 14, 2006. Such precision is already a step toward effecting change. To make headway on your goal, it’s vital that you concentrate on the behaviors that will get you there. True influencers don’t care about behaviors unrelated to the impact they want to have. Instead, they concentrate their efforts on two or three behaviors that will yield the biggest impact once mastered. Take Dr. Wiwat, Thailand’s Minister for Public Health. Wiwat set out to drastically cut the AIDS rate in his home country. After discovering that 97 percent of HIV infections resulted from intercourse with heterosexual sex workers, he saw that the behavior that needed to change was the sex worker’s decision of whether or not to use a condom. Targeting this behavior only, Wiwat successfully stopped Thailand from becoming the country with the highest percentage of HIV-infected people in the world. If you want to influence people’s behavior, you need to convince them of your way of thinking. So what’s the most effective way of doing this? When we feel we’re being forced to change, we feel as if we’re surrendering our free will. Being able to persuade others is therefore a far better approach. One technique you can use to do this is motivational interviewing, developed by Dr. William Miller. Here, you can use open questions to guide the interviewee to think about their behavior. Let’s say you’re speaking with someone with an alcohol problem. You might first ask about their everyday life and general happiness, then transition to their eating habits and, finally, move on to their drinking. The questions you ask should allow the other person to approach the subject on their own terms, without any pressure from you. There are times, though, when verbal persuasion isn’t enough. In these cases, give the person the chance to gain some real experience about it. This is what Dr. Don Berwick did after leading a Harvard seminar on patient safety for hospital CEOs. The seminar went well, but the CEOs failed to put theory into practice. After realizing this, Berwick advised the CEOs to investigate some of the injured patients themselves. This firsthand experience considerably reinforced the CEOs’ commitment to the issue. Storytelling is another powerful influence tool that ensures lasting behavioral change. For example, in 1993, Martha Swai changed the behavior of the Tanzanian people through storytelling. On her radio program “Twende na Wakati“ (“Let's Go with the Times”), she created a character, a man named Mkwaju, who abused alcohol and had unprotected sex with prostitutes. Many husbands who’d listened to the show later reported that they identified with Mkwaju, who embodied their own shameful transgressions. This story helped reflect upon and change their behavior for the better. Storytelling works well when it comes to influence. But don’t forget to provide real experiences, so that others don’t get caught up in merely thinking or imagining circumstances. Many stories tell of a solitary, brave hero who solves all humanity’s problems. But, in reality, this rarely ever happens. Being a true influencer means working with and inspiring others so that you can realize your goals collectively, not saving the day singlehandedly.A great way to influence people is to help them reach a goal that they already share with others. There is a natural drive in people with a mutual goal, and often an influencer’s job is simply to identify these group members and give them the best opportunity to reach that goal together. This is what Dr. Muhammad Yunus did after witnessing poverty in Bangladesh. The people there were trapped in destitution because they couldn’t receive even modest credit from local banks, which barred them from establishing small businesses that might bring a profit. So, Dr. Yunus created the Grameen Bank and gave credit to groups of five people. He knew that getting five people to work together to pull themselves out of poverty would instigate a shared ambition and generate the best ideas. Dr. Yunus’s initiative worked, and poverty in Bangladesh dropped dramatically. Grameen Bank is now worth millions of dollars. Working together also entails sharing individual problems with one another. Often, we’re terrified of admitting our problems or mistakes, but the only way we can solve them is to share them and recruit others to help us. For instance, in software-development culture, lying about one’s inability to meet a deadline happens so often that it gave rise to the term project chicken. Here, the first person in a meeting to openly admit that they need a new deadline is known as the “chicken.” Although being the “chicken” doesn’t sound desirable, it’s actually helpful, because only when problems are shared do we know exactly what needs to be done. Once this is known, the group can move in the right direction. Doing the right thing often isn’t the same as doing the easiest thing. And, when we try to influence others to change their ways for the better, we often end up making them do things they don’t want to do. This is where rewards – when given wisely – can help. If somebody is intrinsically highly motivated to do something, a reward will energize and strengthen that commitment. Even minor rewards can influence people to produce unexpectedly positive results. Take Dr. Stephen Higgins, who helps cocaine addicts. Often, people struggling with addiction drop out of rehabilitation programs too early, and therefore relapse. So, to increase the percentage of people completing these programs, Dr. Higgins gave participants a voucher. These participants were tested for cocaine once per month for three months; if all three tests came back negative, they could exchange the voucher for goods. This simple incentive produced some great results: the voucher was responsible for 90 percent of the recovering addicts finishing the three-month treatment program. Out of those who didn’t receive a voucher, only 65 percent finished the program. It’s important to note, however, that rewards can backfire when misused. To prevent this from happening, you must take some psychological patterns into account when trying to positively influence someone.  It’s natural for people to assume that their behavior is right, no matter how “bad” it is. A reward therefore only assists people if it doesn’t encourage their behavior. A theory known as the overjustification hypothesis describes this phenomenon of rewards exacerbating negative behavior. It states that people often interpret rewards as a reason for perpetuating certain behaviors. For example, the reason an alcoholic may keep drinking might be precisely because they know they’ll be rewarded for quitting. It’s also key to remember that rewards are no substitute for motivation. The person you’re trying to influence may only behave differently because of the reward, which is hardly enough motivation to make lasting change. In daily life, we take our surroundings for granted. But changing them can have a dramatic effect on our behavior. And, of course, the same goes for others and the influence we have on them.Let’s start with space. Space is an influencing tool that functions subtly and without pressure. If we want to influence people without directly catching their attention, one of the best ways is to alter their space. But how?  Distance has a tremendous effect on our psyche, yet it’s easy to overlook once we’ve become accustomed to the structure of our environment. Simple yet powerful characteristics of a room such as its dimensions or the size of the windows exert great influence over us. For example, long distances and large rooms create an atmosphere of power, particularly in places of business. So, if you want to develop a rapport with others, you should opt for smaller spaces. One CEO who wanted to create a closer relationship with his employees failed to realize this. When the authors visited him, they needed to pass through six long hallways and four secretary stations. Not a great way to bond with your employees! Besides dimensions and room features, the quality of the surroundings also shapes behavior. A chaotic environment, for instance, makes us agitated and even angry, even if we’re normally calm. Moreover, the broken windows theory – essentially, that squalor leads to more squalor – tells us that disordered environments can result in antisocial behavior, because disorder signifies an absence of authority. Many customer-service departments have to know all about the connection between environment and mood. For example, to ensure that customers keep calm, service areas are kept clean, with comfortable seats and pleasant artwork decorating the walls. From the moment we wake up to the moment we settle back in for sleep, objects play a central role in our lives. The best influencers know how to harness and shift behavior by using these objects. Much like space, objects are silent influencers that trigger zero resistance. Take the following two examples: Beautiful things make us curious. We want to look at them, touch them and try them out. Therefore, if you want someone to read a book you have written, be sure to give it an eye-catching, attractive cover. We can also harness the power of the freebie by playing to our propensity to strive for equality in social relationships. According to psychologist John Stacey Adam’s equity theory, we’re always trying to pay back offers we receive from other people to re-establish equality. So, start giving away things for nothing to influence others to give something back! The way you present things also affects and has an impact on people's behavior. Packaging has a massive influence over our consumption without our even being aware of it. For example, social scientist Brian Wansink gave moviegoers differently sized popcorn bags. Despite the fact that all participants had the same appetite, those with large bags ate 50 percent more popcorn than those with smaller bags. Making invisible quantities visible also ensures that goods are used in the most efficient way. For example, before the fill to here line became the standard in international shipping containers, they were only filled to capacity about half the time. After the introduction of this simple line, this increased to 95 percent.  Lastly, if you want to guarantee results, you can go further than suggesting behavior by using packaging and objects; you can completely eliminate undesired behavior. This is the most radical method of influencing. Examples of this can be seen in the automatization of customer service, where customer orders at fast food restaurants are taken only by using special buttons. The key message in this book: If you want to have an impact on people and become an expert influencer, you must hone the necessary verbal skills, be able to understand psychological patterns and understand how everyday objects and surroundings shape and control our behavior. Actionable advice: Practice your storytelling. Telling an engaging, convincing story is an art that requires training. It can also make you a powerful influencer. To better your powers of persuasion, try attending a few public events associated with your goal where nobody knows you. After introducing yourself to the attendees, practice telling people about a project you'd like to launch and attempt to convince them to partake in it. The more you practice your story, asking others questions about themselves, and incorporating direct experience, the better you will become at influencing others. Got feedback?

Mostly this is because the product manager’s role has been poorly defined or the person is incapable of filling that role. Hence, many CEOs wonder what characteristics to look for when hiring product managers. In fact, a wide array of attributes and skills is needed. Essentially, product managers solve customers’ problems, and this requires them to understand their customers and empathize with their problems as well as be intelligent and insightful enough to come up with solutions. Product managers must also be engaging and versatile communicators. They must interact with lots of different stakeholder groups from engineers to executives, and hence need to be “bilingual” in the sense that they understand both the technology and business sides of the product. Finally, product managers bear full responsibility for delivering products as promised. They face long hours at work and a constant overload of tasks, so they need to have a strong work ethic and good time-management skills. Above all else, they must know how to prioritize. Their mantra is: “The main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing.” So where can you find such people? A great and obvious source is within your own company, where it is easier to find and assess candidates just by asking around. Look everywhere: Great future product managers can be waiting in virtually any department, from engineering to customer service to marketing. Typically, they will have already expressed some interest in playing a stronger role in the product. Once you find them, train and mentor them to fill the role successfully. Great product managers are intelligent, focused and “bilingual” in technology and business. A product manager has two main responsibilities: evaluating product opportunities and defining the products to be built to address those opportunities. To allow her to focus on these tasks, the product manager needs a product team around her, much like a CEO needs a management team to run a company. This team comprises several well-defined roles: User experience designers create the product’s interface toward the customer. This crucial role means they must work closely with the product manager. Engineers, also a vital component of the team, build the product that the product manager has defined. This makes them the product manager’s peers, not subordinates. To help engineers understand what the product needs to do, the product manager must involve them early in the process and have them actually meet and observe real customers. A dedicated project manager is also recommended to oversee the work of engineers in the execution phase. This allows the product manager to focus on discovering and defining new products while the project manager schedules and tracks the projects required to build and launch them. A separate product marketing person is needed to tell the world about the product. Naturally, both she and the product manager should give each other input to help formulate marketing messages and product requirements respectively. Finally, every product team can benefit from seeking out the smartest people in the company, regardless of function or position, and making them unofficial “deputy product managers.” If asked for ideas and feedback, they can deliver a surprising amount of value just based on their smarts. Product managers need product teams around them with clearly defined roles. Good user experience (UX) is a vital component of good products. The iPod, for example, owed much of its success to the pleasant and effortless UX. To create a good UX, the product manager must work intensively with a UX design team, which ideally comprises four essential roles: An interaction designer works to understand the target users’ requirements and thinking, and then creates a wireframe design of the product based on this understanding. After this, visual designers contribute the look and feel of the user interface on top of the wireframe. Essentially, these two roles create the user experience, making them a key part of the product team. They should be involved early on, taking part in everything from deciding on the product strategy to participating in customer visits. Note that the importance of visual designers is often sadly underestimated. Their work has the power to evoke emotions in the customers, and if Apple has shown us anything, it is that products that evoke strong emotions, like love and craving, tend to be smash hits. In addition to these two roles, you need a rapid prototyper who can quickly create prototypes of the product and a usability tester who then has users test the product, thus generating input for another iteration of the design process. To allow her UX design team to fully contribute, a product manager must let them complete their work before tasking engineers with building the product. This is because good designers want to experiment with multiple designs, but the engineering process is not agile enough to facilitate this. Make user experience design a priority: Build a complete UX team and help them contribute. Opportunities for new products are everywhere around us, and new ideas, innovative technologies and shifting competitive landscapes create fresh opportunities every day. They exist even in seemingly saturated markets. Remember AltaVista and Infoseek? Their dominance of the search engine market seemed unassailable until Google came along. In this endlessly shifting landscape, a product manager must constantly and quickly evaluate product opportunities and decide which ones to pursue. To help achieve this, she should answer a list of questions used to help define and communicate such opportunities, called a Product Opportunity Assessment (POA): What problem will this solve? Who are we solving a problem for and how big is that market? What alternatives do competitors provide and why are we the ones who can succeed in this? What factors are critical to success (e.g. partnerships with distributors)? What metrics will we use to measure our success? Why is this the right time to enter the market and what is our go-to-market strategy (i.e. how will we sell the product)? Based on the above questions, is this an opportunity we should pursue? This light and easy-to-understand tool can greatly help analyze and communicate product opportunities without resorting to rigid and overly long documentation methods. Its results can then be discussed with senior management and a clear go/no-go decision can be reached, thus helping the product manager focus her efforts. Note that all questions in the POA are geared toward understanding the opportunity, not presupposing a solution. Only after finding a product opportunity to pursue does a product manager begin the product discovery phase: defining the right product to fit that opportunity. A product manager must constantly seek out and assess product opportunities. To be successful, a product must be: \nfeasible: your engineers must be capable of building it. \nusable: customers must be able to use it. \nvaluable: the product itself must deliver value to customers, so they want to buy it. All three criteria need to be tested and validated before building the product. To facilitate this, the product manager and her UX interaction designer should first come up with a minimal product prototype: one that has the bare minimum functionality necessary to be valuable, and yet delivers a realistic enough user experience for real users to test. Involve an engineer in defining the minimal product so they can gauge its feasibility and help the product manager decide which features to cut and which to leave in. This ensures the engineers are confident that they can implement the features that remain, and hence no more cutting is required later on. In short, the product should now be feasible. Once a minimal product is arrived at, a prototype can be built and tested with real users to validate whether it is usable and valuable. Once you’ve validated a product and delivered the specifications to engineering, you must make a fundamental mindset shift from product discovery to execution. There should be no further changes to the product specifications after this. If management requests changes after this point, don’t lose focus on execution but rather start a new discovery process for version 2.0 of your product to run in parallel with building version 1.0. Product discovery: Validate that your product is valuable, usable and feasible by defining and testing a minimal product. A key responsibility of a product manager is to deliver accurate product specifications to the engineering team. The most effective way to do this is to build a high-fidelity prototype: a prototype with minimal functionality, but a realistic user experience. In the case of simple websites, for example, the prototype may just comprise clickable buttons that lead to different pages. The end-goal is a prototype that anyone can easily interact with to understand the product, without necessarily having to look at any product specs. In addition to being a handy tool for communicating product specs, a hi-fi prototype allows product managers to immediately test the product with real users. The sooner this happens, the easier it is to adjust the product according to the feedback. So how does this testing happen? When setting up a prototype test, first of all you’ll need test subjects. Gather them from whatever sources you can: friends, family or Craigslist recruits. All are fair game. Second, be sure to prepare thoroughly beforehand. Define what tasks you want the users to complete, focusing on the tasks they are expected to spend the most time on. During the test itself, the less you say, the better. Don’t taint the test subjects’ experiences with your own expectations. Your goal is to observe and understand where your model might be inconsistent with how a user thinks. Just watch: Can they complete the tasks easily? Do they find what they’re looking for? If you identify obvious problems after the first test subjects, fix them immediately. This way, the next users can already test your new solution. Use high-fidelity prototypes to convey product specs effectively and to test your product on real users. If you’re a product manager, understanding customers is a critical part of your job. In fact, it’s so important that you should attend every site visit, customer interview and usability test as well as use whatever market-research tools are available to really gain a deep understanding of customers. Note, though, that customers are notoriously poor at expressing what exactly they want from a product. Therefore, don’t let their input directly steer the course you take with your product. Instead, stay focused on identifying customer needs, and think for yourself how to address those needs. A great way to gain deep customer insights is a charter user program (CUP). Basically, this is a program where you find and recruit 8–10 customers from your target market who suffer from the problem your product aims to solve. You then work with these customers as partners to develop and test a product to address this issue. Your end goal is to develop a product that works for your whole target market, so don’t fall into the trap of making a specialized product for just one or two of your charter users. Using a CUP is beneficial for the participating customers because they gain early – usually free – access to the product. Remember, it solves a painful problem for them, so the earlier they can use it, the better for them. You, on the other hand, gain extensive access to users from your target market, allowing you to rapidly test prototypes of your product and refine it accordingly. Eventually, when you launch the product, you can realize the second big advantage of a CUP: use the participants as satisfied customer references, which are essential for any successful product launch. Use a charter user program to understand your customers and gain references for your launch. Effective product management means constantly prioritizing and making choices: Which product opportunities should be pursued? Which features should be included in the product? Which tasks are most important? These decisions are difficult because, typically, every stakeholder in the company will feel strongly and differently about them. To help resolve these tradeoffs, you should define a set of product principles: your beliefs of what’s truly important to the strategy of this entire product line and the company. In the case of a start-up, the company’s mission statement often embodies these principles. Despite their strategic nature, the principles need to be specific enough to help guide any decisions regarding features, target customers, etc. For example, if an online auction provider has decided that its primary product principle is safety, then it should not hesitate to increase security measures for customers, even at the cost of usability. Another excellent tool for making difficult product choices is the use of personas: fictional user profiles of (imaginary) typical customers. These personas are created by the product manager and interaction designer based on what they know about their potential customers. For example, you could say that your potential customers are “Marys” (professional, tech-savvy women in their 30s) and “Freddys” (male students with limited income). Depending on whether you prioritize “Marys” or “Freddys,” you will likely choose very different features to include in your product. Such simple archetypes help align the whole product team on who the customer is and what is important for them. Just make sure that at some stage, you also talk to real users and verify your personas are accurate! Product management is about making choices: Use personas and product principles to help you with this. When improving existing products rather than launching new ones, many product managers fall into a modus of just fixing bugs and adding features as requested. But bolting on features indiscriminately to please specific customers often makes the product less appealing to the rest of the market, hurting its success in the long run. Just as with new products, product improvement should start with an understanding of what your goals are. You must understand the product’s most important business metrics and gear any improvements toward affecting those metrics. Say your product is a website where a key metric is what percentage of visitors become customers – currently 5%. You may then introduce a new feature to raise that percentage, like an easier sign-up process. If the percentage rises to 10%, you’ve just added a very valuable feature! An especially valuable time to make changes to a product comes right after the product launch. Lots of lessons can be learned in the first week when the product is actually live. During this time, consider yourself in “rapid response” mode, addressing issues or lagging key metrics quickly. When improving products, be careful that you don’t unwittingly abuse your users, i.e. release changes that they don’t appreciate. To avoid this, ensure you deploy changes gently. This means you inform customers of changes well in advance and make the transition as painless as possible. Redouble your quality assurance efforts, and for major changes, consider running the old and new versions of your product in parallel, at least initially, allowing users to opt in as they please. When you make changes to your product, think carefully about what you want to achieve and deploy them gently. The key message in this book: A product manager’s main responsibilities are assessing product opportunities and defining products to address those opportunities. The product manager and her team must ensure the products launched are feasible, usable and valuable, by creating a prototype of the product and testing it with real users as soon as possible.

Unless you’re the Grinch, or prefer gloom to glee, joy is an emotion that lifts our spirits and fuels our inspiration. So imagine just how great it would be if you could be joyful in every aspect of your life; not just on weekends but at work, too. You might enjoy your daily commute, and find working hard feels instead like play time. Such a situation doesn’t have to exist only in your imagination. Based on the practices of the highly innovative and successful software company Menlo Innovations, these blinks will show you how to turn any workplace into a joyful center where employees thrive. In the following blinks, you’ll discover why a software company would support bringing babies to work; what the advantages are of high-speed voice technology; and how wearing a Viking helmet can help you promote openness. Unless you’re the grumpy Scrooge of Dickensian fame, joy is an emotion you crave and enjoy. Being happy and full of life is better than being miserable and gloomy, isn’t it? So why don’t we incorporate more positive feelings – such as joy – into our workplaces? Joy drives people to seek a higher purpose and leave a lasting impact on the world. And joy can be a valuable motivator in the business world, where it manifests as a desire to work on something larger than yourself and belong to a supportive community. You’ll find that joyful people work longer and harder than ever before to achieve such goals. Consider the difference between the Wright brothers and Samuel Pierpont Langley. While both Langley and the Wrights were striving to create the first-ever airplane, their motivations for doing so diverged. Langley wanted fame and fortune; the Wright brothers wanted to experience the joy of flight. And it was the pursuit of joy that inspired the Wright brothers not only to win but to soar! Another benefit of bringing joy to the business world is that joy serves as a base for your company’s culture, which helps unite and shape your team of employees. When the author invites clients to his software company, Menlo Innovations, he asks: If half of his employees express joy for their work and the other half doesn’t, which employees would the client prefer to work with? Of course, the answer is always, the joyful ones. As it turns out, Menlo’s clients implicitly understand that joyful employees are more productive and engaged in their work, which leads to better results. So we’ve learned that joy is a way to reach new, higher goals and that joyful employees create a joy-driven culture. But what does a joyful company actually look like? Keep reading to find out. Would working in a dank, windowless office make you feel joyful? Probably not. The design and layout of your office can have a huge effect on how your employees feel when they’re working. The author observed this firsthand when he redesigned his company offices, creating a large, open space where employees could see each other and work together. This open environment is chock-full of employees, talking and laughing. In fact, it feels more like a lively restaurant than an actual office! Menlo has made sure that its office space would be easy to redesign, too. Electrical wiring is adapted for this purpose and furniture is lightweight, making any move hassle-free. For the author, this flexibility distinguishes the company from typical corporate spaces, where work is fixed and routine. Allowing employees to play around and have fun creates a relaxed but creatively charged environment. Even more so, the ability to rearrange the space helps employees be more productive. At Menlo, employees have total freedom in this regard. Sometimes they move things around to ensure a team is seated together; other times, moving things around is just a way to create change for its own sake. When you change where you sit, you literally change your point of view. Think about it: after spending ages sitting at your desk, mulling a difficult problem, say you get up and go to the kitchen. And then, when you open the fridge, ta-da! The solution comes to you. And that’s exactly why, by allowing staff the freedom to move around, Menlo creates a more productive workplace. Open workplaces also have another benefit, in that they help facilitate communication; which, in turn, promotes joy. This is important, as being able to communicate more directly is a great way of avoiding misunderstandings and unnecessary conflicts in the workplace. Menlo uses a technique called high-speed voice technology (or in non-Menlo speak, “direct communication”). This system provides many benefits. For one, it supports active listening. Since employees can hear many conversations around them in an open workspace, anyone can jump into any discussion if they have something to add, or just want to ask a question. This approach does run against common practice, however. At most companies, arguments are often handled via proxy, such as through another person or by email. In conversations via proxy, it’s easy to become passive-aggressive or to misread the tone of a conversation, which can lead to conflict. Direct conversations help you avoid conflict. Being able to speak directly, and in person, promotes conviviality. Also, since you can see the other person’s body language, it’s easier to understand their true message. Additionally, having conversations allows employees to build relationships, which in turn leads to improved productivity. Employees at Menlo work together in pairs. Each pair is assigned a single computer, which makes clear communication a necessity. This pairing approach also has a learning component. Each member has something to teach their counterpart, and also something to learn. But it doesn’t end there! To ensure relationships are built across the entire team, every week the pairings are rearranged, giving employees the opportunity to form new relationships. Most families have rituals or traditions, such as Sunday dinner and holiday celebrations. We also like to keep artifacts, like photographs, that tell stories about our past. These rituals and artifacts constitute our family culture. The same holds true for business. If you want to promote joy in your company, you have to choose your artifacts and rituals carefully. That’s why Menlo’s leadership created rituals geared to promote an open, joyful culture. Instead of holding ordinary meetings, they have a daily standup at 10 a.m., during which each employee team tells the others what they’re working on. To make the atmosphere more joyful, they pass around a horned Viking helmet. When it’s time for a pair to present, they each grab one horn and hold the helmet between them while sharing. Later in the day, at 3 p.m., the entire staff takes a walk together, a ritual called walkies. This allows employees to stretch their legs and get some air while conversing and building relationships with team members. Additionally, the company relies on a show & tell ritual, which is basically a version of the classic game with a twist. A team that has completed a project watches as a client attempts to explain exactly what the team has done. This ritual keeps clients and Menlo employees on the same wavelength. One more important aspect of Menlo’s culture is the work authorization board. This workboard displays the tasks for which each pair is responsible. This visual artifact plays a major role in reducing conflict by removing ambiguity about who’s doing what. So just as you can get to know a person based on the photos he hangs on his walls, rituals and artifacts in the workplace can reveal and reproduce company values. A joyful company culture is made up of strong, almost familial bonds. This of course begs the question: how should you recruit new members to join your family? The most important thing is to ensure that your interview process aligns with your core values. In other words, it’s far more important to hire based on personal traits and openness to joy than on actual skills. When candidates apply to work at Menlo, they take a tour of the office as part of the interview process. If they appreciate the communal workplace, there’s a stronger chance of a match between employee and company. Of course, that might mean that the company has to pass over some solitude-loving geniuses, but that’s okay. Because for a joyful culture, the whole must be greater than the sum of its parts. Kindergarten skills, or the ability to play well with others, are another important factor of Menlo’s personality-driven interview process. To discover whether candidates have good kindergarten skills, Menlo invites all candidates to a mass interview (dubbed an extreme interview) filled with various interactions with Menlo staff and each other. This process tests the candidates’ ability to joyfully interact with others. This gets to another core component of the hiring process: Let your team take part. At Menlo’s extreme interviews, two candidates work together while one Menlo employee observes. In total, each candidate works in three different pairs with three different employee-observers. And then, at the end of the interview, employees collectively evaluate the candidates. First impressions count, so don’t forget that as you’re hiring! If you aspire to a joyful company culture, that spirit should be the first thing a candidate experiences when walking through the door. Could you experience joy in a pitch-black room if you’re afraid of the dark? Not really. And that’s exactly why creating a safe, comfortable working environment is critical if you want employees to try new things, voice their opinions and experiment freely. If the fear of failing is taken away, employees will take more risks, which will lead to greater innovation. Here’s where feeling safe (as opposed to being safe) becomes a necessity. When people are focused on being safe, they’re likely to be cautious; yet those who already feel safe will have more courage to experiment. At Menlo, employees feel safe because they know failures won’t be criticized. This allows them the freedom to take calculated risks. This practice has led to some interesting innovations, such as Menlo babies. The company decided to see what would happen if an employee who had just had a child brought her into work every day. Having a baby in the office turned out to be a perfect match for the company’s joyful culture. And as an unexpected result, Menlo’s “baby-friendly” culture became a unique selling point when pitching to potential clients. But although experimenting can sometimes lead to noteworthy innovation, it can of course also lead to failure. That’s why it’s important to allow ideas to fail faster, as opposed to letting a failing project drag on, wasting time and money. For instance, Menlo’s Ford Everest project aimed to combine 30 different platforms in a single Web-based system. Because of the project’s scale, no one wanted it to fail; so the company ploughed in more and more money ($400 million in total) to make it work. Yet the project was doomed from the start. In the end, Menlo had to even spend an additional $200 million just to shut the project down. If only the company had simply allowed the endeavor to fail faster, it would have saved considerable time and money. The key message in this book: In business, promoting a joyful company culture, one based on openness and transparency, drives innovation and productivity. In fact, aligning everything you do with joy will make employees happier, thus motivating them to work harder. Actionable advice: Open up your workspace, open up minds.  Tearing down physical walls effectively tears down the walls that can lock in new ideas. So get rid of gray cubicles or unnecessary offices, and let employees design their collective space as to encourage collaboration and open conversation.

It’s no surprise either, considering the amazing power that stories have to totally capture our attention and excite our emotions, transporting us into strange and captivating worlds. But stories aren’t just pleasant ways to pass the time or get a thrill; they’re also valuable tools. In fact, storytelling was among the first and best ways to impart valuable information and motivate behavior. And that’s no less true today than it was during human prehistory. These blinks are about the power of the story as well as the components that make them compelling. Here you’ll learn why and how so many businesses are already using the power of storytelling to motivate your behavior, as well as what you can do to incorporate storytelling into your own life and career. In these blinks, you’ll find out: why some speakers just put you to sleep; why one runner’s injury didn’t stop him from finishing the race; and how to tell a story that appeals to anyone. Question: Why is it that some of the longest-running shows on televisions are soap operas? Answer: People just love a good story. Whether it’s the drama in a soap or a riveting page-turner, we become completely captured by good stories. But it’s not only authors and screenwriters who have profited from the art of storytelling. In fact, a great deal of businesses have as well: Nike, Microsoft, FedEx and Costco each have their own corporate storyteller.  Who exactly are these corporate storytellers and why do these companies hire them? Stories are critical components of corporate messaging towards customers and employees alike. For most of human history, storytelling has been the primary method for imparting knowledge. Before the printing press made possible the mass distribution of written materials, most information was shared via oral tradition in the form of stories. Indeed, storytelling offers some unique advantages over other types of communication: First, anyone can tell and learn from a story. A good story can transfix anyone, regardless of age or education. In addition, stories are memorable. It’s quite difficult to remember an isolated fact or a statistic. However, according to psychologist Jerome Bruner, if these facts are put into a story, we’re 20 times more likely to remember them. Finally, stories can appeal to every type of learner. There are three types of learners: 40 percent of us are visual learners, 40 percent are auditory learners and the remaining 20 percent are kinetic learners. Stories attract all three – a story’s imagery influences visual learners, the vocabulary appeals to auditory learners and the emotions and feelings connect with kinetic learners. As you can see, stories are a great way to impart knowledge, so much so that businesses have incorporated them into their strategies. In the next few blinks, we’ll go into detail about the specific areas of business that can be improved with a story. When was the last time that you had a remarkable – or horrible – customer service experience? Did it motivate you to leave kudos for the customer service representative in the “how are we doing” box? Or maybe leave a scathing review on Yelp? If you’ve ever left a review, then you’ve done that company a favor. In fact, these stories are a great way for consumers to share insights on how to get customer service right. Consider the story of Ray Brook, who was visiting Portland, Oregon for two busy days filled with meetings: Not living in Portland, he needed a car and decided to hire one from National Car Rental. Once he got to the counter he was shocked to discover that his driver’s license had expired a mere few days prior, meaning the company couldn’t legally lend him a vehicle. He was in trouble: how on earth was he going to make it to his meetings? The next day, as he waited on his new license, National Car Rental employees agreed to drive him around – from his meeting to his hotel and then to another meeting. And they even drove him to the DMV to renew his license! Naturally, Brook was astounded by the quality of service they had provided him and so he wrote a letter to the CEO of National, commending their actions. Impressed, the CEO began using this story during speeches to his staff all across America. Brook’s story of staff going the extra mile became the new standard expected of National employees. Indeed, a good customer-service story is useless if no one knows about it. As a leader, you can capture a great opportunity to learn, simply by ensuring that customers have a place to record their experiences. For example, you could create a “story box” on your website, give customers self-addressed envelopes to encourage them to share their stories or even just scour customer review sites to gleam stories about your company. How many businesses promise to “put the customer first” or declare that its employees are “the most important part of the business?” These hollow messages are a dime-a-dozen, and customers and employees alike are well within their minds to consider them utterly meaningless. A company's values and culture are best spread through compelling stories, not vague slogans or hollow promises. We can see a prime example of this from 2011, when the revolution in Egypt took a violent turn and foreigners living in the country began fleeing to the airports. However, due to the instability there, most flights from the country were being cancelled. Amongst those attempting to flee was Rasoul Madadi, an employee of Procter & Gamble (P&G), and his family. Struggling to get out, Madidi called P&G. The company promised to do whatever they could, buying him and his family tickets for five flights in order to ensure that flight cancellations wouldn’t prevent him from leaving. When one of the flights finally took off, the company ensured that Madadi would receive accommodation and supplies upon landing. They really did put him first. Stories like these are worth a million slogans like, “We value our employees.” It shows people a company's true values with actions, not just words. Stories also help employees to understand what is really expected of them. This is crucial, since these expectations sometimes differ from the actual rules. For example, companies may say that they offer flexibility for employees who are expecting children, but people nonetheless often worry that they will end up on the losing side of the deal. Stories are a great way to close the gap and increase employees’ confidence in their company. For instance, P&G shares stories on their websites about new mothers who’ve used and benefitted from the company’s flexible working policies as a way to clearly demonstrate to others that they have nothing to fear from taking advantage of this flexibility. Most of us who work for large companies don’t know our colleagues very well. We might become true friends with one or two coworkers, but we likely won’t get past such shallow topics as “Nasty weather today, huh?” or “Did you see the game last night?” with most of the team. However, as a leader, you want your employees to build relationships. So how can you overcome this obstacle? One way is through stories. Motivating people to share stories with one another can be the best way to build up strong relationships within a team. Take the story of Jamie, for example, who, despite being the head of his team, couldn’t seem to make real friends with anyone at work. Then one day the team had a bonding session, in which they each had to share a story. Jamie used the opportunity to open up about his life, speaking about how his brother who had suffered from bipolar disorder and killed himself. The story left most of his group in tears, and it brought them closer to him. They realized that he was more than just a co-worker: he is a human being, with depth and complexity. His personal story helped transform him from a stranger with whom everyone shared an office into a relatable person. It created a strong bond between him and his team, meaning that he was happier at work and that his team was more willing to work hard for him. Furthermore, stories can also help you build a diverse team. There’s no debate in the business world that diverse teams outperform homogeneous ones, so it’s important to diversify your team’s skills and experiences. Yet, building such a team can be difficult, as some people behave negatively towards others without realizing it. Stories, however, offer members of the team a means to share their discomfort in a way that can help others understand and change their behavior accordingly. Be honest: have you ever read through all the documents that outline the rules and regulations of your company? Chances are, even if you are in C-level management, that you haven’t. So, how do you learn all the rules? Perhaps the most obvious way is trial and error, simply doing what you feel is appropriate and then correcting your behavior after being reprimanded. However, while this may help a few people learn a few things, this method can only provide limited knowledge. After all, how many rules does the average employee actually break? In order to bridge this gap between personal experience and company policy, leaders can use stories as a way to inform employees of what they should and shouldn’t do. For instance, when new P&G employees begin their employment, they are told the story of two workers who abused the company’s free cafeteria service for trainees. Even after having worked for the company for a while, they continued sneaking in for a free lunch. They got away with it for some time; security in the canteen wasn’t very strict and no one had to show identification or prove that they were in training in order to enter. The company simply trusts that only those who are entitled to the service would use it. Yet, in the end their desire to get something for nothing got the better of them. They visited the cafeteria so often that staff eventually became suspicious and called management, who caught the cheaters and had them fired. So what lessons does this story teach? Employees learn, whether they've read the rule book or not, that they won’t get away with taking advantage of the company’s generosity. All it takes is a simple, compelling story to make policy become clear and understandable. Imagine that you are bringing a long, exhausting project to a close, and you want to start slowing down your efforts and moving on to a new, exciting project. Your boss, however, disagrees. What can she do to motivate you to continue and keep giving it your all? She could spout nonsensical motivational phrases about “giving it 110 percent” – or she could tell you an inspiring story. We can draw some inspiration from history by looking at the famous story of the Tanzanian runner John Stephen Akhwari: As Akhwari was running in an Olympic marathon in 1968, he suffered a fall and dislocated his knee. He could have easily given up right then, accepted medical treatment and left for home. But he didn’t. He got back on his feet and, in agony, kept going. An entire hour after the winner had crossed the finish line, Akhwari finally entered the stadium to the cheers of those who had stayed to the end. After finishing, he was asked why he’d kept going. He replied: “My country didn’t send me 5,000 miles to start this race, they sent me 5,000 miles to finish it.” Leaders can use his story, or similar stories, to inspire people to keep going until the work is finished, knowing that people will respect them and admire them for it. Such stories can also help prevent people from jumping ship at the first sign of trouble. Managers can inspire staff to continue onward with stories of companies that faced misfortune, but that persevered and reached success. For example, when P&G launched Pringles, sales were initially good but soon started to slip. While they could have scrapped the project in search of easier profits, they instead kept going. They made some improvements to their recipe based on customer feedback and relaunched the product, making Pringles one of the best-selling chip brands today. Now that you’ve seen just how powerful stories can be, our final blinks will show you what constitutes a good story. At school, we learn that a story needs a beginning, middle and end. In more scientific jargon, you need context, action and the result (CAR). And what’s true for schoolchildren is true for business as well. Let’s start with context: The context stage of a story is crucial – without it, the audience doesn’t know what’s going on. But what do you need to provide context for? A good place to start is where and when your story takes place. This helps the audience discern whether the story is true or hypothetical. You also need to establish who your protagonist is as well as what she wants, and who or what the antagonist is. When you’re establishing context, it’s important that you try your best to ensure that your audience can relate to your story as much as possible. The more the audience members can relate, the more they’ll take notice, which means that you should probably leave out fanciful worlds with superheroes and kings. With everything set up, you can then move on to the action. This is where your hero battles against her enemies who stand in the way of her goals. In your story, this might be an employee battling his boss in order to try out his revolutionary business strategy. Here, you don’t have to overburden your audience with details. You just need to grip them with a good mixture of success and failure for your hero. Finally you’re left with the result of your hero’s actions: the conclusion to your story. Who triumphs in the battle between hero and villain? This is where the audience members will learn the moral of your story: should they follow the hero’s path to victory, or use his story as a precautionary tale? After all of these blinks we still haven’t actually talked about what constitutes a story. No matter what the content of the story actually is, a good story hinges on its ability to evoke the emotions of the audience. However, you don’t want to evoke just any emotions. If you want your audience to become motivated by your story, you’ll have to appeal to the right emotions. For instance, it’s easy to get people teary-eyed when you tell them a heartwarming story about puppies, but this won’t be that useful to you unless you own a pet store. We can take an example from Texas, which in the 1980s was ridden with so-called “litterbugs.” The government tried its best to combat littering by appealing to emotions, publishing advertisements that showcased a Native American weeping at the sight of environmental destruction due to litter. While touching, these ads had no effect. The worst litterers were people with little concern for the environment or minority groups such as Native Americans. So, the government changed directions, this time producing an ad featuring Texas’s greatest sports stars and musicians and connecting littering with damaging Texas itself. This time, they evoked the right emotions from their audience: the litterers were very proud of their state and their heritage, and hearing the anti-littering message from their heroes hit home. Littering in Texas dropped 72 percent in the time immediately after running these ads. But how do you know which emotional connections to make for your stories. Most stories will come from customer feedback, and the easiest place to find this feedback is in customer surveys. P&G used this tactic in 2008 when they asked customers how the economic downturn affected them. They received many replies detailing people’s fears about not being able to pay the bills or maintain their standard of living. So, if they wanted to launch a product that would save people money, for instance, then these stories would have been very effective at evoking the right emotions. You’re at a conference and you feel your eyelids growing heavier and heavier as you listen to a speaker drone for hours. When he finally finishes, how much of the story do you expect to remember? Probably next to nothing. For more memorable storytelling, inject your stories with a bit of surprise. If there is any sort of shocking action in your story, do your best to squeeze it into the beginning. For example, if your story takes place in a turbulent environment – perhaps during a revolution or on Wall Street during a stock-market crash – then use this information when you establish the context. This way, your audience will be transfixed from the very beginning. You can also help your audience remember your story by adding surprise to the end. Surprise at the end sticks because of a brain phenomenon called memory consolidation: whenever we experience something, our memories aren’t formed immediately, but in the moments following. During memory consolidation, it’s possible to influence a memory’s stickiness by attaching memories to certain stimuli. One such stimuli is adrenaline, which is released when the body experiences a rush, often brought on by shock or surprise. Thus, ending your story with a surprise will help your audience members retain their memory of the story. Sometimes putting surprises in the right places requires a little creativity regarding how you structure the story. Take this story about never giving up, for example: At 22 he lost his job. At 25 he ran for state parliament, only to be defeated. Then, at 34 he aimed for a seat in congress, and failed again. At 45 he ran for the senate, was defeated and then he tried again at 49 but lost again. But two years later all this failures were forgotten when he became immortalized as our sixteenth President, Abraham Lincoln. In this case, by withholding the name, we can create a straightforward story with a memorable surprise twist.

A society where some people seem to have lots of power to do what they want and others seem to have no self-determination at all? Where, exactly, do these hierarchies come from? Leaders Eat Last examines these questions by contrasting our modern societies – including their many technological advances and complex systems that can lead us to disarray – with the kinds of societies we would have lived in thousands of years ago. In doing so, we find that this division into “leaders” and “followers” is merely a natural consequence of our biology, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that all leaders are good. So what is it that makes a leader worth following? Find out the answer to this question and more by reading these blinks. Furthermore, these blinks will show you why hotel employees sacrificed their lives for their guests, why giving your employees free reign over company resources might actually be the responsible thing to do, that, given the right conditions, even you might electrocute someone, that you’re probably an addict without even knowing it and how to be a true leader. Have you ever wondered how societies were divided into leaders and followers? The answer is actually quite simple: biology. It all comes down to hormones, which evolved over eons to help us survive by controlling our emotions and moderating our behavior, and which affect us just as much today as they did tens of thousands of years ago. The hormone dopamine rewards us with happy excitement whenever we complete a task, such as finding something we’ve been searching for or reaching our weight-loss goals. In addition, serotonin and oxytocin affect our social lives by helping us form relationships with other people. And then there are endorphins, which disguise exhaustion and pain as physical pleasure. Endorphins are the reason why we leave the gym aglow after a hard day of training and just can’t wait to go back for more. Ten thousand years ago, endorphins would have helped a village’s hunters continue the hunt and bring back meat to their hungry families despite their physical exhaustion. Today, they inspire professional athletes, such as runners, to achieve their peak performance. In addition to helping us survive, hormone-driven behavior is also responsible for creating the basic template for social hierarchy. In hunter-gatherer societies, for example, a rush of endorphins allowed hunters to push for miles and miles in order to secure meat for the community, which in turn earned them the privileges of higher status. Weaker individuals, who for one reason or another couldn’t participate in the hunt, had to accept less prestigious roles, such as gathering fruits. This distinction between the “strong” and the “weak” was the first step on the path towards social hierarchy. Yet, while certainly being responsible for these class distinctions, hormones also add cohesion to these hierarchical structures by giving the weaker individuals a serotonin- or oxytocin-based warm feeling towards one another as well as the leader, rather than destructive stings of jealousy. When it comes to survival, living in a group offers many perks, the most important of which being that we don’t have to face threats alone. This provides us with a feeling of safety that allows us to concentrate on making progress rather than avoiding threats. In prehistoric times, we found danger around every corner: we had to protect ourselves from predators, other people and diseases, while simultaneously trying to secure food and shelter. Living in a group, however, allows us to divvy up the tasks necessary for self-preservation, thus enabling us to concentrate on other specific projects, such as fashioning better tools. These, in turn, help us progress as societies. As such, our brains have evolved to prioritize feeling safe, which is why we now do strange things like stay in jobs we hate simply because they make us feel secure. But safety doesn’t just come out of nowhere: it is a group’s leaders who draw a circle of safety around their community members. This circle of safety describes a group of people who share common values and beliefs, and strive to protect one another from threats. Within this circle, members can trust each other and thus pool their resources in order to progress. But it is the leader who determines just how far the circle extends. For example, Bob Chapman altered the course of management history at HayssenSandiacre by radically expanding the circle of safety, allowing all employees free access to company goods and services. Working in a safe and trusting environment created a bond between the company’s employees, who even began helping each other even in times of personal crisis. Some even transferred their own paid vacation days to those in need. Given that living in a group makes us feel safe today just as it did when we lived in caves, we also need a leader who can help us pool our resources and achieve progress. When we imagine a CEO, we often picture someone who seals the deals and sends profits through the roof. However, successfully running a company has as much to do with creating the culture as it does with managing finances. This is because a company is more than merely the sum of its buildings, investors and workforce. It also embodies a culture that dictates how employees approach various problems, treat customers, and prioritize values. And because leaders, such as CEOs, determine how the company is run, they also craft its culture. We can learn a bit about how this works by looking at the history of Goldman Sachs: between 1970 and 1990, the company operated under the motto “long-term greedy,” showing a willingness to stand by clients even if that meant short-term financial losses. Since the 1990s, however, CEO Lloyd C. Blankfein and company president Gary D. Cohn shifted the company’s focus to short-term profits, even when they come at the client’s expense. Company culture doesn’t just affect leadership – it stretches all the way down the hierarchy by setting the standards that employees have to meet in order to get hired and ultimately stay with the company. One extraordinary example of how company culture influences staff can be found in the bravery of the employees at the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel, which insists that the guests’ interests come before those of the company’s. In 2008, the hotel was attacked by terrorists, and a number of the employees who had fled actually returned to help the guests, some even forming human shields to protect fleeing hotel visitors! Of all the people who were lost that day, half were hotel staff. Now that we’ve learned about how leadership looks, the following blinks will deal with the drastic effects of bad leadership. Being in a leadership role doesn’t necessarily mean you’re a force of good. When the bond between the leaders and the team is somehow severed, the consequences can be horrific. In essence, this is because responsibility is actually about caring for other people; when we’re removed from the people for whom we are responsible, we’re less cautious about the damage we cause. Our feeling of responsibility comes from our empathy, the ability to put ourselves in someone else’s shoes. Without empathy, we risk becoming emotionally removed from decisions that affect others. And if we add physical distance to the mix, it leads to abstraction, where the consequences of our actions seem less real than they otherwise would. We see evidence of abstraction in the Milgram Experiment, in which one group of volunteers, called Teachers, were told to push buttons that would inflict electric shocks of increasing intensity – from a mild sting to a potentially lethal jolt – on other participants, called Learners. Unbeknownst to the Teachers, the Learners were all actors who weren’t actually being shocked. While many participants expressed great discomfort at inflicting apparent harm onto the Learners, Milgram found that the less proximity a Teacher had to a Learner, the more likely they were to continue the experiment. In fact, more than half the participants of one particular group, who could neither see nor hear the writhing and screams of agony from the Learners, eventually administered what would have been deadly voltage! When abstraction occurs, we begin to prioritize our interests over other people’s, which can lead us to actively make decisions at others’ expense. Consider the maiden voyage of the Titanic, for example. To the management, the passenger’s lives were mere abstractions, which is why they decided to cut the cost of additional lifeboats. Although additional lifeboats wouldn’t have prevented the Titanic from sinking, this kind of callous decision-making contributed to many unnecessary deaths. As we’ve already seen, being part of a group offers us a feeling of safety and opportunity for progress. Conversely, feeling alone and threatened makes us selfish and causes us to dehumanize others. We see this easily when we examine the baby boomers, or the generation born after World War II. Having grown up spoiled by a thriving economy and outnumbering their parents’ generation, they became more selfish than their parents. In addition, the natural instinct for the younger generation to oppose the values of the previous one made the baby boomers more self-centered and critical of authority than their parents, who had survived the war by pulling together. This preference for self-centered behavior over solidarity can be seen in how the baby boomers welcomed President Ronald Reagan’s handling of the air traffic controllers’ strike in 1981. Reagan fired 11,000 striking workers, siding with companies who opposed the air traffic controllers’ demands for better payment and prioritized profits over the workers’ well-being. And once we prioritize the pursuit of profits over all else, it can lead to the dehumanization of others. This is due, in part, to the technology that makes global business possible. Because businesses operate on such an enormous scale, it’s easier to think of people as abstractions, such as consumers, shareholders or expenses. We’re therefore more likely to dehumanize others, i.e., to see them as tools that fulfill a specific purpose, than we are to treat them as living, breathing people with their own wants and needs. Think, for example, of the 2009 salmonella outbreak that took the lives of nine people and contaminated hundreds more. How did this outbreak occur? The Peanut Corporation of America delivered contaminated peanuts to more than three hundred companies, thus allowing the disease to spread. The truly horrifying part is that this was no accident: the PCA management knowingly shipped contaminated peanuts just so it could maintain its cash flow. What do you think of when you hear the word “addiction”? Probably things like alcohol or drugs. It may surprise you, but you can also be addicted to performance. This addiction is intimately tied to our biology. Whereas the release of dopamine was once linked directly to our survival, nowadays it’s tied to our job performance, rewarding us when we achieve better and faster performance. Many companies looking to increase their production welcome this, all too easily forgetting the stability provided by long-term goals. Consider the company America Online. The part of their staff responsible for customer acquisition came up with offers for “free” hours as a way to entice new customers. These employees were encouraged to focus on that singular area of performance, i.e., get as many people signed up as possible, and they eventually started making offers of 1,000 free hours per month! Although they were doing what they were told, they ended up costing the company a lot of money by not taking long-term consequences into account. In addition, the fact that we’re surrounded by all this amazing technology has shifted our attention from long-lasting value to getting a quick “buzz.” Taking a look at any internet-based human rights campaign can show us why: When we “like” some human rights campaign – or anything, really – on Facebook, it triggers a dopamine response that gives us a rush of happiness for having completed a task. In order to prevent ourselves from becoming addicted to these little bursts of dopamine, we need to balance them out with a serotonin- and oxytocin-driven sacrifice, i.e., actually going somewhere to volunteer or building relationships with real people. The problem is that technology makes it easier and easier to just click “like,” and actual volunteer work stays just as hard as it always was. As a result, we become addicted to the “quick fix.” So now we know what defines bad leadership. These final blinks will not only discuss what it takes to be a leader, but to be a leader worth following. What do you think of when you imagine a good leader? You probably think about their specific skills and expertise that help them excel at what they do. In actuality, it all comes down to integrity and the ability to bond with others. We need to be able to trust our leaders, which means they must have integrity. We all know that leaders are only human, and we therefore don’t expect them to be perfect. What we do expect, however, is that they’re honest and forthcoming about their mistakes and take responsibility for them. The feeling of safety that is so vital to the group is built slowly over time upon a foundation of honesty and trust. A leader thus has an opportunity to set an example to others with her integrity. For example, in 2009, the Ralph Lauren Corporation learned that its Argentine branch had been involved in bribery. Rather than staging an elaborate cover-up, the leaders of the company instead informed the American authorities and even offered to aid them in the investigation. Although this course of action meant that the company had to pay over a million dollars in penalties, it was able to keep its integrity, and thus the trust of their customers and employees. Furthermore, once leaders have earned the trust of their group, they must keep that trust by bonding with others. Whether with their employees, customers, colleagues or rivals, it’s important for a leader to maintain real connections in order to stay honest and focus on the needs of others. We can see how a lack of bonding can affect leadership by looking at the US Congress. Until the 1990s, most congressmen and -women lived in Washington and thus communicated daily, which resulted in laws built upon close cooperation. Today, however, most members of Congress live elsewhere, and fly to Washington for a few days a week. The result? Some of the lowest approval ratings in congressional history! When you head to the voting booth to vote for your country’s next leader, what are some of the things you consider? What sort of personal qualities do you look for? What makes them a leader and not a “regular person”? Essentially, a leader forges a vision for the future that the entire group feels inspired to fulfill. Although every group member has individual goals, the group as a whole needs purpose in order to remain cohesive, and that purpose comes from the leader’s vision. Think of Bill Gates, for example. His goal wasn’t to earn billions of dollars, or even to build a great company. His dream was to put a computer on every desk. It is precisely this vision that ensures that Microsoft doesn’t lose itself in the abundance of profits and possibilities, and instead remains a major force on the market. Counterintuitively, by providing a vision for the future, leaders actually serve the led, and not the other way around. Indeed, true leaders understand that their duty is to serve the people that follow them. Although leaders do enjoy certain privileges, these come at the cost of an enormous responsibility to the people they lead. In times of crisis, a true leader will use all his personal resources for the good of the community. This principle takes on a quite literal form in the Marine Corps, where the most senior members always receive their meal last. This is neither an agreement nor an order, but a statement: leaders eat last. Only once they are able to put their own needs last can they say that they’ve earned their status as leaders. The true meaning of the term “leader” can be found within the word itself: you must lead people in a certain direction, showing them the path and giving them a purpose to walk on it. And on that path, the leaders need to follow last in line to ensure that every member of the group makes it to the end. The key message in this book: True leaders prioritize the needs of the group over their own, and thus ensure that the group as a whole progresses. Because a leader’s vision is a cause for action, it’s important to ensure that these leaders are a force for good. Remember: Your employees are your family. When you turn to your employees, view them as family members instead of subordinates. Set a vision. If you wonder how to manage your company, try to set a vision for the future, instead of concentrating on short-term goals.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

So what had gone wrong? The answer is simple: they failed to adapt to the needs of a changing world. Even though traditional, Western innovation practices have proven successful, many Western companies still have a long way to go when it comes to creating truly adaptable innovation processes. These strategies are vital to growth and survival in a global, and rapidly changing, market. So how do you do it? Enter jugaad innovation. Jugaad is a Hindi word meaning an ingenious and clever improvisation. As these blinks will show you, jugaad innovators are highly adaptable, good at doing more with less, and great at challenging entrenched notions and assumptions about business. In these blinks, you’ll learn why Western innovation can act as a straitjacket; why so many CEOs of Western companies feel threatened by social media; and why you should never forget the margins. As North American and European economies expanded during the 20th century, Western corporations became characterized by ever-increasing institutionalization. With dedicated research and development (R&D) departments and standardized business processes, emphasis was consistently placed on managing innovation. While this structured approach has indeed proven successful, it’s not particularly sustainable. Not only are institutionalized methods expensive and a drain on resources, they also lack flexibility and are insular to the point of elitism. Consider “Six Sigma,” the leading dogma for major Fortune 500 firms such as Boeing and General Electric. An integrated set of management techniques, Six Sigma is designed to reduce defects and increase efficiency in production. Six Sigma was pioneered by Motorola in 1986, and although it works wonders in limiting production mistakes – ensuring 99.99966 percent of products will be manufactured defect-free –  it hardly allows any room for change or development. In an age of diversifying customer groups and rapid technological shifts, this is a significant drawback. Six Sigma and other standardized approaches also serve to stifle novel strategies put forth by a company’s more enterprising employees, even when these unconventional methods can solve business problems in ways that traditional approaches cannot. The reality is that many Western firms are ill-equipped to survive, let alone innovate, in the complex market environment of the future. Scarcity, diversity, hyperconnectivity and breakneck globalization all present never-before-seen challenges to businesses. Hierarchical communication, linear planning and insular approaches to innovation suggest that these companies will struggle to adapt to major trends, such as increasing social media use. Facebook, for example, has become a brainstorming center for many young employees, as one firm revealed to the authors. However, the company admitted that they simply couldn’t manage to funnel these ideas back into its corporate R&D system. While many organizations are at a loss as to how to incorporate future challenges into their structure, there is a solution. It’s called jugaad innovation, and it’s simple, yet effective. Learn more in the following blinks! So what is jugaad innovation? At the heart of this method is awareness: recognizing constraints and making them work for you. A jugaad innovator will respond quickly to what he sees not as obstacles, but opportunities.  One early jugaad innovator was Tulsi Tanti. After founding a textile unit, he, like many other Indian entrepreneurs, struggled with an expensive and unreliable energy supply. After a period of trial and error, Tanti discovered a dependable, sustainable and affordable power source: wind turbines. After the initial costs of setting up the turbines were recovered, Tanti was able to fuel his business for free. And he didn’t stop there. Tanti realized that it wasn’t just his company that could benefit from affordable alternative energy – there was a growing global demand for sustainable power sources, so he founded a company to meet it: Suzlon Energy. Today, Suzlon Energy, which was established in 1995, is the world’s fifth-largest wind energy supplier. The company is active in over 30 countries across six continents, and employs 13,000 people. A proactive problem-solving attitude like Tanti’s would serve many Western firms well as they face new challenges. For example, many Fortune 500 CEOs felt threatened by the explosion of social media networks and their potential influence – they are a powerful tool that can spread rumors, damage brands and ruin, in a matter of hours, reputations that took years to build. In short, social media is seen as a threat to a stable reputation. Procter & Gamble, however, saw the opportunities provided by social media. As early as 2000, the company embraced emerging tools as a new way to engage with customers. Instead of using their traditional R&D teams to test new products on expensive, time-consuming focus groups, they began using social media tools to test dozens of new product ideas with customers online, and even utilized social media to turn satisfied customers into word-of-mouth marketers. Every company should learn to never stand still, and always be ready to try new things. Of course, that’s easier said than done! The downfall of many Western firms is unfortunately their inability to be flexible. They tend to have a profound aversion to risk, and become complacent in their business practices. Companies take past successes and older structures as “tried and true” models and, in doing so, close themselves off to the possibility of new and innovative solutions. One example of this is Kodak. Although Kodak had developed digital photography technology earlier than some of its competitors, it saw the new world of digital cameras as a threat to its highly profitable main business: film. Particularly because Kodak enjoyed the lion’s share of the film market, the company hesitated; as a result, it was easily overtaken by its competitors in the digital photography sector. As Malcolm Gladwell points out in Outliers, invention is by its very nature a disorderly process, filled with deviant behavior and ideas that drive game-changing innovation. Acting flexibly entails working through conditions of diversity, volatility and unpredictability by questioning widely held industry assumptions and improvising solutions. Dr. V. Mohan, a globally renowned diabetes expert, runs a mobile telemedicine clinic in India that services some of the country’s most remote villages. Dr. Mohan and other doctors assist their patients from their offices in Chennai using video monitors, while direct care is provided by a network of primarily urban doctors who travel in a van equipped with telemedicine technologies, which allow for diagnostic tests. Mohan challenged the accepted notion of patients going to doctors. Instead of a doctor’s office, he thought of using a van and “commuting” remotely through video feed. To access his staff through cost-effective communication capabilities, he partnered with the Indian Space Research Organisation. This jugaad innovator was effectively able to turn the tables, and bring doctors to their patients. Westerners tend to view products and services for marginalized segments as a social contribution, and not a profitable venture. But in fact, marginalized segments can represent a business opportunity in themselves! Unfortunately, deeply entrenched Western business models can only adapt half-heartedly to serve those at the margins. This is also a result of Western companies’ short-term outlook: their fixation on quarterly performance makes them less likely to invest the time and resources needed to design business models that can target marginal segments. They feel that the return on such investments is unlikely to materialize for a number of years.   But focusing on marginalized target groups makes sense from both an ethical and a business standpoint. Underdeveloped infrastructure, ineffective government and accelerated population growth have hampered access to basic services like healthcare, education and energy for millions of people throughout Africa, India and Latin America. By the same token, however, such widespread scarcity implies that millions of excluded citizens are also millions of potential customers.   Dr. Rana Kapoor recognized this, and quit his job at a multinational company in 2004 to start an inclusive bank serving the financial needs of a broad range of consumers. His driving force was the belief that banks should serve the 600 million Indians who at the time had no access to a bank. He thus established YES BANK. By including marginalized groups into his business model, Kapoor was able to give back to the community, and not without making a financial profit. YES BANK earns two percent over its cost of lending, whereas most banks earn between one and one and a half percent. Today YES BANK is India’s fifth-largest private bank. We’ve seen that jugaad innovators are good at thinking on their feet, always willing to try new things and challenge the status quo. But being a jugaad innovator doesn’t necessarily mean tearing down the entire system of Western innovation. Instead, it’s a matter of balance. Jugaad innovation is most effective when integrated into traditional innovation models within complex environments that face rapid changes. So, companies must discern when jugaad innovation can best be put to use. Jugaad works best in highly volatile settings, where product lifecycles are short, demographic patterns are shifting and where competition, as well as government regulations, are unpredictable. Fast-paced industries that are in constant flux require flexible thinking and agility, and it is here that jugaad can deliver.   Jugaad methods also excel in settings where industries are hungry for resources, and in sectors that are in their early stages of development. In these situations, market mechanisms and industry standards have to be established. Such contexts give innovators the chance to make the most out of very little, and seek opportunity in the face of many obstacles. So how can you get your company started with jugaad methods? As a leader, you’ll need to be able to prioritize which jugaad principles are the most applicable to your firm. For instance, a premium retailer selling luxury items might not consider the jugaad principle of “achieving more with less,” that is, seeing opportunity in adversity, or “including the margin” to be very relevant; however, “keeping it simple” could be crucial to streamlining service experience for high-end customers. On the other hand, consumer product suppliers like Procter & Gamble or Whirlpool might choose to do more with less by creating new frugal products for customers with diminishing purchasing power. The key message in this book: Jugaad thinking is driven by flexibility, seeing opportunity in adversity and embracing marginalized consumer bases. When these principles are combined with traditional Western methods, companies will discover newfound agility, resourcefulness and resilience, allowing their business to stay competitive in an ever-shifting market.    Suggested further reading: The Innovator’s Dilemma by Clayton M. Christensen The Innovator’s Dilemma explains why so many well-managed and well-established companies fail dismally when faced with disruptive technologies and the emerging markets they create. Through historical examples, Christensen explains why it is precisely these “good” management companies that leave big players so vulnerable. Got feedback?

Maxwell","summary":"The world is changing more rapidly than ever. This means two things for leadership. First, it means that leaders are needed more than ever. Sure, in times of stability we can survive with just managers. But when facing the unknown, we need strong leaders to guide us through uncertainty. Second, a changing world means that leaders themselves need to stay agile. Today’s secret to enduring success as a leader is the ability to be nimble and agile, and to leadershift: to make leadership changes that will boost not just the leader’s growth, but that of his or her organization. These blinks will take you through the personal leadershifts the author, John C. Maxwell, has made throughout his career that have helped him make a positive impact on his organizations and on the world. In these blinks, you’ll learn what dancing the tango has to do with leadership; why focusing on growth is more important than hitting your goals; and how a modest farmer called Claude helped Maxwell understand influence. Too many would-be leaders, like Maxwell himself early in his career, think mostly of themselves. Focused on their own goals and aspirations, they don’t realize that being a leader is not about what you can do for yourself; it’s about what you can do for others. To be a true leader, you need to make the mind-set shift from me to we. A great way to think of this is in terms of an orchestra. Many would-be leaders are stuck in the mind-set of the soloist – the elite performer whom everyone else serves. True leaders behave more like the conductor, focusing on how they can help everyone else produce a great result. After all, as South Korean cellist-turned-conductor Han-Na Chang says, conducting offers the opportunity to draw limitless potential from an entire group of people. Key to making the shift from soloist to conductor is ensuring that you truly understand the people around you. One evening in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where Maxwell was speaking on leadership, he was invited to watch two hundred people dance the tango, in perfect rhythm and harmony. His host explained that the secret to the exquisite perfection on show was for each dance pair’s leader truly to understand his partner; to be able to lead effectively, you need to know what it’s like to be led. Well, the trust, cooperation and mutual understanding required to make the tango look beautiful are just as important in the world of work. So just like any good conductor or tango lead, you should be focused on helping others to shine. You can do this by making sure you have the right attitude toward your people and your relationship to them. Center your leadership around their needs. Listen to them first, before you expect them to listen to you. Work out what your people do well, and compliment them on it. If you set out a big picture for your organization, make sure they are in it. And don’t just tell them your vision – invite them to help you achieve it. These actions are simple. But they’ll only work if they’re backed with an intentionality that says, “My focus is to help others shine.” And none of this is to say that you shouldn’t focus on your own growth. You just need to do that in the right way. Let’s take a look at what that right way is. When Maxwell was a young church leader in a small town in Ohio, he set himself a goal of making his church the largest in the state. He doubled the size of his congregation in a single year. And by 1975, his church was recognized as the fastest-growing in Ohio. But after celebrating, he started to reflect on his achievements. And what he realized was that the personal growth he had experienced along the way – his experience and understanding of leadership – was much more important than hitting his numerical goal of growing church membership. That led to another key leadershift: from a goal mindset to a growth mind-set. A goal mind-set emphasizes achievement and status, whereas a growth mind-set values development and stretching oneself. A goal mind-set prioritizes hitting a target and asking how long it will it take to get there, whereas growth mind-sets simply ask, “How far can I take this?” If you do adopt a growth mind-set, you may be surprised by the results you achieve. When Maxwell was younger, he met Elmer Towns, a Liberty University professor and someone he admired. He discovered that Towns had sold 110,000 books, and decided that selling that many copies of his own books would be his goal. But in time, his shift from goals to growth occurred, and he focused instead on simply becoming a better writer, and not worrying about sales. Years later, his publisher presented him with a crystal trophy engraved with the words “one million books sold.” It turned out that by focusing on growth, he had achieved far more than he would ever have set for himself as a goal. The key to embracing a growth mind-set is to have a teachable spirit. That means not just saying you want to learn, but taking practical steps to do so. Think of it like gardening: just wanting your garden to grow into something beautiful won’t achieve anything. You need to plan, prepare and work at cultivating it. So each day, recognize that opportunities to learn and grow are there, whatever you are doing and whoever you are with. Stay curious, and be intentional about learning. And make sure you are surrounded by other people with a growth mind-set. Elmer Towns, who became a mentor to Maxwell taught him something he called the hot-poker principle. Likening people with a growth mind-set to fire, he’d say that if you can keep your poker near the fire, it stays hot. Take it away, and after a while, it grows cold. Stay close to the fire. You probably know one or two supposed leaders who are self-focused. The question at the forefront of their minds is, “How high up the ladder can I climb?” True leaders, however, make the shift from climbing up the ladder themselves to thinking about how they can build ladders for others. Now, it’s certainly true that climbing the ladder successfully yourself is a prerequisite if you want to help others do the same. A good rule of thumb, according to Maxwell, is to aim to be in the top ten percent of your chosen field. That’s the magic zone in which you’ll stand apart from the rest. Get to that top ten percent, and you can safely assume that you have a lot to offer others. And that’s the best way to look at your success – as a great resource to use to help others. As Kevin Myers, leader of 12Stone, a Wesleyan church based in the US state of Georgia, says, true leaders want more for their people than they want from them. So how can you build those ladders for others to climb? Well, if you’ve hit that magic top ten percent, then think about mentoring. The first thing to do is decide whom to mentor. Think carefully. Time is limited, so if you can only invest in one or two people, they’d better be the right ones. To ensure you choose wisely, ask yourself a few key questions. First, are these people just hopeful, or are they truly hungry for knowledge and learning? There are plenty of people in the world who hope for better things, but only a few who are hungry for it, who don’t simply say, “There should be a way,” but rather, “I’ll find a way.” Invest in these people. Second, ask yourself whether your candidate has true leadership potential. That’s because a leader will influence many other people. So investing in shaping their future has a wider impact than if you mentored a follower. Once you’ve selected your mentee, what should you offer that person? Well, any good mentor offers bite-sized truths distilled from the complexity of life, and options and considerations for the future. But as we’ll see, it isn’t enough for a leader simply to tell people what to do. Maxwell witnessed the benefits of leadershifting from directing people to connecting with them when he visited the locker room of the University of Tennessee Lady Volunteers basketball team, coached by Pat Summitt, a legendarily successful coach. When the players came in at half time, instead of talking to Summitt straight away, they huddled around a whiteboard on which were written three questions: What did we do right? What did we do wrong? and What should we change? Only after the team had discussed and agreed upon its answers did Summitt come and talk to them. She heard them out, reflected on their answers and made a few observations before sending them out onto the court for the second half of the game. Too many leaders lead based on assumptions, Summit told Maxwell. Instead of assuming where her players were mentally and simply telling them what to do, Summit preferred truly to understand them by asking questions and listening to them. Summit had made a leadershift to leadership based on connection, not direction – leadership that embraced collaboration rather than authority, and listening rather than talking. If you want to take the same step, you need to do the same. So learn to listen well. Maxwell spends a great deal of time in meetings, and if you are a leader, you probably do, too. So try out what Maxwell does. Every time you meet with someone, take out a pad to write notes. And at the top of that pad, write a big L, standing for “Listen.” That will act as a reminder that when you meet with people as a leader, your job is less to talk than to listen. If you really want to improve your listening, tackle it with your growth mind-set. Be brave enough to ask your colleagues – or friends or family members – how good a listener you are, on a one-to-ten scale. Pay attention to their answers, and act on them. And ask them to let you know any time they feel you aren’t listening to them in the future. Leading with connection is better for everybody. It leads to better relationships, better communication and a two-way flow of ideas. Embrace this leadershift, and you’ll soon start to see results flow. Now let’s consider another attitude shift: how to embrace diversity. When Maxwell was a young man, in Circleville, Ohio, there was absolutely nothing diverse about his environment. His community was almost completely white. The leaders in his protestant church were white men. They looked alike, and they acted alike. As a young pastor, conformity to tradition was drilled into him. But over time, he came to realize that the most important lessons and insights often come from outside your own group. He learned this from his first discussions with a Catholic priest, who reinforced Maxwell’s faith, despite coming from a different denomination; and, later in life, from his move to Atlanta, a city rich in African-American culture and far removed from Circleville. Similarly, teams are more effective and valuable when they embrace diversity, because diversity brings insight and perspective that can fill the knowledge gap. As a leader, you can’t know everything. You rely on your team to fill in those gaps, and it can do so most effectively when it brings different perspectives to the table. If you need convincing, why not look to some of history’s great leaders? Abraham Lincoln built his cabinet from a very diverse group for that time. Its members were sworn political rivals, not allies. But the tough demands of the civil war required the skills of the best thinkers and diversity of perspective, not homogenous group thinking, if the Union was to be a success. Or look to Winston Churchill, Great Britain’s masterful wartime leader, who brought the leader of the opposition, Clement Attlee, into his cabinet and making Attlee instrumental in strategy meetings in his underground London bunker. If you’d like to bring more diversity into your life, first take a critical look at your friendship and professional circles. If you are like most Americans, they likely reflect your age, social background and skin color. Cheryl Moses, founder of Urban MediaMakers, an organization in Atlanta dedicated to promoting diversity in the media-arts industry, was so struck by reading a study that stated that 75 percent of white Americans had no non-white friends that she decided to host an event called “Come Meet a Black Person,” focused on starting more diverse conversations and connections. So if looking at your friends and contacts is a little too much like looking in the mirror, make an effort to get to know and to learn from people of different races, ages and political persuasions from you. You may be surprised by how refreshing it is to be surrounded by people with new, interesting and different ways of thinking from yours. As Maxwell often says, leadership is influence. But where does a leader’s influence come from? Well, in his first weeks as pastor of a small church in Indiana, fresh out of college, Maxwell learned that influence doesn’t come from the position you hold. By the rules of the church, he was its leader. But as his first meeting of the church’s board kicked off, a respected farmer and church member, Claude, took command. Claude asked Maxwell to open the meeting with a prayer, and Maxwell then said almost nothing until Claude politely asked him for a closing prayer at the end of the meeting. It was a tough, early lesson that titles do not equate to leadership. So Maxwell started thinking about what gave Claude influence. He wasn’t particularly rich, well-educated or impressive in any obvious way. But he had moral authority as a good, honest, fair and hardworking man who had lived these values with consistency for decades. Claude would never have called himself a leader, but he was. Every inch. But what are the qualities inherent in moral authority? Well, integrity – the ability to align your actions with your words and live your values consistently – is important. Integrity makes you dependable and trustworthy – followable, in other words – in the eyes of your team because they know that you will do what you say you will, and that your actions are rooted in strong moral values. When we look at a moral hero like the late Nelson Mandela, we see someone we can rely on to behave in a way that is in line with his values, time and time again. Also important is courage. That’s because acting with courage allows not just you but those around you to achieve their full potential as well. You probably know the biblical story of the Israelite David and his defeat of the Philistine giant Goliath. What you may not know is that while David stepped out to meet the giant, the rest of the army of Israel, including its king, was hiding in fear. But David’s heroic courage inspired his fellow Israelites to find their own. With the giant slain, they stepped out of their fear and defeated the Philistines. Combine courage with integrity, and you’ll be a leader people will be happy to follow, whatever the destination. According to a famous proverb, in the Middle Ages, a passerby came across three craftsmen at work and paused to ask them what they were doing. The first said that he was laying stones, the second that he was building a wall. The third? He replied, with a sense of pride, that he was creating a magnificent cathedral. Some people do a job. Others have careers. And still, others are lucky enough to have found their callings in life. The members of this last group are the lucky ones, who have found something greater than themselves to pursue. As Presbyterian author and minister Frederick Buechner wrote in his 1973 book Wishful Thinking, they have found a place where their deep gladness intersects with one of the world’s deep needs.   Wouldn’t you too like to discover a calling and a richer way forward in life, with a clear reason and purpose for living? Well, there’s no reason why you can’t. If you understand what a calling is, you will be well-placed to find your own. The first thing to know about a calling is that it matches who you are. No one ever got called to something not suited to them. So ask yourself: Is there one thing that you could do for hours on end, that you would happily do for the rest of your life, and that can make a positive difference to others? If so, that might just be your calling. The second thing is that your calling will be something you are passionate about. Maxwell was a fan of the advice of Harold Thurman, the famous African-American philosopher and civil rights leader. Thurman advised people not to ask what the world needs, but to ask what makes them come alive. Because what the world needs is people who are truly alive. But remember that a calling isn’t just about you. The significance of a life dominated by a calling, and not just a career or a job, comes from giving, thinking and serving beyond yourself. Live without a calling, and you are likely to feel a nagging anxiety that your life has not achieved its true meaning. Find it, and everything changes. Nothing else in life is as satisfying. Why do you think so many celebrities champion causes? They are pursuing the richness of life that can only come from a calling. Make the leadershift from career to calling, and a fulfilled life lies ahead of you. The key message in these blinks: The best leaders change and adapt. They leadershift – that is, they make leadership changes that boost both their own and their organization’s growth. They focus not just on directing but on connecting with their teams, and they pursue not just short-term goals and career moves, but deep personal growth, moral authority and their true calling in life.  Actionable advice: File away everything you learn.  To maintain your personal growth and learning, file away whatever you learn. Whenever Maxwell reads an article of interest, he clips it and files it away, arranged by theme. The same goes for quotations. Do the same, and you’ll always have access to the knowledge you’ve acquired and easily be able to reinforce your learning. You could even write a note about these blinks and file them away right now.

Many of these books are speculative and/or consist of scattered anecdotes. Readers seeking a more empirically-grounded, systematic approach to understanding leadership will find relief in these blinks. Based on detailed biographies of four of the most transformational presidents in US history, these blinks identify some key factors in the development of leadership. By comparing and contrasting Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson, we’ll see the similarities and differences between their paths to the White House. This, in turn, will allow us to discern what is and isn’t required for someone to become a great leader. Along the way, we’ll find answers to some of the crucial questions of leadership studies: Are great leaders made, or do they make themselves – and if so, how? In these blinks, you’ll learn how reaching out to his former archrivals helped Lincoln’s success in the Civil War; how purpose can explain Lyndon Johnson’s greatest achievements and failures; the value of undergoing a personal crisis to becoming a great leader. If great leaders were just the products of their circumstances, then we might expect their backstories to share certain key features. But when we look at the lives of the transformational presidents, we see they come from dramatically different backgrounds. Born to an illiterate father who eked out a living on one dirt farm after another, Lincoln grew up in the backwoods of Illinois in a cabin that was initially doorless, floorless and bedless. When he was about nine years old, his father disenrolled him from school so he could work on the farm. Lincoln then had to educate himself. He walked long distances across the countryside to borrow books from people, then read them in his few spare moments. He did this without external support; indeed, if he was caught reading when he was supposed to be working, his father would sometimes beat him and destroy his books. Upon entering adulthood, Lincoln was basically a nobody. Striking out from home to make a fresh start in life, he settled in the town of New Salem, Illinois. Because of his height and shabby appearance, the townsfolk regarded the newcomer as a bit of a freak. Through his friendliness and good deeds, like chopping wood for widows, he eventually won them over, but it took months of building relationships to earn enough of a reputation to run for a seat in the Illinois state assembly, which marked the beginning of his political career. Lincoln’s lack of wealth, access to education, parental support and connections stand in stark contrast to the circumstances of Theodore Roosevelt. He was born with a trust fund bequeathed to him by his grandfather, a banker, merchant and real estate mogul who was one of the five richest individuals in New York. His father was a well-respected philanthropist who provided him with a rigorous formal education and access to an extensive family library. If there was a book he didn’t already have, his father would help him procure it. When Theodore Roosevelt reached early adulthood, he did not need to convince local citizens of his merit to enter politics. Thanks to the power already attached to his family’s name, he was recruited to run for the state assembly of New York by the local Republican Party. If two people from such disparate circumstances could both become transformative presidents, the keys to becoming a great leader must lie somewhere else than in one’s background. Another place to look for the key to becoming a great leader might be shared personal characteristics. But the influential presidents under consideration suggest we look elsewhere. Their personal characteristics were as different as their backgrounds. Franklin Roosevelt and Lincoln, for example, had drastically different temperaments. Growing up with loving parents who provided him with a warm, stable, peaceful and nurturing home environment, Roosevelt was blessed with a sunny, optimistic outlook on life. Lincoln, in contrast, was prone to melancholy, which began to appear at an early age, when his lofty ambitions and lowly circumstances seemed totally at odds with each other. Between Lincoln and the other Roosevelt, Theodore, we can also see a diametric opposition between their physical characteristics. Lincoln was remarkably tall, strong, athletic and healthy – qualities that brought him respect from his male companions starting from a young age. He was never sick, according to his relatives, and as a young man, he was able to carry heavy loads that would be difficult for three ordinary men to lift, according to a friend. Theodore Roosevelt, in contrast, was plagued by frequent bouts of illness, fragility and asthma that necessitated days of bed rest. With their mental characteristics, Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt provide another set of contrasting examples. As a child, Lincoln was praised for his exceptional feats of memory – but they did not come to him naturally. He had to put considerable effort into memorizing things – copying out whole passages from books multiple times, for instance. Roosevelt, by contrast, was blessed with a photographic memory; he could read a passage only once and remember it for the rest of his life. Even the presidents’ attitudes toward work and free time were different. Given their achievements, you might expect them all to have been workaholics, but this was true only of Johnson. He rarely saw movies or plays, almost never read anything besides the news and couldn’t even attend a baseball game or a social event without turning it into an opportunity to talk about politics. In contrast, the other three presidents each had their diversions: poetry and drama for Lincoln, birds and novels for Theodore Roosevelt and sailing and poker for Franklin Roosevelt. In popular imagination, great leaders are sometimes portrayed as larger-than-life figures with almost superhuman strength. However, when we examine the transformational presidents, we see that this is an oversimplification. The presidents’ were undeniably gifted, but they were also undeniably human, with strengths that were remarkable but not miraculous, and with weaknesses as well. Let’s start with their strengths. Like their circumstances and personal characteristics, these too were varied. Yet again, Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt provide contrasting examples. One of Lincoln’s great strengths was his ability to learn through patient observation. When he first joined his state assembly, he quietly waited on the sidelines so he could watch and learn how it worked from a distance before involving himself in the fray. Roosevelt, on the other hand, had a much more gung-ho approach: he dove right into action and aggressively interrogated his fellow legislators about how their assembly worked – often violating procedural rules and irritating his colleagues in the process. His doing so was expressive of one of his great strengths and a potential weakness: his uncontainable energy and lack of inhibition. Like Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin Roosevelt also had a double-edged strength that could turn into a weakness. He had a willingness to bend, bypass or even break the rules when convinced that the ends justified the means. For instance, as Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Franklin Roosevelt figured out a clever way of getting around regulations against selling weapons to merchant ships. Namely, offer them as loans instead of sales. On another occasion, he felt so certain of the need for new guns, supplies and equipment worth millions of dollars that he put in an order for them before Congress had approved the funds. A particularly vivid illustration of a strength turning into a weakness comes from Johnson, who was masterful at using cunning procedural tactics in Congress to accomplish his agenda. For example, to rescue his civil rights bill from legislative limbo in the House of Representatives, he craftily made use of an arcane procedure known as a discharge petition, in which a bill stuck in committee was brought to the floor for a vote. However, he also used such tactics to ramp up the Vietnam War without full public awareness – by manipulating the federal budget to conceal its escalating defense costs, for instance. Despite their differences, the transformative presidents all had one thing in common: ambition. The crucial role that ambition plays in the path to leadership can be clarified by contrasting Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt’s very different upbringings. If you described Lincoln’s impoverished, formally uneducated background on paper, he wouldn’t exactly sound like he had the makings of becoming a successful politician, let alone arguably the greatest president in US history. Thanks to his ambition, however, he was able to overcome the challenges of his upbringing and develop his talents – particularly in regard to education. We can see this even at the beginning of his educational journey. Upon learning how to print the letters of the alphabet, he started practicing his writing on every surface he could find – even charcoal, dust, sand and snow. Fast-forward to his young adulthood, and we see the same tenacity in his independent study of the law. He would stay up late into the night after his long working day to read legal cases. He would have to borrow the law book one at a time after hiking 40 miles back and forth to get each one. Now, cut to Theodore Roosevelt. Given his privileged upbringing, it might seem like Roosevelt had the world served to him on a silver platter and therefore didn’t need ambition. But, by the same token, it would have been all too easy for him to have rested on his laurels and simply coasted into a life of comfort, especially given his frailty. However, instead of dampening his ambition, his frailty actually helped to kindle it. Prevented from joining the physically demanding games of his siblings, Roosevelt became a voracious reader of books, which deepened his knowledge, sparked his imagination and left him with a thirst for adventure – a thirst that would later lead him to explore the backwoods of Maine and lead a regiment in the Spanish-American War. But as long as his body remained frail, that thirst for adventure would remain unquenched. Recognizing this, he devoted himself to a strenuous exercise regime from the age of ten through college, providing himself with first-hand experience in overcoming hardship and gaining the ability to pursue many exploits later in life. One of the crucial elements in the transformational presidents’ ascendence to leadership was their abilities to combine their strengths and ambitions with a sense of greater national purpose. Lyndon Johnson clearly shows the importance of the latter, as his successes and failures largely hinged on the presence or absence of such a purpose. One of Johnson’s strengths was his mastery of clever procedural tactics. This strength could lead him to very positive accomplishments, as in his promotion of Civil Rights. However, it could also lead him to very negative results, as in his escalation of the Vietnam War. Let’s start with one of his main successes. His promotion of Civil Rights was part of his larger agenda, known as the Great Society. This referred to a set of programs aimed at eliminating not just racial injustice but also poverty. Guided by this lofty goal, he achieved an enormous amount, including the creation of a national health insurance program for the elderly, called Medicare, and the passage of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibited racially discriminatory voting laws. Now let’s turn to one of his main failures. In his escalation of the Vietnam War, he had no higher purpose guiding him. His aim was simply to avoid losing face, both personally and nationally. He thought that if North Vietnam defeated US-backed South Vietnam, it would be a humiliating blow to both his presidential legacy and America’s stature in the world. Without the guidance of a higher purpose, he went stumbling from one short-term decision to another – each one simply geared towards trying to contain the problem that the war represented. For example, in response to North Vietnamese raids on US barracks, he ordered airstrikes in February of 1965. The airbases from which the strikes were launched needed protection, so he sent in troops to guard them. Those troops then needed protection themselves, so he sent in even more troops. By April, there were more than 50,000 US troops in South Vietnam. Eventually, that number would exceed 500,000. Johnson’s mixed legacy is a reflection of his mixed sense of higher purpose. Guided by such a purpose, he accomplished the promotion of Civil Rights and the Great Society. Lacking such a purpose, he also laid the groundwork for one of the greatest tragedies of both the ‘60s and the ‘70s: the Vietnam War – one of the most disastrous conflicts in US history. When he was 25 years old, Franklin Roosevelt envisaged a linear, step-by-step path that would take him straight to the White House – a path that combined his political ambitions with his lifelong interest in naval history. Step one, New York state legislator; step two, assistant secretary of the Navy; step three, governor of New York; step four, president of the United States. Having achieved the first two steps by age 31, he seemed well on his way to the Oval Office. But then, the most devastating event of his life happened. At the age of 39, he developed polio, leaving him unable to walk or stand on his own. As Franklin’s story illustrates, the only certainty on the path to leadership is uncertainty. Each of the other three transformative presidents provide ample illustrations of this truth as well. Lincoln lost his first run for office in the Illinois state assembly. After he won his second run, he staked his reputation on spearheading a push for a massive overhaul of the state’s infrastructure. Facing the headwinds of a multi-year recession, the push collapsed, leaving incomplete bridges, canals and railroads in its wake. Lincoln was so devastated by the push’s failure that his friends confiscated his razors, fearing he might commit suicide. He became increasingly depressed, to the point where he became bedridden for days on end, neither eating nor sleeping, which left him emaciated and delirious. His doctors feared he was on the verge of lunacy. Theodore Roosevelt and Johnson suffered periods of severe depression as well. For Roosevelt, it was triggered by a devastating personal loss: both his wife and his mother unexpectedly died on the same day when he was 25 years old. For Johnson, it was precipitated by a heart attack that occurred as he was gathering steam for a presidential run after becoming the youngest ever majority leader of the US senate. With the media all but running obituaries for his political ambitions just when they seemed to be reaching their peak, he retreated to bed, laying still as a corpse in a state of despondency. Each of the four eventual presidents found himself flat on his back, both figuratively and literally. The most pivotal moments in their paths to the White House hinged on how they got back on their feet. For each of the presidents, one of the most crucial steps in the path to leadership hinged on how they responded to their setbacks. For all four men, this meant retreating from politics for a while – not just to recover but also to reflect and rebuild themselves. As a result, these setbacks allowed them to forge the stronger selves that would eventually propel them to greatness. Lincoln returned to a career as a lawyer, during which time he assiduously studied the law and developed his public speaking skills in front of juries – skills that would enable him to become one of the greatest orators in American history. Theodore Roosevelt built a ranch in the Badlands of South Dakota and lived the life of a rugged Westerner for a couple of years – transforming his frail, boyish body into that of a muscular man and replacing his timidity with unshakable courage in the process. Johnson withdrew to his ranch in Texas Hill Country, where he devoted six months to improving his diet, exercising, spending more time with his family, learning to treat his staff in a less demanding manner, reconnecting to his political values and reevaluating his political goals. Johnson emerged from his convalescence with a renewed sense of purpose, which led him to champion a series of boldy progressive policy proposals immediately upon his return to the Senate. These proposals included expanding Social Security and eliminating poll taxes, which were a major impediment to black citizens’ abilities to vote. Franklin Roosevelt devoted seven years to regaining his physical strength. However, his disease imposed limits on the extent to which he could recover on his own. To circumvent these limits, he gathered a small team of confidants who could act as surrogates for him – attending public events, giving speeches on his behalf and keeping his reputation alive in political circles. This small team was a harbinger of the larger teams he would assemble later when he became governor of New York and president of the United States. These teams would prove crucial to his success. Franklin Roosevelt’s restricted mobility serves as a stark reminder of the reason why every leader needs a team for support: even with Lincoln-esque mobility, no one can be everywhere or do everything at once. Everyone needs help to establish relationships and obtain information. Everyone needs strong team members to augment his or her limited powers. This was certainly true of the transformative presidents, and it was especially true of Lincoln, who knew he needed a supportive team right from the start of his presidency. Even before his inauguration, the southern states were already seceding and forming the Confederacy, posing the gravest national crisis in the history of the United States. To contend with this crisis, Lincoln assembled a diverse cabinet that wove together every disparate faction of his Republican Party, ranging from conservatives to radicals, and including all three of his main former rivals: Edward Bates, Salmon Chase and William Seward. With the nation in dire straits, he felt he needed to gather its most politically talented citizens to help him steer its course, regardless of their differences. However, he derived strength from his team not just in spite of but because of its differences, which enabled him to view his decisions from multiple angles, consider alternative courses of actions and weigh his choices until the optimal ones emerged. For example, his cabinet gave him a range of opinions on the Emancipation Proclamation, which declared the freedom of slaves living in the Confederacy. \"Move forward with it right away,\" said some. \"Hold back to avoid alienating the border states, England and France,\" said others. “Be careful about the optics of issuing it now,” warned his Secretary of State, William Seward, who was concerned it would seem like an act of desperation in the midst of the North’s recent losses to the South. Ultimately, Lincoln piloted a cautious middle course. He waited for a significant victory against the South before issuing the Proclamation. That victory came with the Battle of Antietam, which led to the retreat of Robert E. Lee’s army from Maryland and Pennsylvania. Reflecting on the timing of the Proclamation later in life, Lincoln considered his decision to wait absolutely crucial to its success. He felt certain that if it had been issued even just six months earlier, it would have failed to find public support. As we have seen, each of the transformative presidents faced a significant personal crisis from which they ultimately grew as leaders. Upon reaching the White House, each of them also faced a grave national crisis: for Lincoln, the Civil War; for Theodore Roosevelt, the Coal Strike of 1902; for Franklin Roosevelt, the Great Depression; and for Johnson, the assassination of President Kennedy. Of the four presidents, Franklin Roosevelt provides the clearest illustration of the point at hand. That's in part because there were many parallels between the economic calamity behind the national crisis he faced and the physical affliction behind the personal crisis he weathered. Like his body struck by polio, the economy was paralyzed by the Depression. Industry was grinding to a halt, and a quarter of workers were unemployed. Money stopped circulating; the banks started shutting down. To overcome polio, Franklin had experimented with one recovery method after another – testing out dozens of newfangled contraptions, such as an electric belt and an oversized tricycle. Ultimately, he built his own rehabilitation center in Warm Springs, Georgia. Faced with the Great Depression, he knew that a similar spirit of experimentation and willingness to pursue bold programs was needed. In both cases, he didn't know a secret solution to the problem, but he knew the only way to find one was to try things out and see what stuck. From this spirit and willingness sprung a multitude of innovative governmental agencies designed to get people back to work, pump life back into the economy and raise the nation's spirits – programs such as the Civil Works Administration, the Works Progress Administration, the Public Works Administration and the Civilian Conservation Corps, among 16 others. The latter was one of his first initiatives, and it set an early precedent for the boldness of his vision. Setting up 1,500 camps in America's neglected national forests, the Corps provided jobs to a quarter of a million young men at one point, who worked on clearing dead trees and shrubs, planting new trees, clearing paths and building firewalls. His Secretary of Labor, Frances Perkins, thought the plan was a crazy pipe dream, but Roosevelt persisted, knowing all too well that desperate times called for dramatic measures. The key message in these blinks: Great leaders are not simply made by their circumstances or the personal characteristics with which they were born, nor are they lifted into their positions and accomplishments by some sort of superhuman ability to lead. They form themselves by taking their fallible strengths, fusing them with ambition and a sense of greater purpose, augmenting them with the strengths of their team members and refining them as they weather their own personal crises. By doing so, they are then able to rise to the occasion when confronted by larger crises on the world stage.  Actionable advice: Draw leadership lessons from your own personal crises. Like the transformational presidents, everyone has had their own “dark nights of the soul,” which they’ve overcome in one way or another. Try asking yourself, how did you overcome yours – and how can you apply what you did then to the professional crises you may face now or in the future? Got feedback?

That was then. Pick up a random business magazine today, and you’ll learn that being a successful leader means being authentic, caring and empathic. But is this really a good leadership style? Do you really reach the top by being a modest, authentic and generally nice person all the time? These blinks take an alternative look at leadership and challenge the common assumptions of today’s leadership literature. In these blinks, you’ll learn what a “GE jerk” is; why successful leaders aren’t afraid to lie; and why the number of administrators is on the rise in many organizations.  Business gurus are a lot like preachers. But instead of delivering comforting myths about a divine, benevolent being, they spread myths about heroic business leaders and the secrets of their ways. These heroic stories have manufactured appealing images, reputations and legacies, but they fall far short of giving a realistic portrait. Take the story of former General Electric CEO Jack Welch. The stories have painted him as a man who valued every employee, always instilled confidence in his subordinates and promoted long-term strategies and vision for GE. What the stories tend to leave out is the term “GE jerks,” which former employees used to describe the kind of worker that existed under Welch’s leadership. Welch had what was referred to as a “rank and yank” policy: every year the bottom 10 percent of GE’s managers would be fired regardless of their overall career performance. This made GE managers ruthless and unpleasant as they desperately chased results. Other details that business gurus also tend to leave out include the pollution lawsuits filed against GE, the corporation’s price-fixing schemes and the cases of fraud that went on during his reign. When we create flawless biographies of figures like Jack Welch, it’s really a detriment since people will invariably come to the conclusion that they couldn’t possibly live up to their legacy. As a result, people don’t even bother trying. When author Michael Dyson wrote a biography of Martin Luther King, Jr., he didn’t shy away from mentioning his adultery because he felt it was important not to mythologize our leaders. King’s imperfections are what make King more relatable and human, and therefore more inspirational as a historical figure. To realize that our heroes also have flaws is vital to our ability to feel as though we’re able to follow in their footsteps and bring about social change in our community. We need to understand that great things can indeed be achieved by imperfect people. On the other hand, presenting inspirational figures as flawless keeps real change from ever occurring – the problems persist and the gurus stay in business.  No one will accuse Donald Trump of false modesty. His businesses are all plastered with his name: Trump Casino, Trump Steaks, Trump Tower and so on. While this makes him the butt of many jokes, it doesn’t change the fact that he’s the 417th richest man in the world, worth an estimated $4 billion. So it’s safe to say Trump might know a thing or two about business leadership, especially when it comes to self-promotion. Effective self-promotion is a way to draw attention to your positive qualities and speak highly of yourself, which is a skill that can get you hired and move you up the corporate ladder. Research has shown that interviewers rate job applicants higher and recommend candidates who show an ability for self-promotion. This is because self-promotion is just another form of self-confidence, which is a quality that rubs off on other people and makes them feel better about themselves. A 2012 study by the Berkeley Business School shows that both confident and overconfident people received more respect and achieved higher social status and influence within their groups. This was the case even when the members of these groups were aware that the person’s overconfidence was unjustified. Similar benefits have been shown to hold true for leaders with narcissistic tendencies, such as self-importance, arrogance and the belief that they should receive special or unique treatment. A study of CEOs during the 2007 financial crisis discovered that while companies led by narcissistic CEOs suffered more at the start of the crisis, their personality led to increased chances of survival. In part due to their outsized self-confidence, narcissists have a stronger desire for action and risk-taking. This helped narcissistic CEOs steer their companies to recover from the crisis with greater success. These characteristics have also been shown to benefit the biggest leaders: US presidents. After reviewing the performance of 41 former presidents, those with fearless dominance, which is a mixture of narcissism, glibness and guiltlessness, received the best evaluations of presidential leadership. This included their overall persuasiveness and ability to manage a crisis. When athletes are exhausted, with cramping muscles and sore bones, they have to convince themselves to “play through the pain.” Leaders are often expected to do a similar thing and block out their emotions in order to make the best business decisions. This is another fact that gets glossed over in books about leadership, which often suggest the best leaders are always the most authentic ones. But in reality, successful leaders are generally putting on a show and displaying different versions of themselves. Helen Rubin has published a number of biographies of legendary leaders and even gotten to know some of them. She believes that leaders gain their most successful qualities by acting. They rehearse the desired quality until it eventually sinks in and becomes natural; it would be hard to call such a quality “authentic.” This was the case for Andy Grove, former CEO of Intel, who would toughen up his shy managers by putting them through a workshop called “wolf school.” Here, managers got comfortable with behavior like leaning in and shouting in someone’s face. All of this was designed to give managers a strong sense of confidence and the ability to convince one of Intel’s hard-nosed directors of their brilliant ideas. Even if they didn’t feel particularly confident, they were taught to act as if they were. The message was: fake it until you believe it. This is the same sort of principle that was the subject of a 1979 sociological study. It looked at a number of jobs where employees had to display positive emotions, regardless of how they actually felt. The results showed that this can be psychologically demanding and stressful – but that it’s also good for business. If you’re the CEO of a company that employs thousands of people, you’ll probably be expected to come off as a smart and strong individual when you interact with employees. And the same would be true for an entrepreneur who’s hoping to become that robust CEO, since the goal is to attract talented employees, customers and investors who see you as a confident and trustworthy leader. As children, we’re told that lying is bad, a sinful act. Many American kids are told to emulate the young George Washington, who was caught cutting down a cherry tree when he was six years old and made a famous confession: “I can’t tell a lie. I did it with my hatchet.” Yet not only is this story most likely a fictional one; lying has also proven to be highly useful for successful business leaders, especially for those trying to gain and hold onto power. In 2014, a study showed that people in positions of power lie more often than others and with greater ease. Researchers concluded that having power made lying less stressful since powerful people are less likely to be subjected to the consequences of dishonesty than those without power. When describing Steve Jobs, an Apple employee used the phrase “reality distortion field” to describe Jobs’s habit of inventing his own version of reality about Apple, its devices and success. When Jobs died, it was revealed that the FBI had files on him with quotes from several people who’d questioned his honesty. They felt that Jobs had a tendency to twist the truth and distort reality in an effort to reach his goals. Another reason leaders use lying to their advantage is to smooth over difficult situations where conflicting interests might otherwise stand in the way. Another 2014 study looked at 200 talent-management companies, and they found that 73 percent of them had decided that the best policy was to mislead their employees into thinking they had a chance of being promoted. Management found this to be a good way of establishing much friendlier relationships with employees. Since people tend to see themselves as above average, this method takes advantage of a person’s natural predisposition for wishful thinking. Mark Twain was probably onto something when he wrote: “Truth is such a precious commodity, it should be used sparingly.” One of the many perks of being wealthy and powerful would appear to be the ability to break your commitments if you no longer feel like doing something. If you’ve ever had to deal with keeping track of a powerful person’s schedule, you’ll be familiar with how quickly things can change. Nevertheless, books on leadership will often promote the idea that establishing trust is an essential part of success. Yet the truth is, many businesses perform fantastically even when people have a very low opinion of the leader’s trustworthiness. In 2011, a survey of American workers found that only 14 percent considered their business leaders to be ethical and honest. Meanwhile, only 10 percent trusted their managers to make the right decisions in difficult times, and 7 percent believed senior management was telling the truth about their actions.  is a worldwide survey that gauges the trust people have in CEOs, and in 2014 that trust stood at less than 50 percent. When leaders decide to change their mind and their plans, it’s not necessarily a sign of evildoing. As any CEO will tell you, circumstances and conditions can change quickly and a CEO has to react accordingly. It’s common for organizations to break alliances with one company and start doing deals with its competitors. In 2005, Jason Calacanis sold his company, Weblogs, to its rival AOL – and for good reason. In his experience, it’s unwise to enter into an alliance work with a big corporation like LinkedIn or Facebook when to developing your ideas. In all likelihood, they’ll steal your innovative idea and create their own version of a similar product, without so much as a thank you. A recent management study took a closer look at contract breaching and found that actions by people aren’t regarded in the same light as actions by companies. When an individual breaks the terms of a contract, it’s generally seen as reprehensible, but when an organization does it, it’s seen as an unavoidable fact of doing business – no big deal. There are more than a few differences between military leadership and business leadership. In the military, officers care so much about their personnel that they often won’t eat until everyone else has had their fill. In business, only a fool believes that their boss has any concern about how hungry they might be. Business books love to suggest that the best leaders really care about their employees, but when it comes down to it, leaders use their power primarily for their own benefit – not their employee’s. In 1975, a sociological study was done to determine why the number of school administrators increases disproportionately to other positions. And it was found that, once administrators gain a certain amount of power, they use it to protect their job when times get tough. So, in prosperous times, more administrative jobs become available, and in tough times, job losses will affect the more vulnerable bottom tier positions, with the administrators using their power to stay safe. As a result, the administrator jobs stack up while the others even out. Expecting a leader to look after employees is naïve. It’s wiser to expect leaders to use their employees as scapegoats for their mistakes in order to stay confident and self-assured. The leaders of General Motors have spent years blaming their financial woes on the money they need to spend to keep union workers from striking. This would include health insurance, retirement and other agreed-upon benefits. But the real reason for GM’s problem was that consumers prefer their competition’s cars – especially Toyota, which sold about 30 percent more than GM in 2004. But to admit this would require executives to accept the blame, which is something they’ll work diligently to avoid. There are different ways businesses will try to protect their prosperity and power, many of which may adversely affect their employees. A round of layoffs is probably the most distressing option, but others include relocating to cheaper offices and cutting back on supplies. There’s a message here that every employee can learn from: protect your own neck! There’s no reason to think you have to work hard and stay loyal to a company that doesn’t care for you. In fact, it’s pretty foolish to do so. There was a recent study that checked in with students from a management school shortly after graduation, and then checked in again two years later. The students were asked how well they felt their jobs had lived up to the reciprocal expectations they had when first hired. Around 55 percent felt that the specific promises their job had made when they were recruited had been violated. Reciprocity is a social and moral obligation between two parties to honor and repay one party’s efforts. But this is a concept that means very little in the workplace. A 2015 study highlighted the difference between workplace and personal reciprocity. When people were asked to imagine being picked up from an airport, either by a coworker or by a personal friend, they felt far more obligated to repay the friend than the colleague. Psychologists have a theory as to why this is, and it comes down to the payment one receives for effort. And this works both ways: leaders don’t assume employees are performing a favor by being loyal and working hard. They believe these efforts are being repaid with their paycheck, and no further reciprocity is required. It’s also worth noting that business transactions are generally forward thinking and not concerned with the past. So if someone is doing a favor, it’s because they hope to get special consideration in the future. If you watch sports, especially soccer or basketball, you’re probably familiar with playacting, which is when one player dramatically falls after receiving the slightest touch from the opposing player. This is a strategic move that the best players will perfect, since it costs them nothing and, if it works, it may earn them a free kick or a couple of free throws. The best leaders are also familiar with the benefits of playacting. So if you want to know what’s really going on, it’s best to keep an eye on their performance and what they’re doing, rather than what they’re saying. IDEO is one of the best product-design firms and they’ve done a good job of holding onto their talented employees, in large part because they promote a culture of design thinking. In order to come up with better designs, employees are encouraged to watch how others solve problems instead of just listening to them talk. This same principle has found its way to leadership training: aspiring managers and executives now pay attention to behavior traits as well as everything else. Thus, socializing and dealing with people outside of the office are now recognized as two of the most important skills for a successful leader. So while the leadership industry might say they adhere to religious and moral virtues, if you watch what they’re really doing, you may see the immoral truth. The classic book The Prince, by Machiavelli, remains a relevant depiction of someone using immoral actions in the name of the greater good and the protection of a virtuous society. This happens a lot in politics and leadership, where security and prosperity are routinely achieved through dubious means – so much so that the job is often about finding the least dubious path to success. By most accounts, Steve Jobs was a bully, and being threatened by him was so commonplace it had its own name: “You’ve been Steved.” But who knows whether, without plenty of Steving, Apple would have become the paragon of success it is today. The key message in this book: The myths we’ve created about our most celebrated leaders are costing people their jobs and creating unhappy work environments. The inspiring recommendations in popular leadership literature are by and large bogus, because they don’t take into account the reality behind social-science research, human behavior and what really goes on in the day-to-day functions of a CEO. It may not be pretty, but being a successful leader involves lying, breaking promises, rewriting contracts and misleading your employees so they’ll stay motivated.  Actionable advice: Use distrust to your advantage. You can predict a colleague’s future behavior by considering how they have behaved in the past. Colleagues who have previously reneged on commitments or broken promises are bound to act this way again. So be distrustful of them if the data shows that their previous behavior reveals a certain trend. This can be more accurate than what they tell you or how they try to present themselves. So before you place your trust and future well-being in the hands of someone else, do your homework and see what they’ve been up to in the past. Got feedback?

Even a great visionary like Steve Jobs suffered from blind spots, despite his reputation for success. Although effective, Jobs’ leadership style angered many of his colleagues. For example, he would refuse to see any information that didn’t support his views, and would simply ignore those who disagreed with him. Worse still, Jobs had zero awareness that people harbored negative feelings about him. His belief in his own greatness shrouded his perception. This blind spot eventually had massive consequences when he got into a quarrel with Apple CEO John Sculley. Jobs demanded that the board remove his rival, yet faced with the ultimatum of keeping either Jobs or Sculley, the board warned that it would be the divisive Jobs who would be packing his bags. Leadership blind spots can have catastrophic consequences, and the more power a leader has within a company, the greater the consequences of her blind spot. Take Ron Johnson, for example, who did wonders as a retail leader at Target and Apple before being snatched up by JCPenney as their new CEO. JCPenney hoped he would transform the company, and gave him plenty of power to do so. This was a huge mistake. In his arrogance, he made sweeping changes, including deep price cuts. His confidence hid his lack of knowledge about the company’s values and image, and ultimately resulted in a loss of $1 billion in the first year as JCPenney lost its traditional customers. Clearly, blind spots can be severely damaging for your company and career. In the following blinks, we’ll examine how you can identify your own personal blind spots. The first step in correcting your blind spots is figuring out what and where they are. Luckily, there is one thing in particular that throws them into sharp relief: mistakes. Mistakes show us the areas in which we lack knowledge, competence and understanding, and thus represent areas which might be our blind spots. It is therefore crucial that you analyze your mistakes, especially the ones you keep making, to uncover the blind spots that caused them in the first place. The author, for example, has had a long and successful career as a consultant, yet his career is nonetheless riddled with mistakes. One such misjudgment was concentrating only on improving the results for his clients, i.e., executives, without considering how his services would affect the teams they led. One team in particular was severely affected by his suggestions and later complained about their new workload, thus highlighting his error. After learning about this mistake, he realized he had a blind spot: he wasn’t considering the bigger picture when giving advice to business leaders. However, once he was aware of his blind spot, he was able to change his strategy and avoid problems in the future. But your blind spots aren’t overcome by the simple awareness that they exist. Often leaders will ignore blind spots, thinking they’re trivial. Sometimes, fixing a blind spot requires a considerable amount of effort and change, and it’s so much easier to stick with the status quo, which requires less effort. But this attitude will inevitably lead to huge problems. Consider Xerox’s R&D group PARC, for example, which played an important role at the start of the computer industry. However, they tended to concentrate on short-term profits, failed to keep up with industry innovations, and never lived up to their early promise. The company’s senior management knew they were falling behind, but didn’t try hard enough to change course, and were consequently overtaken by competitors. Most of us don’t like feedback, especially if it’s critical. It’s hard not to take it personally when someone trashes our ideas or strategies. Yet much as we loathe it, there is nothing more important to working well and avoiding blind spots than getting regular feedback from others. The people close to you often see the weakness and threats to your career or business that you yourself, busy living your career and running your business, can’t see. This concept was codified in 1955 by two American psychologists, Joseph Luft and Harrington Ingham, who developed the Johari Window, a model which shows the differences between how others see you and how you see yourself.  According to the model, the fact that people have different vantage points from which to examine their environment makes it possible for employees to see weaknesses in their leaders that the leaders themselves are unable to recognize. History is full of examples of employees helping their bosses find their weak spots. Meg Whitman, who is now CEO of Hewlett-Packard, is a case study. Earlier in her career, she gave her boss feedback about his leadership style, telling him that he pushed his opinion on the team and that the team therefore had no confidence in or ownership of their work. He’d had no idea! He was able to use this feedback to change his management style, become a better listener and a more understanding leader. But you don’t want just any feedback. You want honest feedback. That means you have to actually ask for it. People don’t often volunteer criticism of their boss to their boss. So leaders have a responsibility to ask for it. That way, even the most timid of employees will feel comfortable telling you what they think. Another way is to consult a third party, such as an external consultant or an HR manager. Because the feedback is anonymous, it is therefore unbiased. Not all blind spots are equal: some might destroy you while others will merely set you back. Blind spots aren’t equally important in determining leaders’ success. They exist in various areas of your responsibility, and depending on your role, some of these areas will be more important than others. Having a blind spot in your market knowledge could be catastrophic if you’re a marketing manager, but it could be virtually meaningless if you’re the head of catering. In determining whether a particular blind spot is actually worth addressing, it’s helpful to reflect on the following analogy from Bill Gore, the founder of W. L. Gore & Associates, Inc. Imagine you’re engaged in a naval battle and your ship is being shelled. Suddenly, a shot strikes your bow. What do you do? Well, if the shot has struck above the waterline, then there’s little chance of sinking and thus little to be concerned about. If it struck below the waterline, then you’re in deep trouble. Leaders should encourage their teams to analyze where their possible blind spots lie and do the same for themselves. If they’re in a place that could sink the company, then it’s time for swift action. However, it is also important to recognize that not all blind spots are destructive. In the right situation, blind spots can even be helpful for those who are prone to indecision and fear. Blind spots can give leaders a boost of confidence: without seeing the dangers ahead, they can plow forward with their idea without fear of failure. Take Sara Blakely, who started with only $5,000 and became the youngest self-made female billionaire in history. Her blind spots – not thinking about risks and being overly tenacious – helped her overcome her inexperience and become wildly successful. The popular perception of the political class is one of a clueless elite, oblivious to the concerns of the rest of us. This is true, but not only for politicians. Any leader, in fact, will lose touch with their team as they begin their climb up the slippery pole. As leaders climb higher up the ranks, their knowledge about what happens below them dries up. Toward the top, managers have to think more about things that affect the entire company, like overall business strategy, customer organization, public relations, and so on, and less about what actually goes on in the company. Leaders, no matter what level they find themselves at, can avoid this by spending time engrossing themselves in the business of the workers “below” them. It is vital that they are proactive, so that they never completely lose perspective. This is the idea behind the popular TV show Undercover Boss, in which company leaders work the “lower” jobs in their own company in order to correct their perception of the comings and goings of everyone who isn’t in the upper echelon. As the show demonstrates, it’s not enough for leaders to get this information second hand. They must witness with their own eyes how things really work. Often, leaders get their information from concise, filtered reports. Yet the staff who edit these reports can’t know exactly what is important and what isn’t. What’s more, they’re more likely to modify or neglect information that could be damaging to their team. It is for these reasons that Andrew Gould, former CEO of Schlumberger, established a successful new rule in his company: whenever he needed information, he never asked his leadership team, but instead asked the people who were directly responsible. This way, he ensured that he got the information he needed. One of our biggest weaknesses is our tendency to see only the things which back up our own point of view, and to ignore everything that contradicts it. This willful blindness causes serious problems for leaders. It is absolutely critical that you consider all relevant data, and not just the information that backs up your viewpoint. You want to strive for objectivity, not bias. This means going beyond your comfort zone in terms of where and how you collect data. Consider, for instance, that most companies measure their performance by their budget. However, this indicator is exceedingly narrow, and doesn’t give you any information about the competition. Even if a company is raking in huge profits, it’s entirely possible that its competitors have an even greater market share and even higher gains. Examining budget performance alone could give you a false impression of the company’s risks and opportunities. The solution would be to expand your sources of information in order to expand your perspective. Good leaders have such a familiarity with diverse data that they’ve become experts at identifying the subtle warning signs that show that blind spots are developing. They know how to read between the lines, and understand gaps in the data, thus allowing them to act before problems arise. When one of the author’s clients made a proposal in a team meeting, one of his peers was unusually quiet. The leader became aware of her silence, and asked her about it. As it turns out, she had reasonable concerns about the proposal, but didn’t dare express them out of uncertainty about how her criticism would be received. Had the leader not noticed these subtle cues, then his peer’s concerns might never have been raised! A strong team can produce better work in greater amounts than one person alone. It’s therefore in every leader’s interest to select his team members carefully, and create the kinds of working conditions that maximize performance. Crucially, having the right team can help leaders to overcome their blind spots in the long term. Remember: the better you know someone, the better they will be at seeing your blind spots. For this reason, leaders should carefully select a team of trusted advisers, who regularly give specific and actionable feedback, and aren’t afraid to be constructively critical. After leaving Apple under a cloud in 1985, Steve Jobs worked for years with the same leadership team at Pixar. It included people like Ed Catmull and John Lasseter who challenged Jobs whenever a weakness in his leadership style emerged, helping him to make the best decisions possible. Jobs later attributed Pixar’s huge success to the carefully considered composition of the team. Furthermore, a good leader encourages debates to productively explore differences and maximize his strengths. By trying to avoid conflict, team members guarantee that they won’t be able to critically examine business challenges. Thus it’s important to have a diverse team and a culture of respect and constructive criticism, where important issues are discussed in detail. The one-time head of Xerox’s R&D group, Bob Taylor, established a culture of debate in his team. All activities within the group were presented in team meetings and discussed afterward. Taylor wanted his team members to openly criticize one another’s ideas, but always be respectful. Strengthened by this culture, the group was able to identify nearly all Xerox’s technical weaknesses, and the company developed many outstanding innovations, such as the first pull-down menus, the mouse as a navigation device and laser printers. As a leader, it’s up to you to ensure that your team is diverse and willing to debate in order to help you identify and overcome blind spots. The key message in this book: For one reason or another, there will always be gaps in our knowledge and performance – blind spots – that prevent us from doing our best work. Maximizing your leadership performance means identifying and overcoming these blind spots with the help of a solid team.

Yet Leadership Is an Art stands out; here’s why. This book refuses to present leadership as a single-minded quest for short-term profits. It doesn’t frame a company leader as someone who’s main job is to manipulate employees aggressively into working as much and as hard as they can. As these blinks show, leadership should be in the business of establishing and fostering fair, caring relationships as well as meaningful collaboration among employees. You’ll learn how to motivate your employees to act as if they own the company – not you – and why you should make this a goal. In these blinks, you’ll also learn what it takes to be an elegant leader; what great benefits you earn when you listen to your employees; and why it’s a big problem if people in your company swear a lot. In the movies, the “evil boss” is a classic character. He’s intimidating and rude, barking orders at subordinates from behind a big, heavy desk. Good leadership, however, is the direct opposite of this caricature. Being a good leader is about being helpful, leading employees in a team with the ultimate goal of performing better. A leader provides employees with direction, which has three components: values, a vision and goals. A leader should communicate a company’s values. Is the firm family-friendly? Client-oriented? An employee needs to know a company’s core principles, to stay on track with work and goals. Leaders also need to be clear about what a company is working toward: the company’s vision. Which aspects of the company need to change to keep up with the times? Which traditions should be preserved? Is the company targeting a wide range of customers, or catering to a specific group? Finally, leaders have to outline a plan for achieving the company’s vision. What are the specific goals in doing so? Employees need to know what they’re aiming for. Good leadership doesn’t stop here. A good leader also makes sure employees are personally invested in a company’s mission, and actively seeks out ideas on how to improve the company. One effective strategy for engaging employees is to offer them ownership shares in the company. Giving an employee stock in the company creates a win-win situation; employees are more motivated to generate profits, and in turn, the company thrives. Strong leaders create a climate in which employees have the freedom to develop skills and ideas. The furniture company Herman Miller achieved success based on this concept. Herman Miller has been encouraging employees to share ideas for enhancing company productivity since 1950. The staff earns a cut of any gains they generate, too. From 1987 to 1988, employee suggestions helped the company save some $12 million. This strategy pays off, too: Herman Miller is regularly cited in Fortune magazine’s list of “most admired companies.” Leadership is about developing healthy, positive relationships with employees. So what’s the best way to do this? The first step is to remember that employees are humans with weaknesses and strengths, just like everyone else. Remembering your employees’ humanity is an important part of treating them with respect, a fundamental part of any healthy relationship. It also reminds you to show employees the same kindness, no matter their position in the company hierarchy. Every employee has the right to be treated well, feel included and have a covenantal relationship – a relationship in which the employee is appreciated for who he or she is. Focus on the unique strengths and skills that each employee contributes, and you'll find it much easier to manage workers and get them to collaborate well together. Don’t fall into the trap of comparing employees to some ideal you think they should live up to. Accept them for who they are. Doing so bolsters your employees’ confidence and makes them more comfortable with sharing ideas to make the company better. Employees will be more open about their skills and shortcomings as a result, so it’ll be easier for you to assign them to teams and give them certain tasks. Another key component of strong employee relationships is communication. To maintain good lines of communication, a leader needs to listen carefully to what employees have to say. What’s more, make sure employees have all the information they need about the projects they’re working on. It’s better for employees to have too much information rather than too little. Finally, be sure to word your ideas and thoughts clearly, so employees can always follow you. Remember to be compassionate and use kind words whenever you can. Change can make many people uncomfortable, but we all know that it’s an inevitable part of life. The business world is constantly in flux, and a company can keep up only if it adapts to changing circumstances. Change isn’t just about survival, however; it fosters creativity and can make work more fun, too! Everyone is forced to work in new ways when a company undergoes a big change. This event can stimulate employee creativity, providing people with new opportunities. If your company is expanding its product range, for example, this might be your chance to work on that idea you’ve been mulling over for years! In short, change isn’t something that you or your employees should fear. In fact, you should consider changing your company’s hierarchies and roles in general. In many companies, some people work only on developing product ideas while others are responsible for implementing them, that is, turning those ideas into something a customer can buy. However, it’s better when employees have the freedom to switch between roles. They’re more productive if they can work on whichever task they’re best suited for at that time. If they’re in a creative phase, for instance, they’ll contribute more if they’re allowed time to refine their ideas. But a leader can’t just switch to becoming an inventor, especially if he’s unwilling to lose his position in the company hierarchy. Such a leader has to accept that someone else might be the person to implement his ideas. When it comes to changing roles, it’s important that employees feel valued. They have to feel like they’re contributing to a project because of their specific skills. If you treat employees as if they’re interchangeable, they’ll lose interest in the work. Again, good communication helps here. So make sure employees understand that you value them, no matter what role they’re in. After all, your business wouldn’t be a success without them! Good leaders don’t just make employees happier. They have the potential to reform the profit-focused, impersonal capitalist world from the inside out. Since their conception, capitalist systems have been exclusive systems. Most employees are excluded from a company’s production process; they take orders from the top. Many are poorly paid and don’t benefit when profits increase. Thus, workers are often frustrated and unsatisfied. Good leaders know that people thrive best in inclusive environments, not exclusive ones. People are happier, healthier and more creative when they feel involved and appreciated. That’s why the best leaders favor inclusive capitalism, a system in which everyone plays a role in developing and maintaining the system itself. Inclusive capitalism is based on intimacy. Relationships aren’t just about contracts. Workplace intimacy means that you care about each of your employees and the work each person does. Capitalist systems have traditionally been based on contractual relationships, meaning that everyone simply follows the rules set out in a contract. Contractual relationships are based on material interests, not a person’s well-being. Covenantal relationships, on the other hand, are intimate pacts based on care. A waiter has a covenantal relationship with a customer when he truly wants that person to enjoy her meal, regardless of the restaurant’s bottom line. Coworkers have a covenantal relationship when they genuinely enjoy working together in a team. At its core, a covenantal relationship is about cooperation and not coercion. When you incorporate such relationships into your business, everyone wins. Employees are happier and more motivated, and customers are more satisfied, too. Sometimes you just know things are going well at work; but other times, you can’t shake the feeling that perhaps something is not quite right in the office. Let’s look at strategies for confirming your intuition in such situations. If your company goes into a slow period, plenty of warning signs should be visible. You’ll save time and money if you learn how to recognize these signs. It’s a bad sign if you find yourself spending more energy trying to control your employees, rather than giving them more freedom. Being over-controlling is counterproductive. You’ll only stress yourself out, and diminish your employees’ creativity and motivation. So don’t put the clamps on; talk to and listen to your employees instead. Work with them to figure out what the real problems are, and how those problems can be solved together. You can also use this strategy to address other warning signs, such as excessive swearing or office tension. Remember employees need to be involved in problem-solving; you can’t just give orders. Another important pointer for keeping your team on track is to monitor everyone’s performance, including your own! The author does this by sending employees lists of requests and topics in advance before they discuss them at a meeting. That allows employees to prepare questions and consider issues ahead of time, so the meeting runs efficiently. Such topics might include productivity, upcoming projects or even an employee's own goals for advancing her career or education. It’s important to know the personal goals of your employees so that you can match each person with a meaningful project. In doing so, you help make the employee’s personal goals align with the company’s overall goals! What exactly is an “elegant” leader? A CEO decked out in a bespoke suit or new shoes? No, those are just superficial things. Elegance in leadership goes deeper. Elegant leaders know how to lead smoothly. They’re not rushed or impulsive when it comes to making important decisions, such as agreeing to a new hire or developing a product. Instead, an elegant leader makes decisions carefully and thoughtfully. She observes and analyzes a situation before taking action. She listens carefully to employees and develops a clear plan that takes employee interests into account. An elegant leader even helps the company with the transition when she retires, by picking a good successor. The leader will sort through candidates and choose one with great communication skills, a person the leader trusts will stay devoted to staff and the company vision. When you pay this kind of careful attention to detail, you’ll rarely make mistakes or grapple with the messy process of setting a company back on course. Caring about details is an important part of running things efficiently, and elegantly. Great leaders also refrain from blaming employees when things go wrong. Such a leader never forgets that employees are human; the leader respects them for who they are and doesn’t treat them like cogs in a machine. Great leaders don’t abuse their power, either. All employees deserve to be treated well, regardless of their place in the hierarchy. We’re human, after all – workers and leaders alike. The power you have as a leader comes with a lot of responsibility. Being a good leader is ultimately about using that power in a kind, effective and helpful way. Elegance in leadership isn’t just about leading the company to success – it’s about leading benevolently, as well. The key message in this book: Great leadership is about being compassionate and humane. It’s certainly not about barking orders at people who have less power than you do. So respect your employees and listen to what they have to say. Engage them in the company’s progress as much as possible and assign them tasks they truly find meaningful. Leading in a humane way is better for everyone: you, the people with whom you work and the company as a whole.  Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Perhaps because of this, more and more people are starting to feel that they are superior to others and their needs are more important than those of the people around them. Leadership and Self-Deception explains that this mentality is in fact a form of self-deception, and very harmful to our private and professional lives. What’s worse, it spreads like a virus and results in nothing but ineffective work and negative feelings. The book explains how innocently we get infected with this virus of self-deception by simply ignoring our most natural instincts. Finally, you will also find out how you can stop the vicious cycle of self-deception to become a better leader, a more effective worker as well as a kinder, more helpful person. All people want to be treated with respect and dignity by others. This idea is so fundamental that it is even manifested in our constitutions, laws and philosophies. But when it comes to everyday life, many of us forget this ideal. In our daily interactions, we often feel that our needs and wishes are more important than those of other people. An example of this would be when we are sitting on a bus or plane, and instead of offering the empty seat next to us to others, we hope no one takes it, so we might enjoy more space. In effect, we value our own comfort above the need of others to find a seat. Because we judge the needs of others as less real and important than our own, it is easy for us to start to think of them as mere objects. This is because our sense of superiority prevents us from seeing others as equals, so we no longer see a reflection of ourselves in others. In short, we begin to lack empathy, so we no longer see others as “real” people anymore. This means that as we sit there on the bus or plane, we will probably see the other passengers as mere threats to us and our comfort, rather than as other human beings with their own needs. This phenomenon is known as self-deception or “being in the box.” In this context, self-deception means that we do not see ourselves and the people around us as they really are. Hence we are deceiving ourselves. You might say that when we are self-deceived, we are trapped inside a box, the limits of which distort our world view so we see other people as objects of little importance. To break free of self-deception, we must break free of the box. In today´s selfish world, it might seem harmless to inflate one’s own virtues and importance. But in fact, this act of self-deception is harmful and what’s worse, it is a neverending vicious circle where one act of self-deception leads to another. How? We deceive ourselves by exaggerating our own needs and virtues while simultaneously magnifying the flaws and faults of others. This distorted view makes us more prone to blame others in times of friction. For example, imagine you are arguing with your spouse about where to spend your vacation. If you are self-deceived, you will consider your own wishes as more important than your spouse’s. If an argument ensues, you will also see your own behavior as more reasonable and measured than your spouse’s. The result? You will blame your spouse for escalating the argument and for not respecting your wishes. Since you are self-deceived, you will probably not even be able to spot these flaws in reasoning. But this kind of distorted worldview cannot stand on its own, as it will be inevitably challenged by reality. In order to stop it collapsing, we need to construct self-justification for it. This means we actively look for and come up with excuses and reasons to bolster our worldview. For example, when you blame your spouse for not caring enough about your wishes regarding your holiday destination, you need to find a justification for this view. You may then inflate the importance of your own needs. For example, you might think to yourself: “I have worked so hard this year that I really need some rest and relaxation.” This kind of self-aggrandizement prevents you from seeing that your spouse has every right to express their opinion as well. We all want to be liked, respected and loved. Typically, one would think that the key to getting these things lies in our behavior: how we act toward others. But in fact, the way others see us depends on something that runs much deeper than our behavior: our underlying feelings. This is because we are often able to sense how people feel about us, even if they do not show it. For example, there have probably been times when someone has treated you nicely, but you’ve been able to sense that really, they were doing it just to extract some favor from you. We intuitively know if the behavior of the other person is not a true reflection of their feelings toward us. In fact, we tend not to respond to what people are doing per se, but rather to how we perceive their feelings toward us while they are doing it. For example, imagine you are having a ferocious argument with your spouse when you realize that you will soon be late for work. You quickly end the argument and give him or her a kiss. Though there is nothing hostile in the kiss itself, your spouse will surely sense your true underlying feelings, and probably respond negatively to your kiss. Just as others respond to our feelings, not our actions, it is not our actions that determine whether or not we are self-deceived. You can act very kindly toward someone, but still deep down feel that their needs are inferior to yours. This means that despite your apparent kindness, you are in fact self-deceived. If you think about it, any behavior can be manifested either from inside the box of self-deception, when it is driven by feelings of superiority, or from outside the box of self-deception, driven by feelings of equality. It is this difference in feelings that determines how you view others, not their behavior per se. We have seen how self-deception affects our perception of others. But it also negatively affects our own motivation and priorities, leading us to lose sight of what is really important. This is because when we are self-deceived, we must constantly look for self-justification to support our distorted worldview. This means we are not focused on what we want to achieve, be it at work or at home. For example, at work you often need to work together with other people to get good results. If you are self-deceived, you will try to undermine your co-workers’ ideas and achievements in order to justify your view that they are inferior to you. This means that the real goal – generating good ideas for your employer company – will not be your main concern anymore. Therefore self-deception can stand in the way of being productive and achieving results. Another way in which self-deception hurts us is that we actively seek out and even provoke faults in others so as to justify our own low view of them. For example, a mother who feels that her son stays out too late might set an unreasonably early curfew for him. In reality, she fully expects him to break it and thus justify her mistrust and the negative feelings about him. So in fact she is trying to provoke the very behavior she is upset about. Finally, our search for self-justification also has an impact on our own personality, by diminishing the very virtues we feel make us superior to others. For example, if we feel we are more knowledgeable than everyone else, we will probably not respond well to others trying to teach us something new, because of our self-justification for our inflated sense of wisdom. Therefore we actually hinder ourselves from learning new things and become less knowledgeable. So in conclusion, if we are self-deceived, our search for self-justification harms our relationship with others, as well as diminishes our effectiveness at our work. In our families and at work we seldom act autonomously. Interacting with other people is an inextricable part of life. This means that our self-deception has an impact on those around us as well, and can in fact spread like a virus. This is because when things go awry, if we are self-deceived we see others as inferior to ourselves, so we tend to naturally blame them. This of course makes them feel like they are being treated unfairly, which makes them defensive. They naturally begin to emphasize our faults, while inflating their own virtues in order to feel better about themselves. This way they too become self-deceived. When two people are in the box of self-deception, they both blame each other for mistreatment, and react by further mistreating the other person. This leads to a vicious cycle of mutual mistreatment. For example, if you are in a relationship and always blame your partner in every fight and disagreement, you will begin to focus on your partner’s faults so intently that you completely ignore your own mistakes and shortcomings. Your stubbornness and inability to see your own faults will eventually lead to your partner blaming you in disagreements, leading him or her to be blinded to their own faults as well. As you can see, self-deception is like a virulent infection that is passed along to others through contact. Due to the damage self-deception does to us and those around us, it is crucial to understand how we become infected ourselves and what the underlying causes for our infection are. In the following blinks, we will examine how and why this infection takes place. Humans are social beings, relying on one another and each other`s empathy to get through the trials and tribulations of life. If we are mentally healthy and balanced, it is easy for us to feel empathy, because we see a reflection of ourselves in others around us. Nevertheless, self-deception can easily creep into our mentality. The first step in this process is self-betrayal, which happens when we ignore our natural desire to help other people. Every human being instinctively wants to help others. For example, imagine you wake up one night because your baby is crying loudly in the other room. Probably your first, natural instinct will be to get up and calm your baby quickly before your spouse wakes up, because you care about your spouse and don’t want to disturb their sleep too. If you do not follow this natural instinct to be kind and helpful, you betray yourself. You may for example start wondering why it should be you who gets up, when you also need your sleep. Whereas before you considered your spouse’s need for sleep as valid and important as your own, you now begin to devalue it. You disregard their needs, and thereby betray your own natural instincts. This is the gateway to self-deception. We all know that nagging feeling that arises when we feel we should do something for another person. By now you know that if you don’t act on that feeling, you betray yourself. So how does this self-betrayal put you in the box of fully fledged self-deception? Well, in order to justify your self-betrayal, you need to change your world view. Coming back to the example of the baby crying at night: if you do not act on your desire to be helpful and kind to your spouse, you will feel a strong need to justify this inaction. Probably, you will start coming up with reasons and excuses for why you shouldn’t be the one to get up and why it should be your spouse. You might think for example, that it is always you who gets up, or that you have something important in the morning so you should be allowed to sleep. Searching for self-justification like this puts you on a path that leads to the box of self-deception. You are inflating your own needs and wishes above the needs of others, and this will lead you to blame them. In this example, you would probably start feeling angry at your spouse, blaming him or her for not getting up. This connection between self-betrayal and self-connection can be seen in the fact that we do not develop negative emotions toward others because of the way the act, but because of our own self-betrayal: When you first woke up to the sound of your baby crying, you had no negative feelings toward your spouse, you just wanted to get up and help. It was only after you betrayed yourself and made up excuses for your betrayal – thus becoming self-deceived – that your feelings for him or her took a turn for the worse. In this interval your spouse did not have the chance to do anything, hence your self-deception was purely about your own self-betrayal. So self-betrayal leads to self-deception, and self-deception, as we have seen, is harmful both privately and professionally. Next, you will find out how you can stop self-betrayal in order to prevent yourself from succumbing to self-deception. We know that when we betray ourselves by ignoring our wish to help others, it leads to self-deception. Therefore, if we can stop betraying ourselves, we can stop being self-deceived. First of all, it’s important to understand that we cannot get out of the box of self-deception by merely changing our behavior – for example, by trying to avoid others or finding ways to cope with our self-deception. This is because changing our behavior or avoiding tricky situations does not actually change our state of mind. Remember, self-deception is not defined by what we do, but by what the underlying emotions are, so simply changing behavior will not solve the problem. For example, if you’re in a relationship and you’re in the box of self-deception, because you don’t consider your partner’s feelings and needs as equal to yours, you might think it’s a good idea to start avoiding certain topics of conversation that have led to arguments in the past. But because your worldview is distorted, the quality of the relationship will not improve through this change in behavior. You will still feel your partner’s needs are inferior to yours, which will result in mistreatment, leading to arguments again. Instead, you must stop betraying yourself, and this happens the moment you start questioning whether you’re any better than the people around you. When you do this, you will no longer resist your instinct to help them. Without self-betrayal, you will see others as equal human beings with valid needs and desires, instead of as mere objects. To keep this up, you must simply keep honoring that first instinct you have to help and be kind to others. You need to constantly monitor your feelings and instincts, especially when dealing with different people, as it is possible to be self-deceived toward some people, but not toward others. To fully free yourself of self-deception, you need a long-term commitment. We have all experienced the liberating feeling of being outside the box of self-deception when interacting with some people. Be it in your private life or at work, the feeling of dealing with someone on a basis of mutual respect is a positive and inspiring one, and also a key to success. To be a successful leader, you must be free of self-deception. Great leaders treat people as equals and with underlying respect, thereby gaining willing and loyal followers. Even if the leadership methods are strict or demanding, those being led will not resent the leaders as they do not feel that they are devalued. Therefore as a leader, you have the responsibility to get out of the box of self-deception yourself, as well as helping others get out in turn. This is because the more people are out of the box at a workplace, the more a culture of responsibility will emerge, instead of a culture where people blame each other. Without the need to seek self-justification for their self-deception, people accept their responsibilities and focus on working more efficiently and achieving results. Also, in our private lives, refraining from self-betrayal and honoring our desire to help others makes life easier. When families and friends treat each other helpfully and as equals, they do not waste energy blaming others or justifying themselves, and are happier as a result Getting out of the box of self-deception has so many positive effects that clearly we should all strive to achieve it. By bringing this culture of equality and respect to our families and to our workplaces, we can hopefully inspire others to get out of the box as well, thereby spreading positive effects further. The key message in this book: Many of us are in the box of self-deception: we consider the needs and wishes of others as less important than our own. This has all kinds of negative effects, harming our relationships, work attitude and ability to lead others. To get out of the box we must simply start following our natural instincts to be helpful to others. Actionable advice: Try to shift your mental focus away from others and onto yourself. Instead of focusing on what others are doing wrong, try to think about what you can do right to help them. Also, don't worry about whether others are helping you enough, instead worry about whether you are helping others enough.","headers":["What’s in it for me?","We deceive ourselves by seeing other people’s needs as less important, so we treat them like objects.","Self-deception means we constantly seek justification for a worldview where others’ faults and our own virtues are inflated.","You don’t have to behave badly toward others to be self-deceived; it is enough to have bad feelings toward them.","The need for self-justification of our distorted worldview is ineffective and even destructive.","Self-deception is contagious and reinforced by the self-deception of others.","When we stop ourselves from doing something that we wanted to do for another person, we betray ourselves.","We must justify our self-betrayal, which leads us to self-deception and having negative feelings towards others.","We can stay out of the box of self-deception by always acting on our instinct to help others.","Freeing ourselves of self-betrayal and self-deception benefits our professional and private lives.","Final Summary"],"category":"Leadership","image_url":"https://images.blinkist.com/images/books/530c53d334623100081b0000/3_4/470.jpg","synopsis":"This book will show you how and why most people are in a state of self-deception where they view their needs as more important than those of people around them.

Though this way of thinking is still common, it’s incompatible with the modern workplace. Work these days is fluid; employees constantly switch jobs and roles, while businesses face challenges that are too vast and technical for any one person to overcome. That’s why we need to adopt a new, flexible mindset that recognizes the need to shift leadership as the context changes. In these blinks, you’ll find out how to do just that by empowering followers, fostering collaboration and being open to the best ideas, regardless of who proposes them. In these blinks, you’ll learn why social skills are integral to the modern workplace; how leaders depend on their followers; and how you can increase innovation by embracing flexibility. It was just a few decades ago that leadership gurus like Jack Welch rose to prominence by peddling the idea that success is built on individualism, personal drive and self-reliance. But today, such a notion is almost inconceivable; the world of business has shifted and workplaces are more team-oriented than ever before. In fact, a study conducted in 2012 found that, in the 1980s, just 20 percent of work happened in teams, compared to 80 percent in the 2010s. Thus, people entering the workforce in the twenty-first century are sometimes referred to as the “we generation.” This generation knows that working together is the best way to produce good work. This new focus on teamwork has made interpersonal skills absolutely crucial for modern employees. People who lack such skills find it practically impossible to effectively contribute to a team. After all, if you can’t communicate well, listen to others or see beyond your own ideas, how can you contribute to a group effort? But sociability isn’t the only necessary ingredient in the changing workplace. Agility is also invaluable. Modern firms are notorious for rapid-fire corporate restructuring, and one must be able roll with the punches. According to a study done by the labor statisticians Hipple and Sok, the average employee stays with the same company for about 4.6 years. Jumping from job to job has become the new standard. Indeed, 51 percent of people stay at a given job for less than two years. That’s why interpersonal agility, or the ability to adapt to new social contexts, is essential. If you’re always changing jobs, you’ll always be working with new colleagues, bosses and CEOs. The ability to rapidly integrate yourself into a new culture is crucial. Now you know that the modern workplace moves faster than ever before and that success in this new climate requires juggling the responsibilities of teamwork as well as those of personal relationships. Okay, so how do you effectively navigate this crazy tangle? Through a new approach called generative partnership. This term describes a relationship that’s designed for you and your teammates to attain results that go above and beyond the creativity and innovation that any of you could achieve on your own. Here’s how it works: Generative partnerships are founded on leadership and followership. The difference between the two is pretty self-explanatory: a leader guides the team by framing tasks and setting the context within which the team works; a follower takes his cue from the leader, executing the tasks that the leader assigns. Unlike traditional approaches, however, a generative partnership considers both of these roles equal and dynamic. A person can be both a leader and a follower, depending on the group’s needs. For instance, take the Beatles and their hit album, Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band. While recording the album, each band member contributed his own ideas and songs. Whoever had the best ones would become the leader and the other band members would follow him. Naturally, these roles shifted from song to song and resulted in a collaborative effort that produced an incredible, innovative album, making the already famous band immortal. Their success depended on throwing out any hard rules about who was in charge, and this allowed them to adopt a fluid dynamic – going with the best ideas and doing away with hierarchy almost completely. For some people, the word “followership” is bound to have negative connotations. This should come as no surprise since we usually associate following with being underrated and underdeveloped. In organizational contexts, the word is barely used at all. But the concept of followership can add tremendous value to the work of any team, and it’s also bound to have a positive impact on corporations. Just take the work of the American researchers Philip Podsakoff and Scott MacKenzie, who studied the impact of followership on the performance of teams in various industries, from insurance to paper, pharmaceuticals to food service. Their results show that, regardless of industry, there is a correlation between adherence to followership – that is, a state in which followers easily abide by the instructions and advice of their leaders – and significant increases in performance metrics. Customer satisfaction increases, as do sales and product quality. The study even found that followership increases the majority of performance indicators by 17 to 34 percent. So followership is good for companies. It’s also great at developing leadership. After all, you can’t lead without followers. Just take Derek Sivers, an American entrepreneur and the founder of CDBaby. During a TED talk he delivered, he spoke about starting a movement. To illustrate his point, he screened a video of a young man dancing on his own, while surrounded by onlookers. In the video, another bold person eventually stands up, joining the lone dancer. Soon enough, everyone is busting a move. The point is, sometimes even a single follower can produce a leader. In the case of the dancing man, the courage of a sole follower was all it took to make all the others feel comfortable enough to get down, too. Without this follower, the lone dancer would never have been a leader at all. The successful businessman and former General Electric CEO Lawrence A. Bossidy says that, over time, great followers do more for an organization than great leaders. Why is that? Well, if the employees on the  frontlines – the salespeople and customer-service representatives – are great at following, they’ll have more successful careers. After all, success on the job is usually measured by rapid promotions and big bonuses, rewards that great followers easily obtain. Just take a study done by Thomas Ng, Lillian Eby, Kelly Sorensen and Daniel Feldman, in 2005. It found that powerful followers rapidly climb the career ladder, earn higher salaries and receive more freedom to take initiative at work. They accomplish all this by demonstrating to their leaders that they can carry out the tasks they are assigned and by supporting, as well as advocating for, the decisions that leaders make. Because of this reliability and loyalty, leaders seek out followership skills in their employees. For instance, a 2007 article called “Surviving Your New CEO,” published in the Harvard Business Review by Kevin Coyne and Edward Coyne, pointed out that traditional hiring criteria like technical expertise and leadership skills are out of date. Leaders today look for employees who are self-motivated, good at working in teams and supportive of the vision put forth by their boss. Unsurprisingly, all these traits are characteristic of great followers. And great followers are what employers want. For instance, before taking over as CEO of a subsidiary of Bell, the largest telecommunications company in Canada, Ramesh Lakshmi-Ratan spoke with each of his former colleagues, hoping to learn who would commit to his vision as head of the company. After these discussions, he selectively retained the people on his team who believed in, and were thus willing to follow, his chosen path. Today, the primary role of leaders is to facilitate collaboration. And, as you’ve already learned, this job isn’t necessarily done by the senior manager, but can actually be taken on by other, lower-level team members. But knowing exactly when to transfer leadership isn’t easy. In order to help you make this call, think of a basketball game: In basketball, even the most talented players can’t have the ball all the time. Situations inevitably arise where their path to the basket is blocked and a pass is the smartest choice. Just as star players need to learn when to pass the ball, the best leaders need to know when to hand off responsibility to other teammates who may be in a better position to score. In other words, leaders need to know when they should lead and when it’s best to pass that leadership to someone else. However, when you pass responsibility to another person depends on the situation. For instance, consider Kevin McKenna, the general manager of the Canadian multinational, Phoenix Contact. In meetings, McKenna is always an active participant, ready to learn new things and generate ideas for his team. But when the time comes to make a decision about which ideas to run with, McKenna always leaves the room, knowing that a manager's presence can disrupt the team’s creativity. To put it differently, McKenna knows when he should step back and let others lead. But how do you know when you or other leaders should take a backseat role? Well, there is no sure answer to this question; it all depends on the situation. However, adequate training is an essential part of helping leaders learn when to stand aside. That’s why it’s essential for companies to provide their leaders and potential leaders with the highest quality coaching available. Only with training will a leader have a chance of knowing when to pass the ball. The key message in this book: Followership tends to get a bad name, but actually it’s an essential and valuable trait. Followers enable and produce leaders, and good leaders know when to let their followers take control. By adapting your vision of leadership, you can increase innovation and produce better results.  Actionable advice Share knowledge with your colleagues. The next time you participate in a training or seminar, take a moment to share the knowledge you’ve acquired with your colleagues. Spreading this information will enable followers to do their jobs better, not to mention produce a growing set of leaders to guide the group. Got feedback?

And when one of the greatest soccer managers of all time starts talking about what made his teams great, you want to hear it.  Enter Sir Alex Ferguson, who won dozens of trophies with Manchester United during his 27 years in charge, who led teams that slayed clubs across England and Europe, and who has come to symbolize what it means to be a winner. His teams could play with flair and style or unsmiling discipline. They were comprised of pretty boys and hard workers alike. But, no matter who they were or what their playing style, they just about always seemed to win. How? Why? What made them so good? Obviously it didn’t hurt to have world-class players like David Beckham, Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney on board. But, even as players came and went over the years, Ferguson kept on winning. These blinks go into his leadership secrets and what he believes ensures top-level performance. In these blinks, you’ll find out why your presence alone is such a powerful motivational tool; what makes Cristiano Ronaldo so great; and how to set the right expectations for your team. We’ve got two ears and two eyes – but just one mouth. Is it a coincidence, or should we be listening and observing twice as much as we talk? The truth is that listening always pays off. It is a great opportunity to learn new and useful things – coach Alex Ferguson can attest to this. Ferguson knows the value of listening and knows it well. Just by listening, he picked up some tips and tricks that have served him for a lifetime.  For example, Notts County manager Jimmy Sirrel once mentioned to Ferguson that he was always careful to make sure that player’s contracts never expired around the same time. This helped prevent collusion against the manager and the club. Ferguson has kept that gem of wisdom to this day.  Like listening, learning to observe well will also give you an edge. This is something Ferguson discovered when his assistant manager Archie Knox suggested that, rather than running his training sessions, he should sit back and watch them.  This turned out to be a turning point in Ferguson’s coaching career. When coaching right alongside his players, Ferguson’s focus would be on the ball. By stepping back and observing his players train from a distance, the details of their performance were less visible. However, the overall patterns of their behavior, attitudes and energy levels suddenly became clear.  Still, focusing on the details can be helpful, too. As the saying goes: know your enemy. Ferguson developed a system of closely watching and analyzing footage of opposing teams before a match.  This strategy is what helped Ferguson’s team win the 1999 Champions League Final against Bayern Munich. Based on the analysis and information he’d gleaned from the footage, he was able to predict Munich’s two substitutions late in the game. He zoomed in on the details and zoomed out to the broader picture, demonstrating that flexible observational skills are indispensable for any manager.  Most of us assume that the world’s best soccer players are simply gifted from birth with skills we should never dream of having. But is that really the key to their success? Not quite.  There are a lot of talented soccer players out there, which means a lot of competition. If you want to stay in the game, you need to sustain yourself. This is why discipline is so instrumental in achieving success.  Ferguson is one of the toughest disciplinarians in soccer. When he began his career as manager at Manchester United, he first tackled particular problem areas.  Players used to wear clothes of any company that sponsored them, giving the team a rather unprofessional, money-grabbing look. Ferguson swiftly implemented a proper dress code to eliminate this. Rules regarding haircuts and jewelry were also introduced, signaling to players that a lax attitude would not be tolerated.  Discipline and determination go hand in hand, another attitude that players learned under Sir Alex. Take Cristiano Ronaldo, for example. When Ferguson brought him to United, Ronaldo’s determination to become the world’s greatest soccer player was clear as day.  This determination is what allowed him to maintain such incredible discipline. Even today Ronaldo takes ice baths after every match and keeps his weight seven pounds below his optimal weight. Strict measures such as these allow him to keep playing football at an incredibly high level despite his age.  Like discipline and determination, preparation is another key factor ensuring top athletic performance. At Manchester United, the players who performed the best during a match were always the ones who had prepared the most. David Beckham, Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney were all known to stay late after training to perfect their free kicks.  In 1996, David Beckham scored his now-infamous goal in a match against Wimbledon all the way from the halfway line. Viewers thought it was a miracle, but for Beckham it was nothing more than a prepared piece! He’d practiced the shot so many times after hours that he was able to seize the opportunity during the match.  But it’s not just players that have to think ahead – sporting organizations do, too. Fostering young talent is a long-term project.  In the same way that young people begin as trainees at a corporation with the aim of working their way up to vice-president or CEO, a young player at Manchester United works their way up from the youth academy to the B team. From there, they can graduate to the A team, then to the reserve team, and ultimately, to the first-team squad.  FC Barcelona takes a similar approach to training their young players. Here, the benefits of allowing young players to grow together over years are particularly clear. Think of the great trio of Lionel Messi, Andrés Iniesta and Xavi Hernández. Having trained together for so long, these players know each other extremely well and have an incredibly advanced and unpredictable passing game that stuns defenders! One great rule of thumb when it comes to managing a team is avoiding extremes. Whether from unrealistic expectations or big personalities, extremes can damage the close bonds of a team. Keeping your team balanced prevent extremes from creating tension.  A balanced team must have diversity and unity. Take Ferguson’s approach to the age of his team members. He didn’t want to have only young and inexperienced members, but also didn’t want only older, slightly less fit players. An equal mix of both was the best solution.  Ferguson was also careful to ensure his team had a balanced amount of creative players and dependable players. Of course, creative players are what makes a team’s attacking side so thrilling. Think of players that can overwhelm the opponent’s defense or make a sudden unbelievable sprint down the field like Cristiano Ronaldo. But a team wouldn’t survive if it didn’t have the right amount of steady, reliable defenders, too!  Team managers must also keep their expectations balanced. Ferguson learned this lesson early on in his career. After an eight-game winning streak, he declared to the press that his team wouldn’t lose a single game that season. Yet, just after this bold announcement, his team went on to lose all but one game, finishing in sixth place. Ferguson then recognized that high expectations only serve to put pressure on players. Instead of being encouraging, high expectations usually lead to a weaker performance. Whether it’s that great high school basketball coach you had or an inspiring activist, the best leaders have a special something that inspires their teams. So what’s it made of? First off, great leaders make their presence felt. Sometimes without even realizing it! Ferguson had no idea that his presence was so important to his team until he missed a few training sessions.  Rio Ferdinand, one of his players, revealed that the sessions simply didn’t have the same energy as when Ferguson was coaching. Ferguson recognized that his presence itself was a motivating factor. Over his 27 years of management, Ferguson was present at all but three of 1,500 United games.  Secondly, great leaders know that support is more effective than criticism when change is needed. Ferguson always provided criticism to help players improve their technical skills, but did so tactfully.  For instance, he’d always wait until players had calmed down after a game, rather than criticizing them immediately afterwards. And, he always presented his criticism as a form of encouragement, letting players know that he believed they were capable of better performance.  Finally, good leaders are understanding. When David Beckham was criticized harshly in the press for receiving a red card in a 1998 World Cup match against Argentina, Ferguson knew the least helpful thing he could do was to criticize Beckham like everyone else. Instead, he spoke with Beckham to let him know that he was there for him, that these things happen and that he shouldn’t let it hurt his confidence. Ultimately, Ferguson believes that the two words “well done” are the most powerful tools a coach has to help players reach their full potential. The key message in this book: Great coaches are always observing, seeking out new ways to understand and overcome challenges their players face. By encouraging discipline and determination, and taking on calculated preparation, coaches can give players their shot at success. Top performance is maintained by keeping the team balanced and supporting players with presence and praise.  Actionable advice: Deal with failure and don’t be a quitter!When you do fail, take responsibility for your failures without blaming others. Instead, figure out what you did wrong and learn from it. This is why, in general, team members that are winners take great pride and look forward to avenging defeats. Don’t forget, it’s useless to get lost in self pity.  Got feedback?

Hess","summary":"Established business leaders know that being able to learn is a key to success. But what does this mean? Being able to learn means improving and growing your skills – and in doing so, staying ahead of the pack. An individual can learn; yet the bigger challenge is getting an entire organization to keep learning. In today’s fast-paced business world, we either learn, or die. These blinks give you insight into the latest research that explains how our brains work – that is, exactly how we learn – and how you can then use this knowledge to reevaluate how your company operates. You’ll learn how to build a successful, dynamic organization based on how the human mind works. That’s bad news for your competitors, and great news for your employees and bottom line! In these blinks, you’ll discover how Toyota deals with employee mistakes; why you need a comfortable chair to learn effectively; and how to think as quickly as a firefighter. We learn as we observe the results of cause and effect in our environment. When dark clouds gather overhead, for example, you know through past observation that it may rain. Over time, such observations become a way of interpreting the world. Our learning systems are somewhat like a computer operating system – that takes more work to rewrite. Yet it’s precisely our ability to rewrite what we’ve learned that is the key to productive learning. The human learning machine consumes lots of energy, and because of this, tends to operate more often than not on autopilot – relying on instinct – to conserve fuel. We call this mode System 1. It’s in this mode that you, for example, keep your voice down inside rather than yell and scream, based on the hard lessons you learned as a child. Sometimes this mode can blind you, however. When you really need to think out of the box, such as when you’re trying to figure out why a competitor’s product is crushing yours in the market, you need to switch your thinking to System 2. The ultimate goal of a learning organization is to overcome the preference for System 1 thinking. To do so, learning organizations must help employees to process information, especially information that challenges automatic assumptions. System 1 thinking isn’t a problem with basic activities. Yet in business, it can cause you to miss trends or opportunities. A company stuck in System 1 thinking often can’t see alternatives to the status quo. In contrast, System 2 thinking helps you reject automatic responses; instead, you’re able to consider new options and temper any bias. Observing and managing the way you think is essential to actual learning. One way to get in the habit of using System 2 thinking is to simply reflect on what you’ve done during the day. This will help you to identify critical moments in which System 2 thinking could have helped. Throughout the process, remember to keep an open mind so you can turn mistakes into learning opportunities. We often – yet erroneously – separate our rational, thinking mind from our emotional mind. The truth, however, is that thinking is impossible without emotion. The areas of the brain responsible for emotions and thinking are closely networked, and even overlap. Star Trek’s highly logical Spock is, after all, a fictional character. In reality, there’s no such thing as completely logical thought. Your emotions will always affect your thoughts, and vice versa. Consider how your emotions can color your memories. Or your “gut” intuition, which isn’t really a thought or a feeling, but more a mixture of the two. Your mind, brain and body all communicate, and what is communicated affects each organ in turn. That’s why when you hurt yourself or are stressed, for example, both your thinking and your ability to learn is compromised. But that doesn’t mean that the quality of your thinking is completely out of your control. Not all emotions disrupt thinking, as we know from our evolutionary past. While negative emotions activate self-preserving behaviors, such as our fight-or-flight instinct, positive emotions enhance cognitive processing through thinking and learning, increasing awareness, exploration and creativity. So rather than rejecting your emotions, you should embrace the ones that enhance how you learn. Smiling more, expressing gratitude and reflecting on the good things in life give you a positive outlook that can ease the learning process. But managing emotions isn’t easy. Negative emotions can limit your comprehension and trigger a fear response, hijacking other functions of the brain and thus undermining your ability to change perspectives or behaviors. When we’re afraid, we become obsessed with that fear, and in turn can’t use our minds fully. You can combat fear by reframing a situation into one that isn’t so scary. For instance, if you’re afraid to deliver a presentation to the board of directors, just view the talk as a learning opportunity – and you’ll be fine. So now you know how the process of learning works. The following blinks will examine tools and methods that foster learning. So now that you know how the human mind thinks and learns, it’s time to apply these lessons to your organization. Your goal is to make your team a High Performance Learning Organization (HPLO), a place where learning is praised as a key element for success. HPLOs need to achieve three key goals: finding the right people, creating the right environment and establishing the right processes. Let’s look first at how to find the right people. A learning organization needs people who have a learning mind-set, which is characterized by a genuine motivation to learn. Our basic need to survive led to the development of behavior centered around a decision to approach or avoid things. If a thing was dangerous, we avoided it. If not, we approached it. Whether or not we take risks and learn is likewise predicated on whether we’ve learned to approach or avoid the process of learning. For example, if you’ve been humiliated by a manager after trying something new, you probably will avoid taking risks in the future. An HPLO, in contrast, aims to bring people into the organization who are motivated to learn and to help others learn. Similarly, employees should have self-efficacy, or a belief in their ability to achieve. They should see problems as a challenge and an opportunity to learn, not as something to fear. A manager with self-efficacy can cope with a major product recall, for example, knowing that he can learn from the situation to avoid it in the future. There are many reasons to learn – some are internal, and others are external. People who want to master or expand their skills and welcome feedback are fueled by intrinsic motivations. That is, learning makes them feel good! Extrinsically motivated learners, on the other hand, seek the approval of others. They want to learn to get good grades, high pay or respect. Generally more competitive and egoistic, they don’t welcome challenges and try to avoid failure, really only wanting to confirm how smart they really are. It’s clear that the sort of learners HPLOs want and need are internally motivated learners! Once you’ve found the right people, you need to cultivate the kind of environment that helps them thrive – one that fosters learning. A positive learning environment recognizes learners as individuals and provides them with autonomy and control over their learning. Role models should send employees on a journey of discovery, and challenge them. They should inspire a learning mind-set and help people cope with the fear of failure, any stress or other inhibitors to learning. A positive learning environment is one in which team leaders are evaluated on their ability to care and nurture employees’ growth. Learning organizations use things like “360” reviews (in which employees rate managers) to set financial compensation for top management. A positive environment deconstructs hierarchies. Learned deference to parents, elders or teachers can affect our relationship with authority in the workplace. Employees are often afraid to speak up, and fear the threat of a bad performance review or being passed over for promotion. But a High Performance Learning Organization (HPLO) requires an environment in which employees are invited to share thoughts, and this is only possible when employees feel safe. For example, managers can praise courageous workers who speak up or show humility by admitting their failures. Toyota, for instance, encourages its employees to be honest regarding their mistakes, which can only happen if an employee knows that she won’t be punished. Employers should be motivated to create a positive learning environment, as a space that facilitates learning also leads to high employee engagement. Typically, companies promote high engagement by taking employees’ opinions into account, giving them the opportunity to do what they do best and recognizing them for doing good work. Together, this results in more respect, self-efficacy and a positive atmosphere, all of which encourage learning. Once you’ve found the right people and have created the right environment, it’s time for the third goal in creating a High Performance Learning Organization (HPLO): establishing the right processes. The right processes are built upon effective communication. After all, learning is a team effort! Remember System 1 and System 2 thinking? The same concept applies to conversation. Often, we allow System 1 thinking to take over during a chat. We simply look to validate our beliefs and self-image, and don’t actively seek to challenge or expand our perspective. You can see clearly that System 1 thinking isn’t a recipe for learning. If you approach a conversation with a System 2 mind-set, you’ll ensure that your talk is open and honest. You should question everything, and learn from your conversation partner. In the workplace, we learn when we admit we’re wrong, or when we suspend judgment regarding others’ opinions. Unfortunately we live in a culture that values telling over asking, in that we’d much prefer to offer our opinion than ask other people about their own thoughts. “Tellers” often assume that they are imparting valuable knowledge. Here is the message they’re actually delivering: “I’m smarter and know more than you.” Instead, engage in humble inquiry and switch to “asking.” By asking questions, you demonstrate to your colleagues that you care about what they think and that you’re willing to listen and learn. To do this, you need to admit to yourself that you know much less than you think you know! Good conversations also require both a speaker and a listener to be engaged, and this means fighting distractions. Humans can cognitively process 600 words per minute, yet we speak at a rate of about 100 to 150 words per minute. As a result, we can get bored quickly. But clearly our conversation partners want us to pay attention! Give them peace of mind by letting them know that you’re present and are listening. Paraphrase their words back to them or ask for further explanation, for example. To readjust your view based on new facts – as is crucial for learning – you have to be able to conduct a critical analysis of new situations and information. Here are a few critical thinking tools that will help you improve your problem solving. First is the recognition-primed decision model. With this model, you compare your situation with situations from the past, identify which situations are most relevant to your current event and then apply the solution that worked then. This method is great when time is of the essence. For example, when a firefighter arrives at the scene of a fire, she has no time to weigh the pros and the cons of a multitude of actions. Instead, she’ll think back to a few fires she successfully fought to see what she could apply to her current situation. She’ll consider the characteristics of the fire, the layout of the building and the surrounding environment to determine quickly what to do. But some situations will be completely new, meaning you can’t rely on past solutions to tackle them. In such cases, use a pre-mortem analysis. Just as a doctor uses a post-mortem (after death) examination to determine how a patient died, using a pre-mortem approach gives you a chance to anticipate future events before they happen. When facing a situation, imagine a possible solution and then imagine that the solution was incorrect. Ask yourself, “What went wrong?” You can then examine the details that led to your hypothetical failure, and use that information to mitigate risks you might have initially overlooked. In the 1970s, planning teams from Shell Oil used a similar strategy to reduce overconfidence and prevent employees from getting tunnel vision when considering solutions. And finally, an insight process can help you discover new ideas. Slow down, suspend your judgment and ask yourself: Is there any data that contradicts my beliefs? Would a different perspective bring different answers? If I reframe my question, will I end up with a different set of answers? Are you ready to apply these lessons to your own organization? Let’s look at a couple of real-life examples and see how others have succeeded. Hedge fund Bridgewater uses drill downs to improve its learning environment. Essentially all conversations, meetings and interviews are recorded, and everyone has access. Sounds scary, right? Privacy implications aside, this strategy allows employee thinking and personal weaknesses to be easily reviewed. Colleagues can thus be brutally honest with each other and help each other improve. Sometimes business leaders may need to modify a business model or even company culture. Doing so requires a leader to establish new learning processes, and to think long and hard about how and at what level decisions are made. Accounting software solutions developer Intuit, when faced with a business slowdown, radically modified its approach by adopting design thinking – a methodology used by creatives to explore, discover and make new products. The company’s goal: to produce genuine innovation. To spread design thinking, Intuit empowered employees by giving them time to develop personal projects and by encouraging experimentation and rewarding the most promising ideas. Let’s say your company is already a market leader. You don’t need to change, but how do you preserve your position? Staying ahead means constantly reinventing your business while maintaining high levels of employee engagement. United Parcel Service (UPS) started with $100 and a bike. Each time the company expanded its services – from worldwide delivery, overnight shipping or air service – it faced hurdles that it turned into valuable lessons. UPS also transformed employee satisfaction into a science, spreading the company’s core values throughout its culture and rewarding employees with stock plans. As of 2012, UPS had a retention rate of some 90 percent! You’ll need to follow a path that’s right for your business. But whatever you decide, learning will be the engine that propels your organization toward success. The key message in this book: Individuals and organizations need to find a way to continuously learn and adapt or face professional obsolescence. But to learn well, individuals and organizations need to learn intelligently, and that means creating the conditions in which learning is easy and rewarded.

A charming character, iron will, an inspiring personality? Is there such thing as a “natural leader” or is good leadership a skill that can and, for some, must be learned? The good news is that anyone can be a leader. But stellar leadership requires constant effort and repeated learning. In fact, learning, challenging yourself and also failure along the way are at the very foundation of good leadership. These blinks lay out five fundamentals that form the basis of good, exemplary leadership. You will be guided through these steps and be given all the tools at hand to eventually learn and master this invaluable skill. In these blinks, you’ll learn that good leadership starts with believing in your potential; why you should imagine yourself as an exemplary leader in ten years; and why baseball players are very good at learning from past failures. You’ve probably known someone who’s been referred to as “a born leader,” and maybe that appellative gave you the impression that every successful leader must have an inherent gift. Well, let’s start by debunking this myth. The truth is this: everyone has the potential to become a leader. But before you become a great leader, you need to understand that this ability is already inside you and that it can be built upon. Look within and find out what you consider important in your life. Ask yourself, “What challenges have I faced?” And, “What kind of encouragement did I use?” Chances are, you have overcome significant challenges in life, and you can use these past events as ways to motivate and lead others. To really bring that into action, let’s go over the first self-coaching exercise: Before you start your day, stop and ask yourself four questions: Who am I? What do I do? How do I make a difference? What will I do today that really matters? Write down your answers to these questions on your phone or on a piece of paper, and carry those answers with you. This way, you can always refer to it if things get difficult and remind yourself of the day’s goal. This is a simple and effective way to stay motivated, accomplish your goals and gain confidence in yourself as a leader. It’s also important to remember that one of the best skills you can have is a willingness to learn. All great leaders are constantly looking for new knowledge. They work hard and remain focused on growing and gaining more skills. Take David Maister, a sought-after management consultant. He is well aware that his clients wouldn’t hire him a second time if he wasn’t constantly learning and keeping up with the newest trends. You should have a similar mind-set and know that if you want to be seen as a valuable leader, you need to always be learning. The world is always evolving and it’s necessary that you keep up with these changes. This is a challenge every leader faces, and the best of them employ two techniques to stay on the ball. One simple motto every leader should know goes like this: “Observe the present to prepare for the future.” A good leader is expected to keep an eye on the future so that they can help their team prepare for whatever lays ahead. Seeing into the future doesn’t involve gazing into a magical crystal ball. It means paying attention to the present and recognizing how today’s events will affect tomorrow. One exercise for staying prepared is to imagine what the world will be like in ten years. If you’re going to remain an effective leader, how big will your team need to be and what tools are they going to need? Will they need more diversity and better tools? And what skills are you going to need to learn to continue guiding them? Taking this imaginary journey into the future shouldn’t be an ego trip; it’s about realizing the predictions you can already make based on current trends, and finding out what you need to learn. As always, your attention should be on how you can best take care of the people around you. Remember, if you’re only looking out for yourself, not many people will jump to your assistance when the time comes – and it will come! – that you need help. As a leader, it’s your job to set the values and goals of your team so that everyone is helping each other reach those common goals. Alan Daddow used to help run the Australian agriculture business Elders, and he still remembers when the nature of his job as leader became crystal clear to him. One day, it dawned on him: His only job was to do whatever it takes to maximize his team’s effectiveness. Nowadays, when he looks back at his best leadership experiences, none of them involve doing something for himself. They’re all about doing something for a team member. Have you ever missed out on a career opportunity because you were too scared? Most of us probably have, which is why it’s never too late to push yourself further and overcome those fears. If you’re going to develop the skills necessary to great leadership, you will have to challenge yourself. After all, leaders face challenges every day, challenges that require them to step outside their comfort zone. So it’s best to seek out these challenges now and test yourself so that you can grow more comfortable. This is a good time for a baseball analogy: A baseball player will play around 162 games every season, and it will be considered a successful season if the team wins just over half of those games. Likewise, a decent batting average for a player is considered to be around 25 percent, which means they’re expected to strike out around 75 percent of the time! Leading, like playing ball, is challenging, and everyone knows it. So part of being a success is handling failures and disappointments well by using them as opportunities to learn, grow and get better. For the baseball player, this means trying to get a 30 percent batting average next year instead of 25. For you as a leader, it means continuing to challenge yourself and showing that you have the courage and determination to continue growing. It takes courage to do something that scares you or puts you in an unfamiliar or uncomfortable situation. Fear of the unknown usually keeps people from taking the plunge. But it’s a willingness to face that fear that distinguishes the great leaders from the average ones, and you can teach yourself how to take first, frightening steps. To begin with, think about how you would end the sentence, “It took courage for me to…” You’ve probably already done something that took courage, and reminding yourself of all the instances when you overcame your fears will allow you to develop and grow your courage. It’s common for people to think of leaders as being out there on their own with no one to cover their back. But this is another misconception that you should get rid of right now. If you hope to become a successful leader and reach your goals, you need to learn how to ask for help and seek support. For this skill, it’s good to develop strong relationships with your peers and those who are in a position to support you in your goals. And remember, no success story happened to a leader who didn’t have both a mentor and supporters, even if this help only came from family members and former teachers. If you’re still doubtful, think about the people who receive awards. When they get to the podium, each one has a list of dozens of people who helped make the achievement possible – whether that person is getting an Academy Award or a Nobel Peace Prize. Or how’s this for evidence: George Vaillant is a Harvard psychology professor who conducted the world’s longest continuous study of mental and physical health. He found that the most important thing in life for good health is your relationships with others. Along with maintaining good relationships, it’s also good to pay attention to the feedback you get from others. Part of creating a good working environment for your team is making it safe for them to provide feedback, and for you to be receptive and allow that information to influence your actions and behavior. Remember: this information will help you improve your skills. So after your next team meeting, find someone you trust and ask them to provide honest feedback on how your behavior influenced both the discussion and the decisions that were made. Once you receive the feedback, make sure you thank them; and once you take in the information, don’t try to defend your actions. Instead, simply use it as a way to grow and improve. It’s understandable if you want to become an extraordinary leader in as little time as possible. But if you’re serious about this goal, it’s best to take your time and remember that there are three steps to mastering anything: practice, practice and more practice. No matter how good you are, there will always be some skill in need of development. And, of course, the most important things to work on are your weaknesses. If you’re open to feedback, you might find that your presentations can be improved. For example, maybe you’ll be informed that you don’t make eye contact with audience members, which is causing people to disengage from what you’re trying to say. So be thankful for feedback received and take the time to practice making eye contact. During the next presentation, you might want to try looking up at least three times; in the following presentation, make it six times, and so on until it becomes natural. Practice and improvement take time. It’ll be a while before you get the results you’re after – but don’t give up and don’t rush things. Leadership-development programs are also a great way to continue learning and create mutually beneficial relationships. At one such program at the University of Delaware, Nick Martin and Georgia DiMatteo discovered that Nick was excellent at setting challenges for himself, though he had problems with motivation. Meanwhile, Georgia was great at motivation, but not so great at setting challenges. With this knowledge, they agreed to help one another and exchange feedback after every lesson. Okay, so now it’s time to give yourself a daily habit to ensure that you continue growing no matter how many successes you encounter. Let’s look at what Harry Kraemer does. He’s the CEO of the health-care company Baxter International, and for the past 35 years he has set aside 15 to 30 minutes to reflect on his day and determine what kind of impact he made and what has impacted him. This way, he’s sure to learn something about himself, every single day. The key message in this book: The day a great leader stops learning is the day they stop being a great leader. So make sure you stay open and curious and continue to grow and increase your skills. If you want to be someone who can offer strong and reliable guidance, it’s essential that you’re aware of the changes being made in your field. Stay informed and make sure your team doesn’t fall behind.  Actionable advice: Find a learning buddy. Next time you want to learn or improve a skill, choose a learning buddy and tell them about your goal. Set up regular times over the next few months to check in with one another so that you can share your progress and get feedback. Simply having someone who expects you to meet certain goals will increase your chances of success. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

But John Wood, a former Microsoft executive, came back from Nepal completely changed: his worldview had been challenged and he now had a strong desire to change his career completely. In Leaving Microsoft to Change the World, Wood details how, after poverty-stricken Nepal made him realize how many uneducated children needed help, he felt compelled to leave his corporate job and dedicate his whole life to opening schools and libraries in poor and rural communities around the world. These blinks reveal how Wood’s nonprofit charity organization Room to Read got started, and how he managed to make it continually expand and grow. You’ll also discover why books in Nepal have to be locked up; how a dedicated 17-year-old made Wood expand his charity to Vietnam; and how educating women will always benefit the greater community. Meet John Wood: a top executive who worked for Microsoft between 1991 and 1998. Wood enjoyed great success at Microsoft, until an eye-opening vacation in Nepal forced him to scrutinize the value of something he'd always taken for granted: education. Wood was on a hike in rural Nepal when he decided to take a tour of the local schools – and his life changed forever. The condition of the schools absolutely shocked him. Wood met with an education resource guide named Pasupathi. Pasupathi told Wood that the literacy rate in Nepal was only 30% and that he dreamed of improving the country's education system. Pasupathi then took John on a tour of a local school. The room marked “School Library” was empty. When Wood asked where the books were, he was shown a locked cabinet. The books were so precious they had to be kept under lock and key. The few books they did have weren't really fit for schoolchildren, either. One of them was an Italian edition of a book by Umberto Eco. So Wood asked if the teachers would be interested in English books, and when they said yes, he promised to send two to three hundred books along. Wood remembered his promise. When he got back to Kathmandu he emailed several of his contacts, informing them of the school's poor conditions. He asked for books and monetary donations, promising to use 100 percent of the donations to buy more children's books. He also asked people to forward the email to their own contacts. The results exceeded his expectations. Wood quickly gathered about 3,000 books to send back to Nepal. Wood felt a deep satisfaction when he sent the books to Nepal – a greater satisfaction than he'd ever felt working at Microsoft. He knew his actions had had a profound impact, so he eventually decided to leave his company and fully devote himself to education. After a second trip to Nepal, Wood decided to pursue a nonprofit career in funding schools and libraries. There was certainly a lot of work to do, as there were so many Nepalese schools in bad condition. Wood knew there were plenty of people who wanted to work for Microsoft, but few people who had the resources to help schools in Nepal. It was clear to him where he was needed. When he got back to his office, he told his boss he was leaving to pursue his newfound dream: helping to end illiteracy. His decision turned his life upside down. He gave up the security of his high-level job at Microsoft to focus on his new nonprofit, Room to Read, even though there wasn't a guarantee he'd be successful. (John had originally called his organization Books for Nepal, but he changed it when he decided to expand to other countries.) Wood's job at Microsoft had given him stock options, health benefits, a travel expense account, a car and a driver. When he decided to give all that up, he relocated to San Francisco. He figured that was the best place for him to work because it put him near potential donors – his old contacts at Microsoft. The radical changes in Wood's life also affected his relationship. He and his girlfriend now had very different aims in life, so they decided to separate. What determines whether nonprofits and charities are successful or not? Well, money, of course! Nonprofits need people who can aggressively secure investments. They need team members who won't take “no” for an answer. Fortunately, Wood had the right attitude. Whenever an investor rejected him, he'd try to change their “no” into a “not yet.” That way he might be able to get donations from them in the future. This is a critical part of building any nonprofit: Never give up on getting more investment. Wood had a good strategy for securing more funding. He came up with five principles he'd stress each time he gave a pitch. The first was connecting with the donors. Investors are usually highly educated, so Wood would personalize his pitch by reminding them of the value of their own educations. Wood would also show the clear link between donations and the positive effects they generated. He took care to show people that their money would make a meaningful difference in his organization. He also stressed the overhead. An organization's overhead is the costs required to sustain it, like employee salaries. Room to Read's overhead was only 10 percent, meaning that 90 cents of each dollar went directly to the schools themselves. The low overhead made it easier to get donations. Wood's fourth principle was passion. He emphasized how meaningful the project was to him personally, since he left a cushy job at Microsoft for it. Passion made his pitch resonate more with his audiences. Finally, Wood stressed meaningfulness. He did this by showing the long-term effects of his project and people's donations, to show them their money made a serious difference in other people's lives. Wood first became interested in Vietnam back when he worked for Microsoft, after meeting a 17-year-old named Vu on a business trip. Vu worked the night shift at the hotel where Wood was staying and wanted to practice his English. He also had a book with him: Learning Microsoft Excel. When Wood asked him about the book, Vu said he was studying computers because they allowed him and his country to connect more with the rest of the world. He believed computers were the future of Vietnam. Vu was clearly passionate, but he didn't have access to that many resources for studying computer science or English. Wood's memory of the young boy inspired him to return to Vietnam after founding Room to Read. While he was trying to figure out ways to expand to Vietnam, Wood got a call from a woman named Erin. He didn't know it then, but Erin would end up becoming an indispensable helper. Erin had gotten Wood's number from a mutual friend, after hearing about what Wood was doing in Nepal. She'd been to Vietnam for her own community work and realized how much she loved the country after she left. She was looking for a way to return. Erin wanted to go back to Vietnam so badly that she volunteered to work for Wood for free. She was confident her connections and network would help her expand Room to Read and that she'd eventually be hired full-time. And she was right! After spending a few weeks in Vietnam, she met with the Ministry of Education and set up some important contacts. John hired her right away. When Wood left his life as a successful businessman, he didn't leave everything from Microsoft behind. In fact, the skills he learned at Microsoft proved immensely valuable in his new life. Wood learned four important lessons from Microsoft that helped him with Room to Read. The first was about getting results. Microsoft had always emphasized the importance of getting tangible results, and Wood brought that mentality to Room to Read. He focused on the schools and libraries themselves and kept careful track of the exact number of books donated, the number of students enrolled and the work they were doing. These figures told Wood exactly how effectively his organization was increasing literacy. They also provided important details for attracting more investors and donors. Wood's next lesson from Microsoft was about treating employees with respect. He knew that you won't get the most out of your team if you don't treat them well. So Wood encouraged everyone to speak their minds during meetings. He'd give serious consideration to their opinions regarding Room to Read's plans, which made his employees more passionate about the project and also helped the organization itself, as it helped foster both critics and advisors. The third lesson was to be data-driven. At Microsoft, Wood learned the importance of numbers – things like year-on-year growth rate, revenue from various products and comparisons with competitors. Numbers were so important to Wood that he tested his applicants on them in interviews. He even checked if they knew the numbers posted on Room to Read's website! The final lesson was about loyalty. Wood learned what he knew about loyalty from Steve Ballmer, who’d been Microsoft’s second-in-command. Ballmer treated everyone equally, no matter what level they worked at. Wood implemented this philosophy in Room to Read. How can you expand an organization into new parts of the world without losing sight of its original purpose and character? That was the challenge Wood faced as Room to Read grew. And even if you're filthy rich, it doesn't help to just throw money at such a problem. Wood realized he had to create a local network of donors and other key players before he could expand his organization. So he held fundraisers to bring in new people, like volunteers and employees. The fundraisers also helped introduce the organization to new donors and investors. These local volunteers and employees were essential to the organization. One of them was Pasupathi, the education resource guide Wood had met in Nepal. Pasupathi now delivers books and helps organize the opening of new schools. And Wood's team didn't just deliver books and organize things – they literally helped build new schools and libraries, too! People came together for construction projects, as more buildings were needed. Also, Room to Read's strong local base helped the project gain international support, which made it easier to expand. Wood had to maintain his established contacts as he expanded, however. He knew if he focused too much on the organization's new areas, the older parts might start to suffer. So he took care to ensure that Room to Read's first branches stayed intact and kept receiving appropriate funding. He carefully monitored the original Nepalese schools to make sure they were still getting a steady stream of books, funding and other key resources, too. Did you know that two-thirds of the world's illiterates are women? That's why Wood made it a priority to create a new program specifically for them. Room to Grow is a scholarship program solely for girls. It offers scholarships to girls from underprivileged families who wouldn't otherwise be able to pay for their education. Anita, a 15-year-old from New Delhi, is one such girl. Anita's parents decided to marry her off because they couldn't afford to keep her in school. She protested, insisting that she'd bring more money to the family if she finished her education, but, unable to convince them, she had to look for another solution. With the help of a teacher, she reached out to Room to Grow. Room to Grow approved her petition and granted her a scholarship. Anita is still studying now, and she serves as a role model to her younger sister, who wants to follow her lead. That's what Room to Grow is all about: using education to improve the lives of women and foster equality around the world. And educating women isn't just about helping them; it benefits the community, too. As more women become literate, society improves. For instance, the education that girls receive directly affects their families: it's been shown that when women are kept up to date on issues in maternal health, infant mortality rates decrease. Education also helps people prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, like HIV/AIDs and other serious and preventable ailments. Finally, continued education leads to more opportunities for employment, which decreases hunger and poverty. All in all, it's essential for girls to be educated. Education for girls doesn't just help them – it improves society as a whole. Near the fifth anniversary of Room to Read, Wood took a week-long holiday. Though he'd planned to relax, he got a disturbing phone call while he was away: a devastating tsunami had just hit Asia. So Wood got back to work trying to figure out ways to rebuild schools and libraries in the affected areas. Wood knew he could turn the 2005 tsunami tragedy into an opportunity to rebuild. Fortunately, he was able to secure an interview on CNN mere days after it occurred, which afforded Room to Read the opportunity to help in the tsunami's immediate aftermath. A few days before the interview, Wood told his team to pledge to building schools in the villages ravaged by the disaster. He didn't know how the funding would arrive, but he knew he wouldn't rest until he'd helped as much as he could. Then his PR consultant got him a four-minute interview on CNN. In the interview, Wood recounted the story of Room to Read, and how it had helped libraries and schools in the developing world. Room to Read received tremendous support after the interview. Wood was stormed with phone calls congratulating him, and his organization received tons of donations in both money and books to help rebuild the region's schools. Wood learned an important lesson from this experience: entrepreneurs should think big. Even though he hadn't initially known how he'd get enough support for his goals, he announced them anyway, trusting that some sort of funding would come through. In the end, it did. His passionate vision of helping the region truly inspired people. They wanted to help, too, and they allowed Wood to reach his goal. The key message in this book: John Wood never looked back after he left his cushy job at Microsoft to devote himself to ending global illiteracy. He stayed committed to his dream, and used his passion and skills from his previous job to build an international network of people equally devoted to bringing more education to the world. Room to Read and Room to Grow have changed thousands of lives. One person really can make a difference in the world.   Suggested further reading: The Promise of a Pencil by Adam Braun This book tells the inspiring story of Adam Braun and Pencils of Promise, a charity he founded on just $25, and which has built more than 200 schools in developing countries all over the world.

Phillips","summary":"In the American Civil War, many state regiments passed through Washington D.C. on their way to the front. At every opportunity, Abraham Lincoln was there to personally inspect them. Despite the obvious pressures of being president, he took the time to see his soldiers and instill in them his vision of what they were fighting for. This example is typical of Lincoln's hands-on approach in leading his administration. He maintained close involvement with every division, from his cabinet members to the ordinary soldiers in the Union Army. Lincoln’s desire to keep in touch with his colleagues led him to actively seek them out. For example, not happy with just meeting with his cabinet colleagues at their official bi-weekly meetings, he would chase them down and hold impromptu conferences. In fact, Lincoln spent about 75% of his time meeting people from all aspects of his administration. Lincoln's method of engaging at every level of his organization is similar to the modern management technique: Managing by Wandering Around (MBWA). MBWA teaches managers to spend as much time as possible with their staff from all levels and departments. They should use this time to stay in touch with employees, gather their opinions on policy and instill in them the organization’s values. MBWA suggests that it is crucial for managers to get out of the office and meet with people on the front line of their business. Once again, Lincoln knew the importance of this. He would often leave his presidential surroundings to meet colleagues and supporters. He even went to the battlefield to comfort wounded soldiers and, as he had done during his Washington inspections, instill the courage and vision to keep fighting. Modern leaders should learn from Abraham Lincoln and go out and engage with staff from every level of their organization.  There has always been a debate about which is the better strategy: should leaders use the carrot or the stick to best motivate their staff? Abraham Lincoln proved that the best leaders use the carrot. From the fierce devotion of the Union Army to kinship of the common citizen, Lincoln inspired a loyal following through his ability to persuade, preach and encourage. A great example of Lincoln’s powers of preaching and persuasion can be found in a famous speech in which he attacked the views of pro-slavery politicians. At the time, the issue of slavery divided the American public, and many wanted to maintain it. Yet, through his words, Lincoln was able to bring people around to his abolitionist outlook. He matched rhetorical flair with a well-crafted argument, suggesting that most of the United States’ founding fathers had at one time been against slavery. By doing this, he was appealing to the audience’s shared faith in their nation’s founding principles. Lincoln won them over and, in fact, this speech greatly helped him win the presidency. Such examples show Lincoln was able to persuade the American people to side with him through the most divisive time in US history. Where others would have looked to coercion and strict discipline, Lincoln used persuasion. Yet, it wasn’t just in preaching to the public that Lincoln used his skills of persuasion. In his personal dealings with individual members of his administration, he used persuasion as a method of motivation. For example, he empowered his subordinates by making his orders sound like suggestions. This gave them the helpful impression that they were taking part in the process. Instead of being inferiors, they were made to feel like equal partners; he provided them with the confidence to continue working hard. Great leaders like Lincoln preach, persuade and reinforce rather than coerce. What's the secret of great leadership? Is it strict discipline? Or maybe luck? No, the secret of great leadership is communication. The ability to clearly convey your message to people is vital to being a successful leader. Abraham Lincoln was well aware of this. He mastered the art of communication in three crucial areas. He became adept at speaking to large audiences, communicating with individuals, and, crucially, knowing when tokeep silent. Lincoln was a superb public speaker, and many of his speeches, such as the Gettysburg Address, have become legendary moments in American history. The secret to his success in this area was preparation. Lincoln prepared exhaustively for his public speeches by writing the full texts in advance and continuously editing them right up until the moment he delivered his speech, ensuring they were the best quality. Lincoln was also aware that great leaders need to communicate beyond the public stage, so he became equally adept at interpersonal communication. His method was to use stories and imagery to illustrate his points. This meant he could easily communicate complex information with people from a range of backgrounds. This was vital in helping both civilians and military subordinates quickly understand his ideas without time-consuming discussion or explanation. Lastly, Lincoln understood that, in communication, silence was as effective as speech. He knew that he could save himself the chance of being misunderstood by not speaking at times. For example, in his presidential reelection campaign, he limited his public speaking engagements, which saved him from the risk of alienating voters who already knew his record from his first term. This helped him retain support and win a huge victory over his rivals. By mastering speaking both in public and in private, and knowing when to be silent, Lincoln became an expert communicator. When the United States was on the verge of the American Civil War, Abraham Lincoln was faced with a dilemma: he felt he needed to resupply the crucial military post of Fort Sumter, but he knew that in doing so he would likely initiate the conflict. So what did Lincoln do? First, he carefully considered his position. Lincoln knew that he couldn't be seen as starting the war as this would weaken his popularity and, therefore, his political position. Yet he couldn't afford to leave a key position under-resourced, either. So he carefully weighed the pros and cons of each decision and made sure he would be ready for every possible scenario. Only by carefully considering his position could he determine the best strategy. Then, after ensuring he had the information he needed at his disposal, Lincoln acted boldly. He decided to resupply the fort. This strategy turned out to be the best one possible. The Confederate army did indeed react by attacking the fort, just as Lincoln had predicted. But because they attacked first, they – and not Lincoln – were viewed as the aggressors. By acting in this careful but bold manner, Lincoln had both resupplied the fort and not only saved his own political position but strengthened it. This example shows one of Lincoln's greatest strengths as a leader. Rather than rush into making decisions, he ensured all his options were first carefully considered, allowing him to formulate the most intelligent and decisive strategies. This was especially vital during wartime, when a leader can be faced with many difficult decisions. In no small part this ability helped Lincoln and his administration to gain victory in the Civil War. Lincoln always carefully considered his options, meaning he was able to successfully take intelligent and bold action.  The demands faced by modern leaders don't allow them to be everywhere at once. Business leaders, for example, need to attend meetings, see shareholders and work on strategic planning. They don't have the time to manage every detail of their business. They need help, and the best form of help is independent-minded staff who can use their own initiative, leaving leaders free to do their own jobs. Yet, how do leaders find these vital members of their staff? The best leaders can employ a modern technique known as a honeymoon period to gauge their staff's effectiveness and initiative. Staff are given a period, usually between three to six months, in which to display desirable qualities such as initiative. If they don't demonstrate these qualities, then they are moved on, and new staff are awarded the chance to fill the role. This gives personnel the chance to prove themselves, while ensuring that ineffective staff aren’t allowed to block the path of better ones. Once again, Abraham Lincoln provides us with both an example of using independent-minded staff and also just how to find them. He knew he needed staff who were comfortable using their own initiative, and he discovered such a person in General Ulysses S. Grant. Lincoln found Grant after using the principles of the honeymoon period to discard several ineffective generals. In Grant, he found an aggressive and self-motivated fighter, and someone whose initiative even propelled Grant to find his own like-minded generals. His decisive victories were critical to Lincoln's success. Had Lincoln not used the honeymoon period to find Grant, he could have been stuck with ineffectual generals, making victory that much harder. Trial periods give new personnel the chance to display their initiative – and those found wanting can be quickly removed. Throughout his presidency, Abraham Lincoln was captivated with technological innovation. In fact, he is the only president of the United States to hold his own patent: a method of lifting boats over obstructions in the water. His fascination in this area was born from the fact that he knew the success of an organization depends on its ability to seek out technological breakthroughs. In order to find and exploit these breakthroughs, Lincoln ensured that his administration remained at the forefront of innovation and technological advances. For example, Lincoln was methodical in his search for new technologies and innovations, organizing and even personally attending demonstrations of new technology around Washington. He stopped at nothing to find advancements that could give the Union the advantage in the Civil War. This led him to evaluate diverse technologies, from hot air balloons – for use in spying – to flame throwers and even rockets. He also saw to it that new technologies were quickly implemented, even going so far as to override his generals in the introduction of crucial new weaponry. For example, he personally tested and ordered the introduction of a new type of rifle, despite the concerns of military commanders. In the end, this made an enormous contribution to his army’s eventual victory. In addition to his direct approach to innovation, Lincoln made sure to provide a platform for others to come to him with new ideas. He held open office-hours to allow businessmen and inventors to visit him with new proposals, such as new weapons, to help the war effort. By entertaining proposals, researching, and developing cutting-edge technology, Lincoln fostered technological development, which helped him lead his administration to ultimate victory. To exploit technological breakthroughs, Lincoln sought out innovations, implemented them and encouraged new ones. Modern business leaders are confronted by a difficult dilemma. Elements of their business, such as technology and customer tastes, constantly evolve, so businesses must react and adapt if they hope to succeed. However, making too many changes too quickly can overwhelm the employees and damage productivity. Therefore, there needs to be a careful balance between being flexible and maintaining consistency. Great managers are aware of this need for a careful balance and the ways to maintain it. The key to doing this is to first ensure a level of consistency in the organization, such as consistency in what is expected of each member of staff. A member in the sales team, for example, will feel more comfortable when they know what level of sales they should aim for, and that this level won’t be raised suddenly. Putting this consistency into action builds a strong and stable base in the organization, which in turn provides a launch pad for radical change. Leaders can be more flexible to change knowing that their staff are comfortable with their roles and workloads. Abraham Lincoln provides a great example of how a leader can achieve this balance between consistency and flexibility. He took the US government through one of the most traumatic periods in its history. Throughout the long and bitter Civil War, Lincoln had to constantly make radical changes, like abolishing slavery, to transform a civilian administration into a war-winning machine. He did this by being consistent in his actions. For example, when he promoted his staff, it was always based on the same criteria and levels of performance, and they always knew what was expected of them, whatever task they were doing. By acting this way, Lincoln managed to successfully make the changes in his government that helped him win the war. Managers must carefully balance the need for change and flexibility with stability and consistency. In the American Civil War, the punishment for desertion from the Union Army was death. Yet, many young men who ran away because they could no longer bring themselves to fight were saved from execution by Abraham Lincoln. In pardoning their desertion, he set an example to his followers and enemies alike that he was prepared to forgive their mistakes. In fact, over the course of his presidency, Lincoln granted more pardons than any other president in US history. Lincoln's forgiving and lenient image built trust and honesty in his administration. He hoped this would not only encourage his supporters to keep taking risks but also send the message to his enemies that it was safe to surrender. An example of how Lincoln motivated his staff in this way can be seen in how he was prepared to forgive his generals. He would frequently take personal blame for unsuccessful military operations, thus taking the pressure off his generals. This encouraged them to continue pursuing bold and aggressive strategies, safe in the knowledge that they would be forgiven and protected from adverse criticism if they failed. Using this approach to his enemies also brought rewards. For example, toward the end of the Civil War, a group of confederates approached Lincoln to ask if they would be executed for treason. True to his reputation, Lincoln reassured them they would remain unharmed as long as they promised to stay faithful in the future. In acting in this way, Lincoln was able to steer his confederate adversaries back toward his leadership and help heal the biggest rift in US history. By forgiving the mistakes of bothhis staff and his enemies, Lincoln built up levels of trust in his administration. The key message in this book is: Abraham Lincoln embodied leadership by quietly guiding the direction of every division of his administration on a daily basis. Through the use of persuasion, excellent communication and full assumption of his powers, Lincoln spread his vision throughout his organization. Lincoln created the strongest staff possible through trial and error, emphasizing positive reinforcement and integrity, resolving conflicts creatively, and continually encouraging innovation. In doing so, he ensured that his organization had the strength to carry out his vision. Actionable ideas from this book in blinks: Get Involved The best way to manage an organization is to get out of the office and get personally involved. Spend time with your employees, get feedback, reinforce your vision in person and convene random meetings. As a leader, interact with every department of your organization. This way, your vision will be carried out under your supervision. Try Out Employees for Positions Give new employees a trial period to prove they can excel on their own. If they can't, transfer them somewhere they can be more effective, and find someone better for the job. If, however, they can, then you've found a dependable employee you can rely on while giving yourself more time to focus on your own responsibilities. Master Communication Perfect your communication skills. A great speech or letter is the best way to remind employees of your company’s mission, inspire them to carry it out and let them know how to do so. Silence, or the art of knowing when not to speak, is an equally important form of communication; sometimes speaking doesn’t achieve anything.","headers":["Modern leaders should learn from Abraham Lincoln and go out and engage with staff from every level of their organization.","Great leaders like Lincoln preach, persuade and reinforce rather than coerce.","By mastering speaking both in public and in private, and knowing when to be silent, Lincoln became an expert communicator.","Lincoln always carefully considered his options, meaning he was able to successfully take intelligent and bold action.","Trial periods give new personnel the chance to display their initiative – and those found wanting can be quickly removed.","To exploit technological breakthroughs, Lincoln sought out innovations, implemented them and encouraged new ones.","Managers must carefully balance the need for change and flexibility with stability and consistency.","By forgiving the mistakes of both his staff and his enemies, Lincoln built up levels of trust in his administration.","Final summary"],"category":"Leadership","image_url":"https://images.blinkist.com/images/books/52bec84b3933330008010000/3_4/470.jpg","synopsis":"Lincoln on Leadership is a detailed examination of the strategies that enabled Abraham Lincoln to lead so effectively before and during the American Civil War.

Modern logistics gets products from point A to point B, and logistics clusters are the engines that keep this massive flow moving.  Determined by geography and supported by a nimble workforce and favorable governments, logistics clusters power our globalized economy.  These blinks show you just how these clusters have come to be and how they work, shedding light on the long reach of logistics into local investment, regulation and trade policy.  Yet even as established European clusters start to fade and new clusters in today’s Asian megacities rise up, the flow of trade continues, with a renewed focus on the environment and job creation.  In these blinks, you’ll also learn  how auto cluster “groupthink” killed Detroit;  why even Roman emperors knew that Rotterdam would become a top port; and which universities you need to attend to get a job in Silicon Valley. How exactly did your favorite pair of shoes get from the factory that produced them to the store you bought them in?  The set of operations needed to coordinate this complex chain of events is called a logistics cluster: a group of logistics-related business activities concentrated in a single geographic area.  Interestingly, different companies utilize clusters in different ways. Zara, a Spanish clothing retailer with over 1,500 stores across the globe, uses a logistics cluster located in Zaragoza, Spain. (Although Zara was not named after Zaragoza!) The company chose this small Spanish city as the site for a major distribution center and springboard for coordinating the company’s worldwide logistics.  Why Zaragoza? Why not a fashion capital such as Paris or Milan, or some city in China that specializes in low-cost clothing production? Zara’s distribution center is a part of Europe’s largest logistics park, called the PLAZA – or Plataforma Logística de Zaragoza – which means the logistics platform of Zaragoza.  This park boasts excellent highway, rail and air freight infrastructure, allowing Zara to deliver ready-to-sell products within 24 hours to all its European stores, and within just 48 hours, to all its stores worldwide.  Another company that benefits from PLAZA’s logistics prowess is Caladero, Spain’s largest processor and distributor of fresh fish. With its 80 fishing boats worldwide, Caladero’s distribution chain needs to be flawless: no easy task, as the company only has a few days to deliver fish to ensure freshness. So Caladero centralizes all its distributional operations at this one site, with its optimal location and transportation infrastructure.  But how does this benefit Caladero exactly? Conveniently, Zaragoza is equidistant from Spain’s four biggest cities: Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia and Bilbao. This enables the fish company to deliver the freshest fish possible to the most customers.  Silicon Valley. Hollywood. Detroit. There are countless examples of geographic areas becoming renowned hubs for a particular industry. But why do companies cluster by industry? Industry clusters provide a variety of advantages for all companies involved.  Clustering helps build trust between companies. Hollywood, Wall Street and Silicon Valley are regions known for making well-planned business decisions quickly, a major competitive advantage. The reason this happens is that all the important industry players are clustered in a single place, helping to make business connections quickly and effortlessly.  Another advantage of clustering is tacit knowledge exchange, including communicating with suppliers about specifications or discussing benchmarking statistics with competitors. Since communication isn’t always easy, clustering offers a huge advantage as it makes the process faster and more effective, especially with face-to-face or even chance meetings.  A third benefit of clustering is that it fosters a collaborative environment. As a high concentration of firms share a common industry, addressing similar needs is a natural impetus for joint activities. Companies can collaborate in a variety of ways, including lobbying the government for things like infrastructural improvements or tax breaks.  But clustering isn’t without its risks. Actually, most clusters don’t last forever – but tend to grow, mature and then decay. Why is this the case? One explanation for cluster failure is the very advantage that clustering provides. The information flow and increased knowledge that clusters enjoy can lead to groupthink, which in turn dulls the ability of companies to respond to change.  Just consider Detroit’s failed auto industry, a cluster composed of Ford, General Motors and Chrysler. These auto manufacturers were so engrossed in their own “conversation” they missed the public’s rising environmental awareness and failed to develop more fuel-efficient automobiles.  Additionally, they underestimated international competitors in Asia and Europe. And in the end, this groupthink led to GM declaring bankruptcy, and Chrysler being taken over by Italy’s FIAT. So we’ve learned the benefits of clustering in general, but what are the main advantages of logistics clusters?  One major benefit is that, as a result of increased freight traffic, carriers in logistics clusters can offer reduced transportation costs with improved service. How does this come about? Transportation services fall into two categories: direct operations (DO) and consolidated operations (CO). With direct operations, a carrier takes a shipment directly from pickup to delivery. With consolidated operations, a carrier takes multiple shipments from a local area and makes several deliveries in a destination region.  While DO services tend to be on demand, CO services are usually scheduled.  Logistics clusters offer a transportational advantage as they handle more freight originating from and destined for a single location, which leads to more CO transportation. So transport to and from logistics clusters is much faster, since time between shipments is reduced.  But DO carriers are also drawn to logistics clusters, as making a delivery into a cluster increases the likelihood of a new load to pick up and deliver somewhere else – thereby reducing empty trips.  Another advantage of logistics clusters is the sharing of resources. Most companies have peaks and lulls at different times – online retailers see a surge leading up to year-end holidays, while 1-800-Flowers.com does a lot of business around Mother’s Day, for example. As a result, warehouse operators in logistics clusters can shift overflow from one warehouse to another, if one space is temporarily at capacity while another has room to lease. Not just that, but companies can share heavy equipment such as forklifts when demanded by a sudden surge in activity. It’s easy to think of logistics as just the moving, storing and preparing of goods for transport. But modern logistics clusters offer many different services, from laptop repair to flower arranging – value-added services that go above and beyond the usual.  Logistics clusters offer an efficient location for companies to conduct last-minute product customization. Companies can store “base” products that can quickly be repackaged or have features added that usually don’t require a time-intensive process to do so.  But what makes a logistics cluster the ideal location for product customization? Conducting these value-added activities at a logistics cluster offers companies the chance to make changes right up until when a product is sold.  UPS Supply Chain Solutions, based at a logistics cluster in Louisville, Kentucky, handles the distribution of all of Nikon’s photographic equipment in the Americas. This means that UPS “kits” Nikon cameras before they’re shipped, adding accessories like batteries, chargers or promotional materials.  The possibility for last-minute adjustments isn’t the only benefit of a logistics cluster, as such centers also provide the perfect location for product repair and refurbishment.  Consider that consumers on average return 11 to 20 percent of purchased consumer electronics, things like cell phones, laptops and televisions.  When a return is made, the product is sent to a central location where it is prepared for resale by removing any customer data, resetting software and conducting tests, as well as undergoing any repairs.  Logistics clusters provide a natural location for doing this, as locations are often central and transportation infrastructure is excellent. And once a returned product is refurbished, it can immediately be sold and shipped directly.  So now you know why logistics clusters develop, but how exactly do they develop? Geography plays a major role in the development of high-performance logistics centers. Let’s take a look at four key clusters: in the Netherlands, Singapore, Panama and Memphis, Tennessee. In the Netherlands, river ports such as those along the Rhine River, as well as seaports such as those on Europe’s northern shores, have been natural loci for both ancient and modern supply chains.  Some 2,000 years ago, Julius Caesar marched legions down the banks of the Maas River and across the Rhine with the goal of expanding the Roman Empire. During this campaign, he noted just how suitable the waterways of Holland were for logistics; a fact that history would later corroborate, as Rotterdam became one of the largest, most influential seaports in the world.  In Singapore, both geography and climate inspired the establishment of a high-functioning logistics cluster. Singapore is an obvious center point for the East Asian economies of the Pacific Rim, South Asian markets and Western nations.  Not only this, but as Singapore sits on the equator, it experiences virtually no extreme weather. With its ideal location and calm seas, Singapore has evolved as a logistics cluster that today handles a fifth of the world’s maritime containers.  An ideal geographical location is also what helped push Panama to prominence as a logistics hub. The Panama Canal, completed in 1914, connects the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. This has made the canal a hub for international maritime trade, and has led to the establishment of a logistics cluster there.  Yet convenient sea lanes aren’t the only things a logistics cluster needs. Global courier FedEx based its logistics operations in Memphis for two main reasons.  Memphis’s location in the United States is just right: not too far east, but not too much in the “middle.” This means optimal flight distances and schedules to and from the coasts. Additionally, the city is located just south enough to avoid hurricanes, blizzards or prolonged periods of icy weather – making it an ideal flight logistics hub.  Logistics, in essence, is all about the flow of moving stuff from one place to another.  There are three distinct types of flows that logistics clusters manage. The first is the physical flow of products from suppliers to manufacturers to retailers. The second is the information flow, including specifications, orders and status messages. And the third is the cash flow.  How do logistic clusters manage these three types of flow? To handle physical flow, clusters need physical infrastructure. Rotterdam offers a great example.  Although the Rhine and Maas rivers comfortably handled early sailing vessels, they’re not deep enough for today’s gigantic container ships. The Dutch thus modified their natural waterways into a network of straight, deep channels, dry industrial parks and flood-preventing dikes.  These were then complemented with a series of roads, railways and pipelines that link the Rotterdam cluster to European economic centers.  So logistics clusters harness natural resources like rivers, bays and oceans to move physical goods. Importantly, to handle high volumes, such resources often need to be improved upon and developed, requiring proper investment.  Equally important, how do logistics clusters handle the flows of information and money? Information flow actually mimics the flow of physical goods: specifications, orders, delivery deadlines and various regulatory details move from retailers to distributors to manufacturers. To handle such a complex communication chain, logistics companies employ sophisticated information technology.  Cash flows have their own rhythm, too. Let’s say you’re an exporter who has just transferred your products to a carrier at a foreign port. The carrier notifies your bank that he has received the goods, and that bank tells your customer’s bank that the goods are in transit. At this point, the customer authorizes payment to you through his own bank.  As you can see, the transportation, delivery and sale of goods is a complex business which often involves multiple financial transactions. Financial firms serving logistics clusters must handle this complexity with ease.  The logistics centers of Rotterdam, Singapore and Panama are not only prime examples of how clusters benefit from geography but also show how logistics operations profit from government support.  There are several ways that a government can influence the development of logistics clusters.  First, logistics operations rely on transportation infrastructure such as roads, ports, airports and rail, all things that are often financed by local, state or federal governments.  For instance, FedEx changed its logistics hub from Little Rock, Arkansas, to Memphis, Tennessee, as the capital city wouldn’t increase its investment in local airport infrastructure.  Second, clusters usually require space, often a huge tract of cleared land. Therefore a cluster also needs government help in seeking land use permits, issuing building permits or enabling private investment.  Third, governments can help logistics clusters grow by offering companies incentives to set up shop, such as subsidized land, temporary tax abatements or loan guarantees. In both Singapore and Panama, the government offers tax cuts for companies who relocate headquarters to the country.  Fourth, governments can expedite the flow of goods through logistics clusters by designating special trade zones exempt from import duties and export paperwork.  For instance, most of the goods moving through Rotterdam and Singapore are bound for a foreign destination. If companies using these clusters had to pay import duties just to move goods through the door, they’d never be able to turn a profit.  Governments also help forge relationships between foreign logistics clusters, either promoting or often preventing free trade through diplomacy, trade agreements and regulations.  And good trade relations, especially free trade agreements, means a freer flow of goods. Because of the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, trade between the United States, Canada and Mexico more than doubled in dollar value in just over 15 years. Working in a warehouse doesn’t require highly skilled labor, yet modern-day logistics is so much more than pushing boxes around. The increasing use of technology to track and manage the movement of goods translates to a strong need for highly trained, professional employees. An increasing number of logistics clusters partner with or manage their own educational institutions that are designed to train the workforce they need.  For instance, the AllianceTexas logistics park maintains about 30,000 employees working at over 290 companies. To ensure a steady supply of workers, the park enlisted the help of a local community college that now serves as a training center.  The center focuses on training workers to become foundation-level certified logistics associates (CLAs) and mid-level certified logistics technicians (CLTs). With such certifications, a hiring company knows that a potential employee has the skills necessary to do the job. The Zaragoza Logistics Center in Spain offers advanced degrees as well as a special degree called a “master de logística” (MdL), designed to improve the capacity of the local workforce.  Knowledge-intensive industry clusters in particular rely heavily on academic institutions. A key example is the relationship between Stanford University and the University of California at Berkeley, both located near Silicon Valley. The computer science programs at these institutions feed companies a steady stream of well-educated engineers.  Since logistics management is a highly sophisticated and analytic field, universities located in logistics clusters often offer specialized degrees. Erasmus University Rotterdam offers a Master of Science in maritime economics and logistics, a degree with a focus on urban, port and transport economics. Not only do logistics clusters inspire infrastructure investments, but also these investments can produce positive economic returns for a surrounding area.  Logistics clusters are huge job creators, which helps to diversify a local economy and foster economic growth.  Logistics centers create jobs for both skilled and unskilled labor alike. The port of Rotterdam, for example, has 55,000 direct employees and 90,000 indirect ones. Memphis international Airport has created 220,000 jobs for the local economy, 95 percent of which are related to cargo operations.  The best part is, logistics clusters provide jobs for all types of workers. At the low-end, clusters need truck drivers, forklift operators and warehouse workers. Clusters that offer value-added services also  need electronic technicians and assembly workers.  In fact, many clusters successfully recruit entire companies to move their headquarters to the cluster’s location, bringing with them various corporate jobs such as marketing, strategy and management.  Clusters also inspire economic diversity and growth. In fact, diversification is the most major qualitative difference between logistics clusters and other industry-specific clusters.  The success of the city of Detroit rose and fell with changes in the American auto industry. In contrast, a logistics cluster supports economic activity across multiple industries, each of which is subject to its own business cycle.  For instance, the logistics cluster in Louisville, Kentucky, distributes spare aircraft parts, cell phones, office equipment, digital cameras, shoes, pharmaceuticals and many other items.  Rising employment and a constant flow of goods means that logistics clusters have a pronounced effect on a region’s gross domestic product, or GDP.  For example, about 10 percent of GDP in the Netherlands is a result of logistics activities. In fact, the port of Rotterdam alone contributes some $22 billion a year to the country’s economy. Logistics clusters reflect the dynamism of global economics and are always evolving. This will lead to the formation of new clusters in emerging economies while existing clusters gradually decline.  New clusters will find fertile ground in emerging markets. Some 2 billion people are enjoying rapidly rising living standards in the BRIC countries of Brazil, Russia, India and China as well as in the CIVETS countries of Colombia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Egypt, Turkey and South Africa.  Rapid economic growth and large populations offer prime conditions for new, large-scale logistics clusters. In China, new clusters are developing in Beijing and Shanghai, as well as in Shenzhen, where UPS maintains its North Asian center. As of 2012, Shenzhen announced plans to build one of the world’s largest logistics centers, investing some $46 billion to do so.  The world’s megacities – Chongqing, China, with 32 million people; Mumbai, India, with 21 million; and Mexico City with 21 million – will lead to clusters designed to serve the needs of these massive populations.  These new clusters however couldn’t grow without existing ones phasing out, a fact that means many existing clusters are transitioning to more sustainable methods of transport. For instance, an increased concern about fossil fuel use and overall environmental sustainability has affected supply chains as well as logistics clusters.  The huge carbon footprint of freight transport has made logistics clusters a prime target for government environmental regulations. But this shouldn’t be seen as limiting, as environmental controls can lead to technological development, making logistics clusters often early adopters of “green” technologies.  FedEx is actively testing and using some dozen different combinations of sustainable fuels and vehicles – everything from biodiesel to natural gas to electric vehicles.  In fact, the company has partnered with many car and engine manufacturers to develop, test and implement “green” technologies for high-volume logistics.  The key message in this book: Logistics clusters offer many advantages to companies while spurring economic growth for the local economies in which they operate. A cluster’s path to development is marked by prime geography, strong infrastructure and supportive governments.  Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

These words still have a lot of negative connotations: egregious CEOs, money-grubbing executives and soul-destroying offices.  This is understandable. Ruthless behavior and a winner takes it all philosophy used to be at the heart of the business world. However, as these blinks will show you, that era is long gone.  Being compassionate, truly getting to know your colleagues and striving to create a more friendly and humane workplace are now the keys to success. Ultimately, it’s about reintroducing love into business. But how do you do it? These blinks will show you. In these blinks, you’ll learn why your fancy MBA is no longer enough; how Intel made computer chips sexy; and why compassion is the secret to a better workplace. Everyone knows that love is a fantastic feeling, so why not introduce it to the job market? This might seem odd, but love is especially crucial today when an Ivy League education isn’t enough to secure you the job you want and need.  It’s true, a flashy degree from a well-renowned university was once the ticket to a lifelong career in which knowledge learned on the job was enough to get by on. But times have changed and, in job centers like Silicon Valley, people are paid according to what they know, not their job experience or alma mater.  So what’s the ticket to success in the workplace of tomorrow? A killer app is a revolutionary idea that transforms its surroundings. And today’s killer app is love.  But not love in the sentimental or physical sense – love in business, which involves smartly offering your three intangible qualities: knowledge, network and compassion. First, knowledge is all the information you’ve gained and will continue to gain, whether you picked it up at school, work, or taught it to yourself. Second is your network – your web of relationships and potential collaborators. Your network lays the foundation for your success because without it, you can’t apply your knowledge. Last is compassion, your ability to warmly attend to those around you in a way that supports their growth. This last quality is key because the way people feel about you is much more important than the way they think about you. In fact, these three intangibles are so essential that most passionate and successful people have already adopted them. These people are called lovecats. Basically they’re high achievers who have left the loveless ways of yesterday’s economy behind them, along with its aggressive vocabulary of predatory marketing, first-mover advantage and capturing market share. For instance, Cisco’s metric for success is the quality of its customer relationships, not its victories over competitors. The evidence for this lies in Cisco’s basis for giving their salespeople bonuses, a decision marked largely by customer satisfaction, not sales. OK, so being a lovecat is central to succeeding in today’s job market, but what does that really mean? Well, being a lovecat gives you six essential benefits. First, it helps you build an exceptional brand for yourself. Whether it’s Michael Jordan, the iPhone 6 or CNN, people trust and like a solid brand. That’s because without a brand, you’ll just seem like a person doing something that hasn’t yet been automated. Branding is key to setting yourself apart from the crowd.  The second advantage you’ll gain is the ability to create an experience. This is important because to earn customer loyalty and the right to charge premium prices, companies need to do more than offer a service: they need to spark interest and amusement. A great example is the way Intel has built a fun image around what’s actually a boring business: computer chips.  But it’s not just products that can benefit from creating an experience; the same is true for people. So to make an impact, it’s essential to create an experience that remains in the memories of your peers.  The third benefit of being a lovecat is people’s attention – one of the scarcest resources in the world.  Fourth, you’ll emanate what’s called the power of positive presumption. This is important because people are usually afraid of change, making it all the more essential to gain their trust by being a lovecat. When people trust your recommendations you’ll find it easy to win any debate and make any change.  The fifth benefit is exceptional feedback. This one is simple: when you offer more than just money to the people you do business with, you’ll receive more from them. This could mean business tips, job leads, ideas, contacts and much more.  The final pro of becoming a lovecat? Personal satisfaction, because you can’t be happy with your life if you’re not happy with your job. When you’re beaming out business love you’ll feel genuinely satisfied. Everyone has had a colleague who strolls down the hall offering people high fives and fake laughs. While people like this might be popular around the water cooler, they don’t offer more than a few jokes and really just end up wasting people’s time. You must avoid being that guy. Instead, be the knowledgeable guy, a move that will propel your career forward. It’s simple: just learn enough that you can share your knowledge with others. This works because knowledge is powerful and consequential. Being able to offer it will give your career the edge it needs to advance.  So, instead of putting on a show at the water cooler and going on and on about the latest reality TV show, share what you learned about disruptive technologies from Clayton M. Christensen’s The Innovator’s Dilemma. The difference will be clear.  But how can you become knowledgeable? The best way is by reading books. Don’t scour the news, which will only give you an awareness of what’s going on today, or obsess over magazine articles that tend to be commercial vehicles full to the brim with obnoxious advertising. Instead go for books and you’ll get an in-depth understanding that challenges your perspective. But magazines and articles hold some benefits, so split your time accordingly by giving them 20 percent and books 80 percent. To decide which books to read just identify the right content to help you be the best at what you do. If you want to be a banker, you should pick the best books on investment strategies. By reading them you’ll stand out at any meeting as you make valuable contributions to the conversation. Now that you know that knowledge is crucial, it’s time to learn a few practical steps to make that knowledge work for you.  Gathering knowledge is as simple as identifying your ideal learning environment and following a few easy steps. That’s because finding your sweet spot for reading will improve the investment of your time. It might be a plane, a park or even your bed. Maybe you’ll even decide to quit driving to work and enjoy an hour-long reading session on the train. So, the next time you’re waiting for a flight, don’t fall into the same pattern as the other passengers who lazily stare at their phones, creeping ever closer to obsolescence. Instead, pick up a book! Once you’ve found your favorite place to read, you’re ready to learn the three steps to accumulating and sharing knowledge.  The first trick to reading a book is to encode it, which means actively reading so you digest everything. A good strategy is to always write while you read. In fact, oftentimes when you underline something slowly you’re also forced to reread the sentence, thereby aiding your memory. The second step is processing, which means being certain that you’ve properly taken in everything you’ve highlighted. You can do this by going over major sections before moving on, thereby enhancing your comprehension. Another great strategy is to commit to a once-weekly review of one or two past books. The last step is application, a time during which you share your newly gained knowledge at work. First it’s essential to know what you’re going to share by visualizing a discussion. When you put down your book, be sure to summarize the key points in your head. For instance, say you just finished the classic How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie. Now you’re capable of giving advice on how to remain likable, even when the going gets tough. Then, once you start a discussion, you can identify ideal moments to add value to the conversation. You’ll find that discussions are full of entry opportunities, like when someone shares a problem, asks a question or states a concern. We’ve all been there, sitting in an airport terminal watching droves of businesspeople waiting alone to catch their eighth flight of the month. Clearly, in a world like this, professionals are missing intimate connections to one another. In fact, when you’re focused on your career it’s normal to feel lonely, and as though you have nobody with whom you can share your feelings or look to for support. But all that can change. One problem could be that businesspeople, because of their personal shortcomings, can be reluctant to begin business relationships. However, striking up a conversation with a potential business partner is much less risky than, say, asking out a total stranger.  After all, business people already know what they’re in the market for and are always looking to expand their networks, whether by seeking out new investors, partners and employees, or tracking the competition and current trends.  So, a fear of rejection shouldn’t be the limiting factor here. Especially when you consider what’s at stake: the potential for each new relationship to spur new connections that further expand your network. That’s because every new contact you make is one more person you can call up in case of a crisis or opportunity. Just think of all the people who land jobs based on the recommendations of their friends. But additions to your network can also build your confidence. For instance, do you remember when you could walk into a party and know everyone there? How empowering that felt? Well, a strong network can give you a similar feeling of assurance. However, there is a chance that people will use your network connections for their own benefit without showing the least bit of gratitude. But don’t worry about it; the bottom line is that it didn’t cost you a thing. So, while you may not gain anything, you didn’t lose anything either. Just remember that you’re in the business of sharing business love, and that means never saying, “You owe me.” Now you know the importance of a good network, but how can you build your own? The first step is to be a collector. Collectors optimize the organization of their contacts by using a simple system to look up names. For example, you could break your contacts into five groups: co-workers, customers, prospects, family and friends.  Being a collector also means always having business cards on hand, constantly exchanging them with others and storing all the cards you receive in a dedicated place.  The next step to being a collector is the input stage. It works like this: Collectors are always applying themselves to building their contacts, and that means keeping track of everything. So, after meeting someone it’s important to record all potential weak ties – pieces of personal information that might seem irrelevant but can start a new conversation at the next meeting. This could be anything from a hobby to a favorite sports team. And remember, always email a new contact to say what a pleasure it was to make their acquaintance. The second step is to connect people. But you can’t just randomly pair people and waste their time with poor matches. So, to succeed you need to focus on people’s value: what they do, offer and need. For instance, maybe one of your contacts just lost his financial director and you know the perfect person for the job. But it’s also critical to do this quickly. If you take all week to come up with a name you’ll arouse the suspicions of your contacts as they wonder, “what’s this guy really up to?” Then, once you make a connection, step back and only stay involved until the relationship can support itself. You don’t want to end up as an intrusive middleman – a character notorious for creating friction. Just get out and let your contacts know you’re doing so. By being upfront you’ll demonstrate a commitment to their success without any personal expectations whatsoever. Most people find workplace intimacy uncomfortable, but knowledge and a strong network aren’t enough to win hearts and earn business. In fact, being compassionate is the new key to business world success. But don’t worry, there’s nothing scary about compassion and closeness. So, while nobody wants to be the embarrassing “hug guy” in the office, there’s really nothing to fear. As long as you’ve pre-established your credibility through knowledge and a great network, compassion will just be the cherry on top. In fact, compassion can have a serious impact in the workplace. Would you want your kids to go to a school that separated them into dehumanizing cubicles? Definitely not, and you should feel the same about adult workplaces. That’s because compassion can totally transform the way people see you and themselves when it brings the warmth of humanity into an otherwise cold environment that rarely celebrates it and deems physical contact off limits. So, by showing compassion you can provide a service that few others do: you can be the person that makes others feel good. Even a simple smile can lighten the day of your entire department. Ultimately, this will mean a better experience with your business partners as compassion becomes catching. Not just that, but being compassionate will also make the experience you create more memorable, something you’ll struggle to achieve by conducting business as usual. That’s because, “please sign here” and “thank you, Sir” don’t exactly leave a lasting impression. Instead, try things like, “I love you dude. You’re a rock star.” So while you could get into the good graces of others by simply sharing favors, striking deals and giving handouts, feeding the greed of your business partners will be difficult to sustain. A more lasting strategy is to care for others by offering kind words – a compelling action that no one will forget. So, compassion is the ticket, but how can you cultivate it? Well, just as a vocal coach can help you hit new notes, practicing compassion can improve your ability to feel other people’s needs. Start by developing your sensory instincts. First, pay attention to body language by being observant. Notice how your colleagues respond when someone walks into a room. Do they go for small gestures like a pat on the shoulder or grander ones like a big warm hug? As you watch your colleagues, you’ll notice that some are immediately approachable and others are not.  The second key is timing. It’s important to listen for cues that tell you it’s the right time to bond.  Now you’re ready to express your feelings and there are lots of ways to do so, like looks, words and gestures. For instance, you can make a point of establishing real eye contact with people, or train yourself to smile when greeting or speaking with others. Be sure to avoid phony grins, because they’re actually worse than a blank expression. Another tip is to use warm words. Try replacing “good job” with “I truly appreciate the work you’ve done.” Lastly, use the power of a good hug to convey positive energy and perfect your handshake by copying the handshake style of the person with whom you’re shaking hands. Now that you know how to share your feelings, it’s just a matter of finding the right opportunities to do so. For instance, salutations offer a great opening because every time you say hello or goodbye you get the chance to express yourself. So, seize the occasion and practice Dale Carnegie’s advice: call people by their name and make them feel good about themselves. And if you face rejection, don’t manically try to make things right. Instead, wait for the right moment and keep practicing. You’re sure to improve with time, and eventually you’ll see that rejection is a small price to pay for the moments in which you make your colleagues brim with joy. The key message in this book: Love is the path to business success in the twenty-first century, and there are a few tricks for spreading that love around. By generously offering your knowledge, network and compassion to your business partners and colleagues, you can radiate love, create positive relationships and earn yourself the success you deserve.  Actionable advice: Take specific notes on every new contact to prepare yourself for your next meeting.  When building your network it’s essential to be specific. If you just met a new person, had a great conversation and got their business card it’s not enough to write generalized notes like “He works for X company and does Y.” Instead, take personal notes on the skills and interests of your new contact to help you strike up a conversation the next time you meet. For instance, “Tyler Durden was sitting next to me on a flight to Newark while I was reading about brand leadership. We started a conversation about his soap company and it turns out he’s also into boxing.” Suggested further reading: Start with Why by Simon Sinek Start With Why gets to the bottom of why certain people and businesses are far more innovative and successful than others – even in situations where everyone has access to the same technology, people and resources.

Usually the things that we are most scared of (snakes, spiders, heights) are the things with the capability to kill us. Our fear keeps us from venturing too close to them and thus being injured. However, despite its ability to keep us alive, fear can also hold us back. How? Because fear keeps us from exploring the unknown or trying something new. Unfortunately, if we want to succeed in the modern world, where things are changing all the time, we need to constantly step outside our comfort zone in order to keep up. If we allow our fears of the new to dominate we will be left stagnating and unhappy. But how do we overcome those natural fears? These blinks will provide the answer. In these blinks you’ll discover why being persistent is better than being intelligent; and why being paranoid can help you stay one step ahead. You’re at a meeting with an important client, but he is no longer happy with your product and wants to cancel your contract immediately. What do you do? Panic and beg him not to drop you? Or resign yourself to the loss of business? You could do neither. Rather than letting your emotions dictate your actions, you can instead approach problems rationally by using the FEAR method: Focus, Engage, Assess and React. Start by focusing on your problem, studying it closely before engaging and taking appropriate action. Ask yourself: How threatening is this problem really? And does anyone on your team already have experience of solving a similar problem? Is it possible to find a way to improve your product or service according to the client’s wishes? Or might it be better to simply drop this client and search for new ones? If this has happened before, how did you resolve the situation? After you have made sufficient preparations, it’s time to develop an action plan. Analyze which resources you’ll need, and what steps you must take to reach your goal. This could mean, for example, developing new technologies for your client which no other provider can offer. Once you’ve begun implementing your action plan don’t forget to assess outcomes and react accordingly. Always analyze the results of your plan. Are they satisfactory? If not, what are the underlying problems, and what can you learn from your mistakes? If your plan has delighted your customer, that’s great. But if not, what else do you need to do to stop him from searching for a new service provider? Once you’ve assessed your plan’s weaknesses, it’s time to tweak your plan until you’ve solved the problem. By differentiating opportunities and risks, the FEAR model provides you with a good opportunity to assess emotional situations objectively and produce the best outcome. Some people seem to take risks all the time without the slightest sense of insecurity. But how do they do it? No one is born with unlimited courage. Rather, it’s a skill which can be learned. Because having courage doesn’t mean that you don’t have fear. Instead, it simply means that you’re being practical and realistic. Courageous people carefully analyze risks before taking action. They also learn from their mistakes, and constantly recalibrate their next moves to make them more effective (and less risky). If you undergo this process enough times, you’ll become resilient, that is, you can turn adversity into positive feedback. Psychology professor Martin Seligman explained it in Harvard Business Review quite simply: Imagine Douglas and Walter both lose their jobs. Douglas is courageous, and thus sees his predicament as a temporary stumbling block. He analyzes his earlier mistakes, looks for the jobs he can reasonably get and finds a new opportunity shortly after. Walter, however, is full of fear. He therefore blames himself for his situation, becomes depressed and unable to move on. If you don’t want to end up like Walter, you’ll need to train your courage by taking small risks. Willpower, i.e., the force behind courage, is like a muscle – when you exercise your willpower, you strengthen it, and thus increase your tolerance for risks. In practice, this means seeking out new opportunities at work, and getting involved in projects that test and expand your capabilities. As you surmount these small challenges and learn from your experiences, you’ll simultaneously be preparing yourself for bigger, more serious challenges in the future. So the next time you see an opportunity, analyze the risks and then take a chance! If it goes wrong, you can at least say that you learned something from it. Fear is a destructive force. It distracts us from our goals and erects barriers that negatively impact our choices. To overcome these barriers, you’ll need to practice mindfulness, that is, being aware of when you feel discomfort or anxiety, and taking the time to pause and assess your situation. As soon as you recognize your fears for what they are, they immediately lose their power over you, because now you can start working on them objectively. The next time you find yourself getting worked up about a big presentation, take some time to analyze why you’re feeling so anxious. Is it because you don’t like speaking in front of people? If you know that, then you have an opportunity to practice your presentation with a friend. If you’re unsure whether the facts you present are correct, then you have an opportunity to get feedback from colleagues to double-check your work. By adopting this strategy, you effectively turn your worries into sources of feedback. In other words, your fears become learning tools. Indeed, fear does have a positive side: it keeps us alert and open to potential signs change in important areas, be they markets, customers, relationships, etc. In this way, fear helps us consider problems before they even occur. This gives us an opportunity to prepare our mind for possible upcoming challenges and think up creative solutions. For instance, artists, who rarely have a stable income, always have to worry about where their next paycheck will come from. As a result, they must be creative to offer their audience what it wants. It is this forced creativity that has driven the band OK GO to not only produce music, but also run a record label, develop apps and produce videos. Accept your fear for what it is: a normal response to stressful situations that you can use as both a learning tool and a source of motivation. Fear takes many different forms, one of which is paranoia, the suspicion of being outperformed and outmaneuvered by competitors. As with the fear of failure, paranoia can also be translated into signals which can help you to assess your situation. First, analyze whether competitors actually represent a real threat, and under what circumstances. A good way to do this is by asking yourself tough questions: What would happen to your company if the economic conditions changed? If new technologies arise, or a competitor cuts prices? If the answers to some of those strategies make you feel uncomfortable, think of some strategies to tackle possible problems and develop some back-up plans. Never let yourself feel too safe; it’s easy to become complacent if you’re not careful. You’ll want to be like the legendary skateboarder Tony Hawk. As he grew older, he realized that his career in sports couldn’t last: there were always new, up-and-coming skateboarders ready to take his share of the market. So he decided to enlarge his business interests and keep himself relevant, developing his own brand of clothing and sports equipment, and endorsing a video game series. Having established a self-assessment system, your mind will be primed for innovation, always trying to stay one step ahead of the competition. It is this mind-set that is the ultimate driving force for successful businesses, as they can foresee problems well in advance, resolve them before they become unmanageable and foster growth opportunities. P&G, for example, is able to continually improve its disposable Pampers diapers because it knows that competitors are following its lead and waiting for the company to falter. This means that Pampers must constantly produce new improvements, such as leak-proof waist shields, that have a lasting impact on the market. As we’ve seen, failure is a valuable part of learning for future projects. However, this means nothing if you don’t have the will to actually carry through your goals. Sustaining interest in a long-term goal and maintaining your efforts to achieve that goal require grit. Grit demands a great degree of self-control. To achieve your goal, you need to prepare a solid plan which includes all the steps you’ll need to take to get there. But you also need the persistence to carry your plan through – to never give up – and a tolerance for any small adaptations that have to be made along the way. Grit is absolutely important in determining your success. In fact, according to the six-month-long study that psychologist Angela Lee Duckworth conducted with West Point cadets, college undergrads, working adults and Scripps National Spelling Bee contestants, persistence and perseverance are more important than IQ or GPA in determining success. But having grit doesn’t mean taking every single hurdle in your path head on. You still need to make sure that your actions aren’t going to harm you in the long run. Instead, you want to take healthy risks that push your boundaries without extending yourself far beyond your capabilities and qualifications. You can have all the grit in the world, but you still need to weigh potential losses against potential gains. Only then can you know which opportunities are worth taking and which are just too risky. For example, Phil Gordon, professional poker player and owner of the app maker Jawfish Games, always has two experts test his apps before he puts them on the market. Sure, this might be costly, but the feedback gives him an idea of whether the apps are actually worth making available to the world. Becoming a daredevil doesn’t mean being free from worries. Rather, it means objectively scrutinizing challenges and making the right bets. It seems like everyone is looking for some magical formula for success. Luckily, such a formula exists, but we tend to overlook it due to its simplicity. All we have to do is try, learn and try again, despite uncertainties and anxiety, until we succeed. Indeed, with enough attempts and enough time, sooner or later you’ll stumble upon a successful innovation. This, of course, means dedicating time to tinkering and experimenting with your ideas, and likely failing in the process. But failure and experimentation are intertwined: the more you experiment, the more your failures will point you toward a successful solution. Often this requires a shift in mind-set, one that requires you to see your career or organization as a constant work in progress. You want the flexibility to adjust course when necessary, and this means adopting an attitude that can handle change. It’s this very principle that pushes companies to release beta versions of their products before release, to let the public test and scrutinize them, and detect problems on the spot. This open-minded attitude to development ends up saving a lot of money in the long run. When unforeseen challenges do arise, it’s time to improvise. You don’t need to be a genius, just ingenious. Your improvisational talent is worth more than intelligence when decisions have to be made quickly. Today’s young people are becoming experts in this way of thinking. The business world is undergoing a generation flux: a new cohort of young professionals has entered the workforce, one with the talent to adapt to various circumstances, make fast decisions and think outside the box if needed. Even if your business is successful and relevant, there’s no guarantee that it will always be that way. In today’s dynamic markets, relevance is more like a condition than a quality, so you’ll need to keep changing to remain valuable to customers! The key for sustaining relevancy is constant reinvention. In order to recognize and take full advantage of opportunities, you must always be willing to change and adapt yourself. Becoming an expert in reinvention means learning new skills and keeping your finger on the pulse of market trends. In fact, in business a qualification that you earned from six-months’ of evening classes can be worth more than a PhD (both on your CV and in practice) because it underlines your willingness to adapt to new challenges and your ability to learn fast. Workers and managers who can’t keep up-to-date with changes in market trends will quickly find the quality of their work slipping, while their skills and qualifications become obsolete. The same applies to companies: they too must constantly be on the lookout for opportunities to gain a competitive advantage, e.g., with products or processes, in order to stay relevant. This can pose a huge problem for large enterprises in particular, as they often aren’t designed for change. Moreover, new adaptive strategies often fly in the face of convention. But it is possible! Take the drugstore chain Walgreens, which had to deal with decreasing consumer spending and growing competition. To combat these trends, it implemented a whole new concept of customer service, including a mobile app and pill reminder and one-stop shops complete with a new assortment of healthy food, manicure services, and so on. If your company can’t undergo huge changes, small adjustments such as regular brainstorming meetings can help push you in the right direction. As we’ve seen, change isn’t always easy to welcome, but in order to stay innovative and successful we have to find ways to deal with it and see it as an opportunity. The key message in this book: “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” This is a mantra that so many live by, and it’s the mantra that will kill your business. Today’s companies need to be on a constant lookout for opportunities, and to be prepared to take calculated risks before things breakdown. Otherwise they risk being left behind. Actionable advice: Ask yourself the tough questions. Most people feel stress about their performance at work, wondering whether they are actually valuable to their company. Whether or not that’s true can be easily assessed by asking a few simple questions: Are you taking all the opportunities you can? And are you constantly learning and taking on new projects which could expand your capabilities? If yes, then your company should be happy to have you as an employee. If not, then it’s time to start taking risks!

Your first computer? What about your first Microsoft Word document, or whatever you used for word processing? Remember that tingly mix of excitement and curiosity? That, “I’m not sure what this is, but I like it?” sensation? Well get ready, because that sensation is about to return. It won’t come from computer gadgets, but from manufacturing. Just as printers allow self-publishing, and laptops perform complex calculations, soon we’ll all be manufacturing things at home. These blinks will show you just how close we are to another technological revolution. This time it’s one that allows almost anyone to sit at home, download a file and “print” – or manufacture – a toy, a product, a device or whatever your imagination can cook up. In these blinks, you’ll discover why this new technology could reverse decades of outsourcing; how one company reached its $100,000 targeted funding in two hours; and how the author could download his daughters some new toys. People have always made things. Today, however, Makers are designing things on computers and manufacturing them at home without physical resources, using digital tools. What’s more, they share their ideas in online communities. The DIY spirit of the punk and web era has arrived in the form of manufacturing, where instead of relying on large corporations for goods, people can create them themselves. For example, when the author’s daughters wanted new furniture for their dollhouse, they found the selection available from classic toymakers to be very limited. While they did find the Victorian sofas and chairs they wanted, they couldn’t find the right size. So, the author searched the web, and found a website offering online design files for dollhouse furniture. There, he found designs for Victorian furniture and modified the files so that they fit the size of his daughters’ dollhouse. But having the designs isn’t the same as having the furniture. So, he simply printed the files on his 3D printer – for free. The Makers are empowered by the web’s culture of sharing and collaborating. Open source software, for example, enables people to write and modify software to fit their own needs for free instead of getting mass-produced, one-size-fits-all programs that don’t always meet the needs of the user. Just like the chair and sofa designs that the author found online, people actively design things that were previously unavailable and make them available for others. Then anybody with the know-how can modify the files and improve them.   We see this exemplified by the micro-culture and community that has arisen around creating weapons for toy manufacturer LEGO. LEGO itself doesn’t make toys that resemble contemporary weapons, like assault rifles or grenade launchers. So, hobbyists design them online, where they can be shared and modified. These toys are then manufactured using 3D printers at home or by sending the files to online manufacturing services. Some people even turned this hobby into a legitimate business, such as the LEGO weapon manufacturer BrickArms. If you’re an inventor, then you know that we’re in a golden age. Whereas in the past inventors depended on large manufacturers to turn their dreams into reality, today they can produce prototypes from their own homes. According to Moore’s Law, there is a strong tendency for computer hardware to get both cheaper and more powerful over time. This is due to something called compound learning curves, whereby even incremental improvements lead to huge benefits. As a result, innovations follow extremely quickly, with breakthrough discoveries happening about every three years. We can see this in action when we look at the world’s first desktop laser printer, Apple’s LaserWriter, released in 1985. Though expensive, it marked the beginning of widespread desktop publishing. A mere 30 years later, anyone can have their own fast, high-quality laser printer for less than $100. Following this same trend, 3D printers and other digital manufacturing tools will only become cheaper with time, and more of us will have them at home. 3D printing today is at the same point as Apple’s LaserWriter in 1985. It’s still expensive, but it’s getting cheaper, and more people are using and adapting to it. The adoption of 3D printing is analogous to the first desktop publishing tools a few decades ago (think Microsoft Word). When desktop publishing first became available, people realized that they didn’t have a clue about things like fonts or formatting. The same thing is happening with online manufacturing. It’s still new, and people are struggling to understand the languages of industrial design, such as G-code (a programing language that tells computerized machine tools how to make objects) or rasters (programs that convert images to pixels or dots). Only a few people experiment with these cutting-edge tools now, but it is only a matter of time before they become mainstream. Every inventor or start-up founder knows that they’re going to have to raise money if they want to make their idea a reality. Normally, start-ups have to raise funds with the help of venture capitalists or loans to manufacture their product, but crowdfunding changes all that. Kickstarter, for example, turns sales into “presales” by letting people contribute money to a nascent project. In other words, people pay to be the first to get their hands on the product. Start-ups can use that cash the same way they would loans or venture capital in order to cover their initial costs. In addition, crowdfunding sites transform customers into supportive communities. When you support a Kickstarter project, you’re supporting a team of producers, whom you can communicate with in forums and who will update you on their progress. This constant communication fosters participation from supporters, who feel more involved. This involvement can translate into action, and supporters might even help a project go viral by sharing it or spreading the word to people they know. Take the extreme example of Pebble, a smartwatch start-up. Within a span of two hours it had reached its fundraising goal of $100,000. By the end of the day, it had reached $1 million, and within three weeks $10 million! All of this was only possible because of their excited and engaged online supporters. What’s more, crowdfunding sites provide free market research, making new ventures less risky. If you don’t reach your funding goals with your crowdfunding campaign, then you know that your project simply didn’t capture people’s interest or meet their needs and preferences. It’s much better to learn that lesson during the funding phase of your project than after you’ve put in an order to start manufacturing. Instead of having wasted money on manufacturing equipment and product development, you won’t have lost a dime! It also gives you an opportunity to fine-tune your project to better match the needs of potential customers and then try again later. If you’ve ever been to Detroit or Toledo, it becomes depressingly clear that manufacturing has been outsourced for decades. Today that’s all changing. Digital manufacturing techniques make it possible for developed countries to compete with the low-cost labor in other countries, like China. By automating activities that once required huge amounts of human labor, they’re able to make those activities cheaper. We see this concretely in the American toy company Wham-O, which, after taking steps to further automate its production, decided to move 50 percent of its manufacturing from China back to the US. Another American company, the ATM producer NCR, is likewise relocating its production from China to Georgia, thanks to automation. In both cases, automation allows the companies to achieve faster market delivery and lower shipping costs. What’s more, by producing closer to their customer base, they are able to be much more flexible, and can more easily react to customer complaints or suggestions. That means they can deliver new products and services faster than before. Another reason for the shift away from offshoring is that increasing skills and pressure from labor groups have increased salaries in developing countries along with the costs of labor. In China, for instance, the salaries for industry workers rose rapidly – by 17 percent annually in Guangdong and 50 percent in Shenzhen from 2007 to 2012. According to the Boston Consulting Group, the net costs of manufacturing in China will equal that of the US in 2015. Furthermore, global supply chains and offshoring are risky in today’s volatile world. Political uncertainties – like pirates in Somalia and strikes among factory workers in China – and environmental uncertainties, such as the eruption of an Icelandic volcano in 2010, can lead to huge delays in delivery and even lost shipments. Increases in oil prices and the fluctuation of currency also play a part. Imagine if the Yuan appreciates against the dollar: suddenly, labor costs and shipping from China would be more expensive – enough to cut into profits and force companies to totally reconsider manufacturing practices. So what will happen to the giant manufacturers? Will the Maker Movement kill them off? Not exactly. Just as AT&T didn’t vanish with the rise of the web, 3D printing probably won’t destroy large manufacturers such as General Mills. Those companies will, however, lose their monopoly as manufacturers, and will have to compete with small enterprises that make things for niche markets.   What has happened in the digital world is now happening in the real world: Manufacturing is becoming increasingly decentralized thanks to lower barriers to entry and new technology. In the digital world, publishing became democratized with the help of tools such as Wordpress and Tumblr. Using these services, anybody can publish their thoughts. Broadcasting too was pushed toward democratization. Just think of how many people today own a digital camera and can upload videos and distribute them on YouTube. They can even create their own channels! In the real world, everyone will be able to produce real goods in their home or with the help of specialized factories using 3D printers and other digital manufacturing techniques. This increasingly decentralized ownership of the means of production leads to greater access to production technology and less reliance on manufacturing giants. Now, small businesses and even private individuals have access too. Take Local Motors, for example, an American car manufacturer that produces a small number of cars, 2,000 in fact, using 3D printing and other digital manufacturing methods. Thanks to the digitalization and democratization of manufacturing, custom-made products become cheaper to produce and run in small batches. Instead of one-size-fits-all production, 3D printing manufacturers can offer one-size-fits-one solutions. As anyone can design and modify objects in digital files that can be shared, producers no longer need to manufacture items en masse to make a profit. No matter what you need, from tools to dollhouse furniture, Makers will be able to create custom designs based on your specifications, and you might never again have to rely on a major manufacturer. The key message in this book: Manufacturing is becoming democratized with the introduction of new design and production technologies. Increasingly, people have greater control over what goods are produced, and this will have major consequences both for the organization of industry as well as the products and services available to the consumer.  Suggested further reading: The Zero Marginal Cost Society by Jeremy Rifkin The Zero Marginal Cost Society (2014) lays out a strong case for the self-destructive nature of capitalism, demonstrating how it is sowing the seeds of its own destruction.

Back then, Yahoo was the Internet. But those days are gone: if Yahoo vanished off the face of the earth right now, it would hardly change your internet experience. For almost all of Yahoo’s services, there’s a better alternative out there. In 2012, someone set out to rescue Yahoo – an ambitious character, used to achieving her goals. At just 37, Marissa Mayer was already looking back at an impressive career at Google Inc., leaving the company while at the post of vice president.  While she’s rumoured to be shy, Mayer’s controversial quotes and daring decisions – like buying the microblogging platform Tumblr for the record sum of $1.1 billion – frequently make headlines. Taking the helm as Yahoo’s CEO, Mayer made some terrible choices about the company’s media business, but simultaneously gave Yahoo some much-needed direction, streamlining the product palette and betting heavily on mobile apps. But did it work? The jury is still out. In these blinks, you’ll learn about Yahoo’s very modest beginnings at Stanford University; about the company’s most foolish decision (so far); and about the meteoric rise of Marissa Mayer. Like many other success stories, Yahoo came from modest beginnings. In 1993, Yahoo’s prospective founders David Filo and Jerry Yang shared the links to their favorite web pages on a website called David and Jerry’s Guide to the Internet.  Back then, the world wide web was relatively new and their site was little more than an index of web pages, allowing people who were new to the internet to look up pages they were interested in. Unexpectedly, traffic grew to 50,000 visits per day. It seemed that David and Jerry’s site had tapped into something unique.  The founders renamed the site to the more memorable Yahoo!, an acronym for “Yet another hierarchical officious Oracle”. They also liked the slang definition of the word “yahoo,” referring to a rude, unsophisticated person. And so Yahoo was born. Traffic kept growing steadily, reaching one million clicks per day in 1995. At this rate, the infrastructure provided by Stanford University wasn’t enough to support the site. David and Jerry needed real servers for Yahoo – and for these, they would also need some cash.  Fortunately for them, finding investors was a piece of cake. Sequoia Capital partner Mike Moritz decided that the newbie company needed “adult supervision” to scale up the business. This gave the founders the freedom to focus on the innovation side. Sequoia would become COO, while Stanford graduate Tim Koogle would take on the role of CEO and chairman.  In March 1995, only days after Yahoo was incorporated, they declined an offer of $2 million from America Online to buy Yahoo outright, and instead sold 25 percent of the company to Sequoia Capital for $1 million. With adult supervision in place, it was time for Yahoo to create a serious business plan. Yahoo had its investor and infrastructure – now it just needed to make some money. So, the company’s leaders decided to turn to advertising to generate revenue. Back in 1995, online advertising was still finding its feet. The estimated volume of the entire online advertising market that year was only $20 million.  Yahoo made its first deal with renowned international news agency Reuters, offering to publish their stories on Yahoo.com. Yahoo then signed a deal with Visa and General Motors to post ads, charging as little as $20,000 per month. Business picked up speed soon after. By 1997, Yahoo’s revenue surpassed $70 million and reached $200 million the subsequent year. Traffic at Yahoo.com went from six million clicks per day in 1996 to 167 million in 1998. Meanwhile, the number of employees had also increased from 200 in 1996 to nearly 2,000 in 1999.  This incredible growth is also apparent when looking at how the company’s value changed over the course of its first few years.  After Yahoo held its initial public offering on April 12, 1996, the company had a market capitalization of $848 million. This meant that the remaining share that Jerry Yang and David Filo owned was worth $130 million each.  In 1999, Yahoo had a market value of $23 billion, which made Filo and Yang internet billionaires just four years after they had started swapping lists of web sites with each other.  Ultimately, it was the exponential growth of the internet and its users that made Yahoo a billion-dollar company. The basic idea behind Yahoo’s business model – to create online traffic and sell ads – hadn’t changed. But as it turns out, only 20 percent of the traffic was generated as a result of the site’s initial feature, Yahoo’s directory. The remaining 80 percent of traffic was directed at entirely new products developed by Yahoo. How did they develop these products? Find out in the next blink. Yahoo’s COO Jeff Mallett came from the world of computer software, where you essentially build products and hope users like them. But he realized that Yahoo had the potential for a much more auspicious approach. Yahoo began to use traffic data to match products to customers’ needs. Mallett realized that with the data about customers’ preferences gleaned from web searches, he could simply analyze their clicks and search behavior on Yahoo to build exactly the products that these customers wanted. He wouldn’t have to guess what people needed, because he would already know. This was the beginning of Yahoo’s general strategy: keep an eye on the server logs and develop products quickly that cater to the new internet user. A project-based organizational structure helped Yahoo develop hundreds of new products to generate traffic. But how could Mallett foster the creativity needed to develop all these products? He knew that a conservative organizational structure just wouldn’t cut it for the level of innovation he was aiming for. So he decided to hire as many people as possible and group them into product teams known as “pods” or “virtual sevens.” Mallet would take someone from Yahoo Finance, for example, and tell her to find six other people across the organization to build an entirely new product. They were free to collaborate with anyone inside the organization regardless of distance or department.  By 2000, Yahoo offered more than 400 new products, including chat rooms, games, sports, real estate, a calendar and much more. There were hundreds of pods and ad hoc virtual sevens, and just a few classic core corporate functions such as HR and legal. Things seemed to be going brilliantly.  But soon, Yahoo’s hunger for growth would prove problematic. By late-2000, things at Yahoo began to fall apart. The dot-com crash had hit Yahoo hard, and in that year, the company’s value had shrunk by 90 percent from $128 billion to $12.6 billion. Where did it all go wrong? Put simply, Yahoo sold out.  Since Yahoo was such a popular and big company, every time a new start-up officially announced its collaboration with Yahoo, the start-up’s market value would skyrocket. Some Yahoo executives used this tendency to make deals with start-ups.  Start-ups would pay Yahoo to become their premier bookseller, online travel agency or other main service provider. Then the start-up would announce this deal publicly and people would race to invest in it, simply because it was backed by Yahoo and the company was thus expected to succeed. In 1999, a start-up called Drugstore.com was paying Yahoo $25 million for a major advertising partnership and to become its premier online pharmacy partner. Although the company had only $38 million in the bank and had an annual loss of nearly $20 million, everyone invested and bought its shares. At the end of its IPO, Drugstore.com had a market value of $2.1 billion.  Companies that made an advertising deal with Yahoo were top-ranked in the search results as recommendations. These deals, and not the products’ quality, were the basis of the listing, and Yahoo offered prime advertisement partnerships to unstable, underperforming dot-com companies.  After a while, people became aware of this and stopped clicking on Yahoo’s ads and top-ranked items. As a result, advertising became a lot less lucrative for Yahoo; consumers simply didn’t trust them anymore.  In Yahoo’s early years, about five percent of users would click on the advertisements Yahoo would show them. By 2000, clicks were down to 0.5 percent and falling. The times when Yahoo could charge exorbitant prices for ads because of their success rate were over. So how did the company react? Yahoo had destroyed the integrity and profitability of their online advertising business, and it was time for its first CEO Ted Koogle to resign. His spot was filled by Terry Semel, former CEO of Warner Brothers.  The new CEO reorganized Yahoo’s ad business to make it a traditional ad sales business. Semel’s strategy was simple: although much of Yahoo’s market value was destroyed with the implosion of the dot-com bubble, more and more web users were visiting the site each day.  Semel used this attention to build a traditional advertising business that didn't rely on questionable dot-com companies, and hired Greg Coleman, a seasoned sales manager. In turn, Coleman took care to hire salespeople who actually knew buyers in the companies they were trying to sell ads to, a link that Yahoo didn't have in place before.  Coleman also hired sales representatives who knew how to sell ads over the phone and not just by email, which was the standard practice at Yahoo back then. Consequently, Yahoo started selling many ads to traditional companies.  Coleman liked to use a fishing analogy to describe the changes he made at Yahoo. He said that during its first years, Yahoo was a fishing boat that didn't need to fish because the fish would willingly jump into the boat by themselves. Although it wasn't the case anymore, there were still plenty of fish in the water – Yahoo just had to learn how to actively catch them. But did Coleman’s fishing approach do the trick? Well, in the first year after Semel got the job as CEO, Yahoo still had an annual loss of $98 million. But by 2005, Yahoo had profits totaling $1.2 billion. The company’s market capitalization went from $12.6 billion to $50 billion in the following year.  All in all, building a conservative advertisement sales business had been good for Yahoo. Unfortunately, there were more problems ahead, and bigger fish to fry. Yahoo wasn’t doing too badly after its change of CEO. But in 1997, the company missed an opportunity that would have secured its dominant role in the internet for decades to come. Larry Page offered Yahoo his thesis project BackRub, which would later become Google, for a meagre $1 million. He wanted the money to finance his PhD and become a professor. But Yahoo passed up on the offer! Why? Although Yahoo conceded that the future of online searching lay with algorithms, the company didn’t plan to have its own search engine. Instead, Yahoo wanted to continue buying search functionality services from other companies, giving them the freedom to change their search engine provider whenever necessary.  Obviously, Yahoo would come to regret its decision. Soon thereafter, google.com began to grow incredibly fast, with its search engine becoming far more popular than any other. Google had started to steal traffic from Yahoo. The reason web users preferred Google was its improved approach to organizing search results and managing advertising. As we found out in the previous blinks, Yahoo chose to place the highest-paying advertisers at the top of their search page.  Google’s system was more sophisticated, but also produced more valuable results for users. According to Google’s reasoning, an ad that only pays $0.55 per click, but gets clicked twice as often as a $1.00 ad, is more profitable (and more relevant for the user) and should thus be higher up on the results page.  When Google turned out to be so successful and profitable, Yahoo tried in vain to buy it, again and again, offering up to $6 billion in 2002. It’s now clear that Yahoo well and truly missed the boat. The growing influence of competitors like Google started to chip away at Yahoo’s traffic. Competing with too many specialized start-ups wasn’t helpful for Yahoo’s public and internal image; the company had spread itself too thin.  Yahoo tried to compete with CNN in news, with ESPN in sports, with MySpace in social networking and of course with Google in online searches. When Semel joined Yahoo, it had 400 different products and services. Of course, in every sector, Yahoo paled in comparison to well-funded start-ups that did just one thing very well. The reality was that no one knew what Yahoo was trying to be. On a retreat, one manager asked his fellow managers to write down the first thing that came to their minds when he named a company. So, when he said “PayPal,” they wrote “payments;” when he said “Google,” they wrote “search;” but when he said “Yahoo,” everybody wrote down something different.  Another challenge facing Yahoo was a lack of internal organization. There were too many people with similar projects and overlapping responsibilities, which is a recipe for inefficiency.  If a team’s project is just one among many similar ones, they won’t be as committed as when a project is “their baby.” Moreover, if too many people are responsible for the same tasks, no single person can be held accountable for mistakes. Yahoo’s board knew they needed someone new who understood the tech business better than the current CEO and who could give Yahoo the vision and purpose it obviously lacked. Their choice was Marissa Mayer. Marissa Ann Mayer was born in 1975 in Wisconsin, where a middle-class upbringing allowed her to shine at various hobbies. The ambitious and talented Marissa played volleyball and basketball, took piano lessons and at one point even took ballet for as many as 35 hours a week during middle school.  Quiet, intelligent and with little in the way of social skills, she fit the mold of a nerd perfectly. But for all her nerdiness, it soon became clear that Marissa was quite good at giving directions. Whether in sports or class projects, she always took over a leadership role and was supported by her peers, who felt she was fair and exceptionally good at managing progress. Marissa went on to study at Stanford University, undertaking the prestigious “symbolic systems” major. This blend of linguistics, philosophy, computer science and cognitive psychology also counts Instagram cofounder Mike Krieger and LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman among its alumni. Mayer graduated among the top students in her class. Right after graduating, she accepted a job offer from Google, where her tech-savvy approach and perfectionism were put to good use. She soon discovered her talent for designing flawless user experiences by optimizing the user interface (UI) of Google’s products.   Very quickly, she climbed the corporate ladder and became the leading figure in charge of UI for all of Google’s products, especially search.  Marissa’s keen eye for detail and data became notorious at Google. In one meeting, she talked for hours about multiple shades of blue and their impact on user experience. She always demanded that decisions be made on the basis of user data.  With a brilliant mind and considerable experience, Mayer had the potential to become Yahoo’s saving grace.  As we found out earlier, Yahoo could do everything, but nothing especially well. It was this aspect of the company that Mayer was determined to change.  When Mayer became Yahoo’s CEO, the company faced an important decision: what was it going to become? Would it be a media company that focused on large-scale online publishing, or the production of content such as videos and news? Or would Yahoo be better off as a tech company, centered on developing innovative new products?  At this crossroads, Mayer chose the latter. Knowing that Yahoo’s original success was borne out of making the early internet user friendly, she believed they could do the same for the mobile internet. So, to turn Yahoo into a tech company, Mayer’s first step was to scale up the mobile app team. She resolved to personally ensure that Yahoo’s mobile products would excel.  Her market research was extensive, and yielded a list of the top-priority daily habits of mobile users, including news reading, checking weather, checking mail and photo-sharing. Mayer was determined to develop the best app for each at Yahoo. But one of Mayer’s top priorities in her first months was the development of Yahoo Mail, especially its mobile version. Mayer impressed the app team with her technical knowledge. After all, improving user experience by smoothing the user interface design was her main area of expertise from her time at Google, as well as her personal favorite part of the product to work on.  Soon after Mayer had joined Yahoo, new versions of Yahoo Mail, Flickr and Yahoo’s homepage were launched. Morale was high and people were impressed with the speed of the development process, but it wasn’t enough. On December 2012, Yahoo’s stock was up 24 percent since Mayer became CEO. Only a few months earlier, she had outbid Facebook to buy Tumblr for $1.1 billion and morale was at an all-time high. More and more highly qualified candidates began sending their résumés to Yahoo.  It looked like Yahoo was finally out of the woods. But it was actually far from it! Despite all its efforts, Yahoo’s search market share was still shrinking, as was its traffic and, ultimately, its revenues from selling ads. As it turned out, Yahoo’s rising stock value was mostly a result of the fact that it owned parts of Alibaba, an exploding Asian start-up. Meanwhile, there was a major aspect of the Yahoo business that was being neglected: media. Yahoo’s media business had three thousand employees and revenues of $1.5 billion. It was a big and stable contributor to Yahoo’s $5 billion total revenues, and would have to play a big part in Yahoo’s future. After Mayer realized the importance of this part of business, she began to dive into it. But as it turned out, she wasn’t made for the media business. While her decision making regarding tech products was always based on evidence, Mayer went with her gut when it came to media. Unfortunately, her choices were often miles off the mark when it came to the preferences of Yahoo users. She would turn down programs that were huge commercial successes, simply because she didn’t like them. When actress Gwyneth Paltrow, who had a best-selling cookbook at that time, was about to be hired as a contributing editor for Yahoo Food, Mayer blocked the hire because “she didn’t even go to college.” It took Mayer a while to accept that she wasn’t made for this side of the business. When she finally did, media was placed in more capable hands at Yahoo, and Mayer returned to the tech side of things. But Yahoo’s business was still struggling all the while. Mayer and her development teams increased their efforts even more and began to push themselves to the limit. Mayer’s efforts to increase the speed of processes caused problems within Yahoo and among its users.  The new Yahoo Mail was suffering multiple breakdowns, and users couldn’t access their mail. The reason was that the development team was pushed so hard to produce results quickly, they couldn’t properly test the underlying technology before launching.  Slowly but surely, Mayer’s ambitions began to grate on many of the company’s employees. Some of her decisions and personal behavior saw many talented people leave Yahoo altogether. According to Yahoo’s employees, one of the biggest problems was Mayer’s employee rating system.  Because Mayer wanted to dismiss low performers and cut costs, managers had to grade their employees’ performance on a fixed curve. Even on top-performing teams, someone always had to get a poor score.  This caused much frustration and eventually encouraged hostility rather than collaboration among employees, since everyone was competing with each other.  But Mayer still didn’t give up. She engaged more actively in the development of apps, replaced some of her executives and gave motivational speeches in front of employees – but the numbers weren’t improving.  Revenues still shrunk because Yahoo’s media content couldn’t attract more customers. The apps, though very well designed, just couldn’t generate enough traffic. Why weren’t things working? Well, Yahoo’s biggest asset was that it had made the internet easy to use for normal people back in the internet’s early days. But Google, Facebook and others were doing that now, too.  When Yahoo tried to do the same for mobile internet, Apple’s iPhone and Google’s Android had already solved that problem for everyone.  The company hasn’t found its true purpose since. If Yahoo can target and solve one big problem that technology users face today, then they might have a shot at future success. In the meantime, the struggle to rescue Yahoo continues. The key message in this book: After explosive success in its early stages, Yahoo is today struggling against its competitors and with the challenge of finding its true purpose. Marissa Mayer, the company’s latest CEO, has given Yahoo some hope, but has yet to create a roadmap for the company to regain relevance in the present and for the future.

In short, crises and scandals hit everyday. The constant nature of these scandals and their severity could deter you from striving for power and influence; some would instead wish for a quiet life, devoid of the risks of fame, yet also of the excitement of it. But don’t let that fear deter you. These blinks will show you how to be resilient to crisis, based on the experiences of some of the top disaster managers in the world. In these blinks you will learn why Rupert Murdoch’s staff turned against him; why the German football manager sent himself for a drug’s test; and why no one manages a crisis better than Hillary Clinton. When you hear the word crisis, what springs to mind? A plane crash? A bank collapse? Yet a crisis could be less overt, but equally troublesome: an organization’s security protocol could be breached or a high profile figure could be misquoted on an important issue. If we think about crises this way, we can see that they happen every single day. Today, several social and technological developments have unfortunately made crises the “normal state of nature.” In our information age, virtually everyone with a smartphone can break news. Every stray comment and  poor decision can immediately be shared across the world at lightning speed. Say a risque joke at the office party and within minutes it’s viral across the company. A businessman criticizes his staff to a journalist, and in no time at all, it’s plastered all over the news feeds of his employees, shareholders and customers. In this way, the news we receive and share via social media tends to be selective and biased. Simply through the sheer wealth of different sources of information online (social media, news sites, blogs etc.), it is increasingly easy to find news to fit your existing beliefs. So, major crises can be created by people who naively think what they’ve heard is true and spread the false information online. Remember those claims that President Obama was not born in the USA? They were widely proliferated by Republicans and led to crisis-fed journalism, even though they were complete nonsense. Once misinformation goes public, it’s hard to restore one’s reputation. But it’s been done. In the next blinks, you’ll learn how. While crises have become increasingly frequent and publicized, we still aren’t that good at combating them. When a crisis breaks out, the first mistake we often make is responding too hastily and releasing inaccurate information. For example, in 2011, Congressman Anthony Weiner was accused of “sexting” six women, though he was married. As soon as the crisis broke, Weiner rushed to respond, first denying the accusation, then claiming his Facebook account was hacked. In the end he was proven guilty and was forced to resign. If had responded calmly and released accurate information, he may have been able to ride out the situation. The second mistake we make in a crisis is concealing problematic details or spinning things in our favor: whatever you try to hide will get exposed sooner or later. For example, after the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil drilling platform, BP launched a huge PR campaign promoting overly optimistic outcomes to the damage caused by the oil. Yet, when the actual damage became apparent, the company looked like it had tried to hide (or even worse, make light of) its mistakes. Finally, there’s one more major “don’t” in a crisis: blame shifting. By trying to make the crisis appear as someone else’s fault, that someone else will attack you back. Rupert Murdoch learned this lesson the hard way. When the News of the World tabloid, owned by Murdoch, was accused of hacking cell phones, Murdoch blamed a number of the paper’s executives. It’s unsurprising then that these executives provided strong testimony against Murdoch in return. By trying to lay the blame on others, Murdoch only made things worse for himself. Now we’ve seen all the things we shouldn’t but often do when facing a crisis. So what can we do? As it turns out, we aren’t totally helpless. Get ahead of the game to manage a crisis: if you are prepared for the worst, you can improve outcomes even after a major blow to your reputation. Think about potential crises and develop strategies to combat them: with which audience do you need to repair trust? For example, a professional sports franchise should be prepared to respond to a fight in which a rival fan is badly injured. Or, a non-profit organization should be prepared to reassure donors following accusations of embezzlement. Having an emergency strategy will also help you keep cool when a crisis breaks. It will allow you to face the situation with care and attention. In 1996, First Lady Hillary Clinton demonstrated an emergency strategy when important but apparently “lost” financial documents surfaced. Rather than panic, the Clinton team made a planned and measured response, making the records public and explaining the situation as best they could. The crisis soon dissipated, with little to no damage to the Clinton reputation; in fact, her husband was re-elected the same year. Here’s something Hillary Clinton would also know: damage control is a marathon, not a sprint. Even if you don’t manage to avert a crisis immediately, always think in the long term. If you want to restore your reputation and trustworthiness, you’ve got a long road ahead – so keep on going.  For example, Michael Milken, an unscrupulous Wall Street trader, was sentenced to 10 years in prison for insider trading. But due to good behavior, he was released after only two years and began to direct his financial potency toward cancer research. Soon, he was featured on the cover of Fortune as “The man who changed medicine.” He’s a prime example of long-term reputation recovery! How can you restore people’s trust in you after a crisis jeopardizes it? Do you provide people full disclosure? What if the truth is embarrassing or confusing? No matter what, you must remain completely honest and accurate. In 1992 nine people died from Tylenol pills that had been laced with cyanide. The producer of Tylenol, Johnson & Johnson, told the public immediately what little they knew about the situation, and admitted that they couldn’t answer many important questions. Sure, the incident and the gaps in their knowledge made the company look incompetent. But, they demonstrated an honest approach to addressing the problem and managed to mitigate damage to their brand reputation. After you’ve owned up to a crisis, you must provide a plan to fix the problem. Showing that you are in control and willing to make changes allows the public to see you’re serious. But, you must offer a plan you can deliver. Johnson & Johnson demonstrated good damage control when they outlined an achievable plan that promised to prevent the Tylenol deaths from ever happening again. They informed the public that pills already on the shelves would be destroyed, and new batches would have a secure lid that would show evidence of tampering. In doing so, Johnson & Johnson rode out the catastrophic crisis, and they have continued to be a market leader. Say you’ve made an honest statement about your crisis and presented your solution to the public. If you want to keep the situation under control, there are two things you’ve got to do.   First, stick to the bottom line: a statement you can maintain with certainty over the crisis’ whole course. For example, Maple Leaf Foods, which was found to have released life-threatening bacteria-contaminated products into the market in 2008, responded, “Our actions are guided by putting public health first.” It was a bottom line they could commit to as they rode their crisis out. On the flip side, a careless bottom line will worsen the situation. For example, German football coach Christoph Daum was accused of using cocaine in 2001. He announced he would take a drug test to prove his innocence; the drug test was positive, forcing Daum to admit use and resign. He later said that taking the test had been “a mistake.” In Daum’s case, the better choice would have been to commit to cooperation. Most crises are reviewed by an official body. If you want to stand the best chance of a good working relationship with them, you have to let them know you are ready to cooperate fully. Commitment to cooperation demonstrates that you want to get to the bottom of the issue without covering anything up. In Hillary Clinton’s case, for example, she minimized damage by passing the documents to investigators immediately and telling them all she knew. The investigators, in return, were able to let the crisis smoothly pass over. When a crisis happens, there is one place you simply don’t want to be: the spotlight. How can you shift the focus of a scandal away from yourself? First, let the issue become bigger than you. There may be others involved who are likely to play a greater role in the crisis. A whole system might even be brought into question, while you’re perceived as just a tiny part of a systematic breakdown. If you can see that the blame will likely be focused onto other broader factors or issues, then simply keep calm and quiet, and let the scandal drift to someone or something else. If you don’t, you’ll only prolong the chaos. For example, in the huge MLB doping scandal many players were accused of doping, including one of the most successful players of all time, Barry Bonds. Roger Clemens, one of the accused, was close to retirement. He could have just kept quiet and let the media focus on Barry Bonds and MLB baseball. Instead he fired back at the accusers and released various statements of innocence which kept him in the spotlight for months! What Roger Clemens didn’t realize was that if you don’t make the news again, you and your part in the scandal will quickly be forgotten. The overwhelming speed of spreading information and masses of content that we are bombarded with increases the likelihood of getting caught up in a crisis, but it also gives us a chance of getting out of it just as quickly. Sometimes, though, having a passive approach isn’t enough. What if you come under fire due to accusations that just aren’t true? Simply sticking your head in the ground like an ostrich and waiting for the storm to pass by might not be enough. Instead, you should expose those who brought the crisis into being and shine a light on their self-interested motives. In a crisis there are always the subjects of the crisis and those who benefit from it. For example, in the 2004 US presidential election Senator Kerry made his military career in Vietnam as a commander of a Navy Swift boat a core aspect of his campaign. Shortly before the elections an allegedly independent group of Vietnam veterans calling themselves “Swift Boat Veterans for Truth” published several ads and a best-selling book questioning Kerry’s honesty and integrity. Superficial background checks would have revealed that the supposedly independent group had strong ties to many active Republicans. However, the Kerry campaign failed to react in time. This only won John Kerry an entry in the dictionary of the word “swift-boat” (meaning to launch a smearing campaign), but might have cost him the presidency. Kerry should have defended himself and attacked their position. His failure to expose them cost him dearly. If you want to expose those who swift-boat you, you’ll need to research thoroughly, connect the dots and find out who is behind your crisis. In most crises there is some party who gains from your scandal. When you find a provable misrepresentation, seize it and condemn the opposition. This will shift the attention toward the low credibility of your opponent and lead your audience to question other claims they’ve made as well. So, whether it’s a slip-up of your own or a calculated attack by an opponent, these blinks have prepared you for any kind of crisis that comes your way. The key message in this book: Crises are increasingly common in modern society, yet that doesn’t mean that we should let them rule our lives. If you learn the secrets of damage control, you can maintain people’s trust in you, no matter what you’re faced with. Actionable advice: Admit your mistakes! Making a mistake when you are under pressure is a common thing. If this happens to you, don’t despair! Simply admit the mistake as soon as possible and your humility may earn you support. Fact: The Wall Street Journal analyzed several YouTube apologies from CEOs battling crises. They concluded that the sooner the person apologized, the more effective their recovery.

But as any successful consultant knows, solo consulting isn’t just about amassing a large fortune. In fact, success in consulting involves surmounting a dramatic learning curve and collecting broad and diverse experiences and skills. It brings the possibility to make changes that can potentially impact the lives of tens of thousands of people. These blinks will teach you how to set up your own company and acquire the kinds of clients that will make your million-dollar business. They’ll also give you tips – some of which are quite counterintuitive – for success in this industry. In these blinks, you will also learn: why successful consultants actually fire their clients, why putting relationships before money will actually make you wealthier, how to ask for $50,000, why you should never ever enter negotiations with the “gatekeeper,” and why your free time is your true wealth. What does it take to become a doctor or a lawyer? That’s easy: there is a strict set of requirements you need to fulfill, like passing the bar or doing your residency, after which you’re awarded a certificate that allows you to practice. While the requirements for becoming a doctor or lawyer, like those for many other professions, are quite narrow, virtually anyone can call themselves a consultant. If that’s the case, then what does the word actually mean? A consultant is someone who has a unique set of skills and talents that help to create the value-adding components that their clients’ businesses lack. The value that they add comes from two sources: content expertise and process expertise. Content expertise is earned through study and work in a specialized field, where the wealth of your experience and professional relationships lie. In other words, this is your professional “comfort zone,” where you are the most competent. This expertise is rooted in the specific skills and talents that made you successful in one particular industry or field of study in the first place. If you are consulting for a specialized firm – for example, as an expert witness in a legal dispute – then you are acting as a content consultant. This contrasts with process expertise, which transcends specific industries, is applicable in almost any environment, and involves a set of highly effective methods. For example, the company Bain & Co. has spent years conducting strategic planning projects, and thus has developed the experience and the methodology necessary to consider themselves as having expertise in strategic processes. Consequently, they tend to specialize in just that area, as they know it best. For solo consultants especially, process expertise is often more valuable than content consulting. This is because process expertise has a wider range of applications across a broad spectrum of diverse industries, which can help to make up for a lack of content expertise. Starting a business isn’t easy, and often the biggest hurdle is attracting the attention of potential clients to your services. So how do you do it? There are two major ways in which organizations find consultants: word of mouth and an outstanding body of work. Word-of-mouth marketing is by far the simplest and most effective of these two methods, as it leads the clients directly to you. Unfortunately, since word-of-mouth marketing is based on direct recommendations by clients or someone else who has at least heard about your services, the process is therefore almost completely out of your hands. In spite of this, it can be wildly successful. In fact, the author has traced many of his most valuable projects back to recommendations by clients or other completely unexpected sources. It is therefore important that, apart from delivering first-class work, you treat every single interaction with a prospective client as a personal “moment of truth,” and always think in long-term relationships. In the end, consulting is a “relationship business,” and your success depends upon the relationships you build. Of course, you can also help this process along by asking your satisfied clients for testimonials and recommendations directly. Word-of-mouth marketing must be backed up by actual value, so it’s important to keep a record of your success as well as your intellectual property in order to build your reputation and showcase your body of work. Everything you’ve done – from hard-copy publishing, speaking, interviews and product sales, to websites and newsletters – enhances your visibility. Start producing intellectual property early in order to develop your body of work, and use this as references to your credibility rather than as mere sales vehicles. The best way to get people to see the value you can add to their business is by showing them the value you’ve added to others’. How do you measure the quality of your work? Many consultants get tangled up in quantifying their tasks with arbitrary measurements, like the number of meetings held or reports written. In reality, the quality of your work comes down to one thing and one thing only: the value you add to your client’s business. In this way, consulting is about results, not tasks. If you just fulfill tasks and define deliverables without connecting them to a specific value-adding result, you’re just creating a heavy and unproductive workload for yourself, such as writing reports and sitting through meetings devoid of goals. To avoid this, you should enter an agreement with your client in which “the ‘how’ is subordinated to the ‘what.’” In other words, a fulfilling and positive consultant–client relationship is one in which the end result, rather than the method, is what’s important. However, in order to forge this kind of positive relationship, you will have to clarify to your clients that your work should be measured in terms of the value you add, rather than, for example, the time it takes to complete the project. To do this successfully, you will need to come to an agreement on what the objectives are and how they will be measured before you even write a proposal. This requires collaboration, and, unsurprisingly, the best consultants collaborate with their clients. This is because the kinds of value a consultant adds – roughly divided into resolving an issue or transferring skills – can change depending on the specific needs of the client. Whereas an interventionist imbues an organization with highly effective skills, and an independent expert resolves many important issues critical to a company’s success, only a collaborator is able to do both at the same time. By demonstrating their flexibility, collaborators not only offer the most value to their clients’ organizations but also tend to have the strongest and longest-lasting relationships with the client, and thus the follow-up projects and referrals that come with them. What is it that defines your consulting business and sets it apart from the crowd? Every consulting firm has some unique motivational force behind it that sets out their strategic goals and paves the path for their business. Unfortunately, companies too often formulate mission statements such as, “We want to help clients to achieve the best results possible,” or “We want to be on the cutting edge of our field.” The problem is that these statements are far too vague and generic. Good mission statements get specific in their goals and their intended results. For example, if you want to improve customer service, you might have a strategy like this: “We will design and implement workshops that use customer feedback to create demonstrable changes in behavior on the job.” Or, if you specialize in process optimization, you might “assist clients in enhancing staff productivity through needs analysis, enhanced communication and joint decision making.” No matter how you formulate your strategy, the key is to show how value is added, and thus differentiate your service from others. This strategic goal will always be underpinned by this primary motivator: to grow, both financially and personally. There is virtually no other profession with a steeper learning curve than consulting. Consequently, your ability to add value to your clients’ operations increases with every new experience, gained ability and learned skill, all of which, in turn, justify a rise in your fees. At the same time, every assignment will ideally leave you with a new valuable contact or strengthened relationship with your client, thus improving your network and word-of-mouth marketing. This means that you should always get something out of your contracts. If a business doesn’t meet your growth strategy – for example, if the project doesn’t meet your fee structure, is unchallenging or doesn’t otherwise help you grow – don’t do it. Has your doctor ever told you that there’s something you need to cut out of your life – maybe smoking or candy bars – in order to improve your health? Surprisingly, the same is true in the world of consulting: sometimes consultants fail to grow because they refuse to abandon bad clients. This is because consultancy firms operate differently to other businesses, such as soft drink manufacturers, who will always try to sell to as many people as possible. In order to grow – both financially as well as in terms of client relationships and professional experiences – you will need to let go of less lucrative businesses. As your wealth of experience continues to grow, your fees should grow with them. Not only is this good for your wallet, but it’s also good for your reputation. If you become known as an “inexpensive alternative” desperate to accept any job, you will receive the pay and repute that come with such a perception. Instead, ensure that the quality of your work is always above the quantity, i.e., one $50,000 project will always be more valuable to you than ten $5,000 ones. In fact, the time and cost required to sell a $100,000 project or a $10,000 project is generally very similar, thus making bigger projects all the more valuable to you. And since the value you can provide increases with your expertise and your abilities, it only makes sense for you to raise your fees accordingly. Consequently your strategic goals should incorporate the aim to accumulate increasingly higher-value assignments. One good way to ensure that this actually happens is to look back at all of your assignments every two years and identify the bottom 15 percent that you then choose to no longer accept, thus making room for more lucrative business. If you don’t grow continually, your success will eventually erode beneath you. By constantly looking for opportunities to expand your business, you will steadily climb, growing your wealth with each step. A consultant’s most crucial actions are to differentiate their business and find their niche – but how do you achieve this? The answer lies in branding yourself and building relationships. Although we’ve been told not to, people really do judge a book by its cover. Knowing this, you should be sure you create a personal brand that others will both like and recognize. Like it or not, part of this brand is your personal presentation. Have a few nice suits and accessories, and strive to behave like the professional you are. Try to stay natural, avoiding things like hairdryers, potent fragrances and tanning salons. However, it is not your face, but your name, and the logo that accompanies it, that is your ultimate trademark. Thus you should always use your logo on everything you produce. Potential clients need to be able to recognize your work in an instant in order to make it easy for them to call on you. You also want your business to be a legally recognized entity. Generally, if you’re not incorporated, you’re considered an amateur. You’ll never be perceived as a true professional, and will consequently lose out on many lucrative business opportunities. It’s also important to consider how you differentiate yourself: specialization makes you competitive and differentiated services make you distinct, but your relationship with the client will determine whether you are perceived as a valuable collaborator or a one-timer. The ideal relationship is one where the client has confidence in the consultant to make decisions on his own, act responsibly and in the client’s best interest. One simple way to gain trust is to provide your best clients with your private telephone number. The ability to call upon you during tough times provides a feeling of safety and partnership. In addition, you shouldn’t be afraid to take a stand on crucial issues, even when internal politics threaten the success of your project. In the end, good clients will understand that you are acting in their best interests, and will only trust you more. Consultants who don’t “make it” are often unsuccessful because they fail to convince the client of their value. This is because there are a number of hurdles that can make negotiations difficult. Firstly, you will often find yourself sitting across from a gatekeeper at the negotiating table – someone who is authorized to say “no” but not “yes,” like, for example, HR personnel or a mid-level manager. Under no circumstance should you ever enter negotiations with a gatekeeper and you should always insist on the presence of the person who actually makes the ultimate decisions and writes the checks. Secondly, you will have to overcome the four main reasons clients use to reject your services: no money, no urgency, no need, and no trust. No money or urgency: The key to overcoming this hurdle is to focus solely on value in your negotiations. If you can successfully show how the issues your potential client faces will worsen over time, and explain exactly what kind of value you’ll deliver, then your services will appear more urgently required and your fees more reasonable. No need: Indeed, “the essence of marketing is to create need.” Generally speaking, clients know exactly what they want, but not always what they need. To surmount this hurdle, you’ll need to identify what their needs are, show them why they need these things, and then explain the value you can add by helping them meet their needs. No trust: If you and the client have no relationship, then there is no trust upon which successful negotiations can rest. To develop this relationship, you have to identify the issues that excite or frustrate your client and provide candid feedback, positioning yourself “as potential partner, not as a salesperson or a sycophant,” and convincing them that you have their best interests in mind. If you can succeed in surmounting these obstacles, then they’ll have no choice but to say “yes.” It can sometimes be difficult to translate the services you provide into a dollar amount. Many consultants make the mistake of charging a per diem fee, but unfortunately for them, this is not only counterproductive, but can even be considered unethical. This is because the time you spend on a project has no intrinsic value for the customer in and of itself. The only thing that the client is interested in is improvement, or value. If, however, your fees are based on the time spent on a project, then your goal is actually to maximize time rather than add value. Such a pay scale puts you and your client in opposition to one another: the client wants fast and profound improvement, and you want longer project times. In reality, however, value-based fees and shorter project times are far more appropriate for meeting your client’s need for fast results and your need for personal, professional, and financial growth. The same applies for tasks. Clients don’t care about the tasks – they care about results. Furthermore, since tasks are repetitive, they therefore lose value the more with each repetition due to economies of scale. Outcomes, however, only become more valuable as they accumulate. So how should you structure your fees? Here are some things you’ll want to consider: What qualitative and quantitative benefits will you provide your client? How will affect your client’s reputation? How much emotional energy will you need to invest in the project? You should also consider the scope of the project, the number of people who will have access to your services, and the approximate duration of the project. Ultimately, the only way to get the fees you deserve is to convince your client of the value you add and then simply ask for them. Many people, however, can’t ask for a huge amount of money convincingly. Make it easier on yourself by practicing saying, “the fee will be $50,000” in front of a mirror in order to convey the confidence that justifies the fee. How far ahead do you plan for your future? If you’re like most consultants, you don’t look much further than your next paycheck. This tunnel vision is what causes most consultants to miss the omens of bad times ahead. In order to stay above water, you’ll need to closely monitor the volume and source of your incoming assignments. The pipeline approach is one way to gain perspective on your incoming assignments. Your pipeline indicates all of your long-term, short-term, and immediate projects along a timeline, all of which are “signed and sealed,” thus representing safe income. Your pipeline should be filled with short-term sales you’ve closed, repeat business from current clients, and other business that comes by referral. You should also make plenty of time for prospects and direct marketing targets. And because most companies have a policy that does not allow multi-fiscal-year agreements, most pipelines will represent a 12-month period. For you, this means that your pipeline offers a realistic estimate of yearly cash flow and profit. A poorly structured pipeline, however, can lead to a world of problems. For starters, a dry pipeline puts you under pressure to acquire new, short-term business, which almost always translates into poor business, poor fees, and fewer growth opportunities. Additionally, when your projects are unevenly distributed or clumped together at some point in the pipeline, you will probably have to hire contractors or enter an agreement with another consultant in order to complete all the work. This, in turn, reduces your margin and opportunities for growth. You should also take care to monitor your pipeline. If you notice a lack of new prospects and targets as well as a lack of repeat business from your existing clients, it might be that either your marketing efforts are ineffective or that you’ve failed to form strong relationships with your clients. As a result of the economic crisis of 2008, many consultancy firms suffered a loss of business and drastic cutbacks in their expenses. Others, however, were able to actually grow their business in spite of this economic hardship. So what did they do differently? The answer: they invested in their businesses instead of cutting costs, and made use of their highly diversified services and excellent client relationships. You can think of the economy as acting like a hydraulic system: “When something goes down, something else goes up.” Therefore, with the right strategy, you can actually use a crisis to your advantage. Regardless of the economic climate, however, you should diversify your services – both your content and your process expertise – in order to address the industries that thrive in booms and those that thrive in busts. Indeed, some industries – for example, the pet care and health industries – are quite resilient in economic depressions, and you want to be able to capture that business when the time is right. Another way to protect your business is by expanding your market geographically. This strategy will ease the pain of regional economic downturns and keep you from being overwhelmed by local competitors. And if you do fall into slow times, you can focus your time away from clients and become productive in other areas – most importantly marketing. For example, you could make it a habit to call your old clients and partners in order to maintain a good relationship, write articles for a magazine, or give speeches on the challenges of the crisis. Finally, most competitors will start divesting in times of crisis and uncertainty. Clients, however, will immediately notice the falling quality and value of their services. You should do the opposite, and fill the void left behind by your competitors with your enhanced efforts to make your value noticeable to the clients. In order to be the most successful consultant possible, your ultimate goal must be to become irreplaceable for your clients and to form lasting relationships with them in order to maximize your fees and keep your pipeline filled with assignments. To achieve this, you’ll need to think strategically and in the long term, even discounting your fees for special opportunities that allow you to gain enough knowledge about your client’s organization to make yourself an irreplaceable asset. With every project you are involved in, your worth will increase as the added value of your projects accumulates and the organization imparts more insider information to you. Having been educated about the ins and outs of the culture and business of your client’s organization, you can then be more proactive about finding areas where you could add value, suggest projects, and thus raise your fees. In order to gain these valuable insights, start your project with “roaming time” in order to get an overview of how the organization works and is perceived by the different stakeholders and functionaries within the organization. Roaming time never really ends during your project, as there is always more to learn, but in the beginning, you should take special care to meet all key senior staff as well as a wide cross section of middle- and lower-level managers in order to gain insight into their perceptions, and how they use the resources and technology available to them. Additionally, you can accompany salespeople on the road, and even try to talk to the major customers to get their perspective. Once you’ve successfully completed a couple of assignments and have gained sufficient knowledge about your client’s organization, you have reached the ultimate point in your client–consultant relationship. In the words of the author, “you have become a wise person whose contributions are a synthesis of personal talents, organizational knowledge, and personal relationships established with top management.” Hell-bent on being as financially successful as possible, many consultants end up spending their lives in airplane seats and clients’ offices, leaving only the weekend for their families, if that. Others, however, believe that their real wealth is their discretionary time, and that money is merely the means to achieve that lifestyle. If that’s the case for you, then growing your business may actually mean a decrease in your wealth. In fact, it is a holistic outlook on life, rather than one focused on business, that will truly make you a better consultant. This is because you can draw more energy and creativity from a balanced life, which in turn improves your work and helps clients to see you as both a complete human being and a professional. But how do you achieve the balance between work and play that allows for a more balanced and rich life? First of all, you must realize that there is no strict division between your professional and private life. There is only one life: your life. Consequently, you should eliminate arbitrary time boundaries, and instead do things when “the spirit moves you.” If you want to complete some work on Sunday and go to the beach on Monday, that’s fine! As an independent consultant, you are the master of your time, so use it as you wish. Secondly, the secret to a fulfilling life lies in variety. As Nietzsche once wrote, “a day has a hundred pockets if you know what to put in them,” so you should make an earnest effort to never stop learning and to push yourself to try new things. Avoid isolation, find inspiration in others and help them in order to maintain perspective about the priorities in your life. And lastly, stay healthy and fit, and reward yourself regularly. A healthy body is home to a healthy soul, increases your confidence and curiosity, and makes you more resistant to stress. The key message in this book: Consulting is a “relationship business,” where no one cares about your methodology or degree. The only thing that truly matters is the value you add to your client’s balance sheet. As you continue to grow on your journey toward success, keep in mind that it is your free time – not mere money – that is your true wealth. Actionable advice: Always think in terms of value, not in tasks. Your clients are not interested in the number of tasks you must complete to finish a project. They are only interested in one thing: the results. Consequently, it is better for you – and for them – to approach your fee structure from the perspective of the value you add to their organization, rather than the number of hours it will take you to complete the project. Put potential relationships before money. While sealing a $50,000 deal is a great thing indeed, it’s far better for you to develop the kinds of professional relationships that will lead to repeated $50,000 deals. Your success and your fortune are highly dependent upon others’ perceptions of you.

Meanwhile, opportunities are passing by your company and all you can do is grin through your teeth. No more! There’s a better way to deal with meetings and conferences. Let’s call them strategic conversations and recognize them for what they are: opportunities. These strategic conversations are opportunities for your organization to get its greatest minds together and start tackling problems. These blinks show how to take advantage of strategic conversations. That means big picture things like figuring out what the purpose of a meeting should be, as well as details, like making an agenda. This pack will make you a better leader and cause you to shake your head at all the terrible meetings you’ve attended! After reading these blinks, you’ll know when meetings shouldn’t occur in the same old conference room; how to avoid invisible gorillas; and who to invite in order to have the best meeting. What is the most important quality in a leader? Is it her determination? Her creativity? Or maybe it’s her ability to rally her people together behind a common cause. Actually, it’s none of the above. A good leader is defined by her ability to design strategic conversations; that is, helping others channel their creativity and finding great solutions to her company’s obstacles. Among her most useful skills are the ability to plan a meeting and steer conversations. Have you ever sat in a meeting or a two-day conference that promised to improve your skills, only to find yourself brought down by tedium and boredom? While those meetings may have been meticulously planned, they missed one crucial thing: they didn’t pay attention to their audiences and didn’t help them work effectively. As a leader, you want to organize and lead strategic conversations that make everyone’s work as satisfying as possible. It will allow you to guide your employees towards enlightening moments, great problem-solving strategies and newfound creativity. Unfortunately, many leaders – even well established ones – never learned to properly lead a strategic conversation. Despite its usefulness, you won’t find courses that teach strategic conversations in most universities or other educational institutions. For example, the authors recall a time when they received a desperate phone call from a senior executive who was planning a two-day conference. He had noticed about eight days before the actual event that, while he had planned the location and the topic, he had no idea how to successfully steer those meetings to generate potent discussions and the effective solutions. Despite his top-notch education, he felt totally lost, and ended up having the authors fly out to help him prepare. After reading these blinks, you’ll have all the tools you need to design effective strategic conversations – and you won’t have to pay for anyone’s plane tickets. We all know that in order to plan a successful event, we need to get basics right: the venue, the participants, topics and the guests. But what should you be considering beyond those essentials? To answer this question, we’ll have to look at what defines a strategic conversation in the first place: Strategic conversations are all about creating a shared experience for every participant, in which the most pressing issues are explored openly to come to the smartest ways to proceed. It means carefully examining your own assumptions and prejudices, rather than simply accepting them, and creating a space in which different perspectives and opinions are freely shared and accepted as legitimate. Strategic conversations allow you to engage with entire groups on a deep level that most leaders couldn’t dream of. For example, rather than simply boring your staff with figures and forecasts during your quarterly update meeting, you could play on their assumptions about the business in order to create “aha moments.” Strategic conversations only become more important when the topics of these dialogues are ambiguous. For example, if you’re leading a meeting on a nebulous topic such as “How do we increase sales?” then you will need to be both creative and strategic to fight against the mediocrity that so easily arises from ill-defined meetings. To look at this in action, we’ll turn to one of the most successful companies in South America, Natura. They once had a meeting about brand values led by the company’s Vice-President of Organizational Development and Sustainability Marcelo Cardoso. It was largely unsuccessful. Where did Cardoso go wrong? He tried to treat this meeting like any other, despite the grand nature of “brand values” as a topic. By doing things like sticking to a schedule, keeping to the agenda and even using the same location for his meeting, he allowed his coworkers to relax into their default mode: bored, uninterested and uncreative. But how exactly can you devise these strategic conversations? Our following blinks lay out the core principles of leading conversations. Your company is faced with a dilemma: one of your competitors is stealing some of your top employees! What do you do? Your old routine won’t suffice; if it did, your staff wouldn’t be leaving. So, you’ll have to devise new strategies. These challenges, i.e., adaptive challenges, require time to solve. Unlike smaller problems, adaptive challenges like aggressive competitors or a new and unexplored market opportunity will take at least a few months – if not a few years – to adapt to and solve. In these cases, it’s extremely important that you understand the scope of the challenge so that you don’t allow yourself to get caught up in other people’s haste. The last thing you want is to make a snap decision that simply destroys your plan before it even gets off the ground. In the process of solving adaptive challenges, you’ll likely be involved in many conversations that address the many diverse aspects of the problem. Addressing the different aspects can be confusing and it is important to have targeted discussions to address to details, as well as the broad topics. How can you make sure to cover all the important points? One way is to set goals for each meeting to keep them free of distractions. By defining one clear purpose for each meeting or conversation, you define exactly where you want to be at the meeting’s end. If people are allowed to, they’ll lose themselves in the details, so keep them focused. Ask precise questions and be clear about who is responsible for implementing the decisions. Questions like, “Can your team provide five actionable project suggestions by Wednesday?” is much easier to follow up on than, “Can you send me some project ideas?” If people meander off track and start talking about things irrelevant to this meeting’s purpose, you can simply remind them: “Good point, and let’s table that for another meeting. We still need to solve the problem at hand.” At this point, you might think you have what it takes to face adaptive challenges. Unfortunately, however, it’s not all about you. If you want to solve adaptive challenges, you’ll need to surround yourself with the right people and perspectives. This team should be comprised of people from diverse areas of expertise and backgrounds who will help you make the most of your meetings. Strategic conversations are only as good as the people involved, but the people you should involve aren’t always who you might expect. For example, if you’re hosting an annual marketing convention, don’t invite the usual “must-invite” team of ad companies, marketing departments and staff. Try a different route: Think about how your company doesn’t consist of a single department. Rather, it’s made up of a multitude of different people and perspectives that aren’t always aware of one another. Mix things up by inviting people with diverse perspectives and different areas of expertise, and embrace the diversity of your team. Eamonn Kelly, Head of Strategy of Scottish Enterprise, would have benefited from those diverse perspectives when he arranged a meeting between various departments, including entrepreneurship, services and business infrastructure departments. While the departments brought valuable thoughts and perspectives, they lacked the communication necessary to optimize sharing their knowledge. To demonstrate to them the importance of diverse perspectives, Kelly sat the parties down and had them write a list of what they gave to other departments and what they got from them. Unsurprisingly, when he hung the lists next to each other, his staff was surprised to see that each department thought they gave more than they got. This realization actually made the participants want to learn more about including the other teams in their tasks. Have you ever heard of an invisible gorilla? They exist. Seriously! At least, that’s how it feels after watching one social experiment in which participants viewed a video of two basketball teams passing a ball back and forth. The participants were told to focus on the number of passes the white team made while ignoring the black team. In the middle of the video, a woman in a black gorilla costume walked onto the court. You would expect people to react with dismay, yet over half of them didn’t even notice it. Why? Because we sometimes ignore what’s happening right in front of us when we’re focused on something else. Likewise, you don’t want your coworkers to miss the “gorilla in the room” by focusing on irrelevant topics. As the strategic conversation designer, you are responsible for assembling the relevant content for your meeting without overwhelming the attendees. Tell them exactly what they should be focusing on. If you’re in a meeting about developing a new marketing strategy, don’t let people wander off topic and talk about their department’s latest progress unless it’s absolutely relevant. Be careful with your framing. Poor framing can lead people to focus too much on small stuff, like numbers and data, and miss the big picture: progress. One of the biggest mistakes leaders make is framing too broadly or with too much familiarity. If you paint in broad strokes, you run the risk of having your meeting easily getting derailed, and if you focus on the same familiar topics over and over again, people will become bored and unmotivated. Don’t make your staff think outside the box; have them think in a different one. Make them question their assumptions and go into creative mode! Once you’ve assembled your team and set your goals, it’s time to decide where your conversation should take place. Are you content with the same old, dusty conference room? Or is it time to pull people out of their routine and stir their creativity? The decision is an important one, because your venue of choice offers immediate clues about how your meeting will go. Every time you walk into a meeting room, you will pick up subtle cues about the dynamics of the meeting. Even tiny things like the arrangement of the chairs at the table can have major implications: Are chairs and tables arranged with one big, comfortable chair at the head of the table? This could reinforce hierarchy. Or is the setup such that it suggests collaboration? Unfortunately, most leaders plan their meetings by considering everything except the environment. They forget the importance of people’s first impression as they enter the room and the expectations that are built upon those impressions. If you create an environment that looks like a “standard, nondescript meeting,” then people will be less likely to work creatively and develop groundbreaking new ideas. So how do you arrange your meeting room in a way that fits your conversation? One way to is create a space that doesn’t feel like it’s part of the routine. Ensure there is plenty of natural light, and make sure there is enough space so that people don’t feel cramped or stifled. Give them some clear wall space to hang up notes, and make sure that your environment is as free from distractions as possible. If you can create a great meeting space for your strategic conversations, people will feel more motivated and appreciated, and will be more likely to let their creativity flow. Sometimes people make agendas as if they’re planning a march through the country. But they don’t have to be so over-the-top. If you want to make your meetings memorable, simply find the balance between the content and the attendee’s experience. Organizers of large events often see the “experience factor” as being a nice bonus – a small side dish to the main course of content. But why? Simply put, they just aren’t used to thinking any other way. But you want people to remember the content, and that means creating an experience. Attendees should see your meetings as a psychological, emotional and intellectual journey, not a five-hour snooze. Ask yourself what kind of experience your group needs. You could employ unconventional methods, like war games exercises, more traditional role-playing workshops, or customized simulations. Ask yourself: What will engage the people around me the most? Also, be sure to take a step back and let your team discover the solutions. The reason they’re there in the first place is to work on problems and discover solutions and new ideas for themselves. They shouldn’t just be accosted with bullet-point laden power points by speakers who ramble through a script. Try to engage people in their entirety. In other words, don’t just include the sober, rational and stiff stuff. Instead, they should be engaged with heart and guts in your strategic conversation. Make them feel challenged! Turn it into a game! If you want your business to pull ahead, you’re going to need more than a list of numbers and bullet points. The goal of all of these strategies is more refined than simply “finding solutions to your problems.” They aim to solve problems in a specific way – by creating moments of impact – that changes a company’s trajectory forever. Your job, then, is to enable your dream team of professionals to have these life-changing  moments of impact – insights that are so compelling that they demand immediate action. Having created a space of hope and creativity for your group, you will have given them the unique experiences that free the mind and allow for creative new directions for your company. Thus, you want to make sure that your strategic conversations offer more than a vague sense of progress – the future should feel tangible to your conversation participants. To get the participants to switch from vague ideas to tangible action, you’ll need to pull them away from their worries and reservations and open people up to possibilities. As with any new revolutionary idea, many conversation participants will look at the ideas generated at your meeting with a skeptical “yeah, but...” attitude; it’s important that you counteract that skepticism. By giving people a taste of the future, you can start to shift their thinking. Although it won’t totally snuff out people’s doubts and skepticism, it could deprive their doubts of oxygen long enough to get them in a motivated and creative mindset. But fighting skepticism isn’t enough. We want long-lasting change! You’ll need to bring your conversation participants into the hope loop, where people see beyond their achievements and crave more action. For example, when the Rockefeller Foundation organized a conference about socially conscious investments, they followed the principles of these blinks to create moments of impact. As they had intended, conference attendees took action after the conference, launching several new projects, such as the Global Impact Investing Network. The key message in this book: The defining quality of a great leader is her ability to lead productive conversations. The participants are engaged, interested, open and have an opportunity to express themselves genuinely. Not only are these strategic conversations interesting, but they are the cornerstone of successful business growth.

Out of the blue, while you’re taking a shower, it hits you like a thunderbolt: the idea that will transform your company into a unicorn – no, a decacorn! All you’ve got to do is introduce the necessary organizational changes, and it’ll be no time before you’re considering a company valuation in the double-digit billions. But then, after this flash of genius, your brilliant vision smacks into the brick wall of reality. As you try to convince executives and employees to follow you, you feel as though you’ve entered a swamp made of naysaying, doubt, fatigue, poor planning, scarce resources, miscommunication and any number of other corporate ills. So how do you get out of this morass and translate your transformative vision into a business bonanza? That’s what these blinks are all about. From long-term planning to savvy resource allocating, team construction to team cohesiveness, you’ll learn all the skills necessary to make the change happen. You’ll also find out how to make your team members more like sled dogs; the benefits of burning your ships; and when being ruthless is a good idea. Remember that time you decided to start jogging every morning? Remember how everything went so well at first? How, driven by the vision of a fitter, healthier existence, you sprang out of bed, put on your running shoes and clocked up a few miles? And remember how one day of rest became two? And how two became a week? And how you don’t run at all now? Even if you’ve never jogged a mile in your life, one thing is almost certain: you’ve experienced the Middle phase, that tedious and work-intensive period that precedes long-term results and follows the initial excitement of getting started. Many people get bogged down in this phase, which is why dealing with it is the first concern of the MOVE model, which stands for Middle, Organization, Valor and Everyone. So, to get through the Middle, you’ve got to stop being vague and establish small, clear and achievable targets. Here’s an example to demonstrate how this works: Once, the author was working as a consultant for a home electronics business whose goal was as large as it was amorphous; it wanted to improve sales in Europe. The author broke down this big, broad goal by asking two questions. “What,” she asked, “would happen if we achieved this?” And the executives responded that they’d enjoy greater sales in one of Europe’s most important countries, Germany. “And what,” the author pressed on, “would that look like?” Well, the executives discussed the matter, and soon some definite steps began to emerge. They’d need to hire personnel in Germany, for instance, and create partnerships with top German retailers, as well as launch advertising campaigns in the country. In addition to making vague aims more concrete by asking these two questions, you should also keep matters urgent by defining small interim missions. Let’s say you have a large mission – to make bigger deals, and more of them – and that you’ve resolved to close ten such deals by year’s end. Well, since people tend to put off non-urgent tasks, you’ll have to figure out a way to add urgency to this undertaking. So set some shorter deadlines. For instance, aim to have 30 potential deals lined up in nine months, and recognize that for this to happen you need to identify 50 target accounts within half a year. These short-term goals will keep things urgent and propel you past the long-term finish line. It’s an old business bromide: “What gets measured gets done.” And though this adage may contain a kernel of truth, it leaves a crucial question unanswered: by which metrics should success be measured? Using a poor metric is a surefire way to throw a monkey wrench into the works, so it’s imperative that you can separate effective metrics from ineffective ones. When measuring outcomes, you need to choose metrics that are both relevant and able to accurately forecast higher-level results. Here’s an example: Let’s say your company, like many others, strives to provide top-notch customer service. Well, what you don’t want to do is measure things such as the speed of customer-complaint resolution. This might seem like a good metric, but it’s not. After all, it doesn’t really matter how quickly an issue is resolved; what matters is customer satisfaction, and high-speed problem-solving doesn’t guarantee that. So, rather than focusing on isolated activities or particular stages within a process, measure only the desired outcome. An effective metric for customer satisfaction is the number of returning customers. Another is customer referrals, since recommending a company to a friend is usually a sign of satisfaction. Now, knowing what to measure is one thing. Actually measuring it is quite another. You may have to get creative. You could, for instance, have service representatives conclude their interactions with customers by asking whether the customer would recommend your product. Once you figure out how to measure the important stuff, be sure to put resources toward improving those measurements. This is usually a challenge. It’s easy to miscalculate the number of resources such improvement will require – and, of course, resources are usually in short supply. So, to make these calculations less challenging and more accurate, try using the following technique: Sketch out two scenarios, each with a corresponding funding plan. Here’s how this might work. Let’s say a company is having a hard time acquiring customers. For this company, the first scenario would be a low cost one. They’d neither fire nor hire anyone, and the budget would increase by only 10%. This scenario would allow them to tackle only two pressing problems in the next half year. Scenario two, on the other hand, would be a high cost one. They’d increase their budget by 100 percent and hire two new employees – changes that would make them a tip-top customer magnet within their market. Armed with this information, the company can pinpoint its priorities and move resources from one department to another if necessary. Snow spreads white as far as the eye can see. The sound of the sled dogs panting, each breath a small cloud of steam. The cold air taut with anticipation. Briefly, the tow line tenses as the team of dogs braces itself for the coming moment – and then the command: “Mush!” The author noticed something while on a dog-sledding trip. Each sled dog understood its job, and each was aligned with all the others, eager to begin working toward the team mission. So when the time came to “mush” – that is, to go – they weren’t only ready; they were champing at the proverbial bit. So what imbued each canine with such purpose and energy, and how can you imbue your team members with these same qualities? Well, it’s a matter of organization, which is what the O in the MOVE model stands for. First, you’ve got to figure out whether you have all the right pieces and if any new pieces need to be added. You can do this by using the Blank-Sheet Organization Chart, which is what the author resorted to when restructuring a majorly disorganized company. Take a blank sheet of paper and, after you’ve determined the desired outcome and which skill sets will be required to bring about that outcome, start drawing up an ideal team. Don’t leave any role undefined, and get detailed about what will be required of each role, be it negotiation know-how or the ability to drive innovation. Finally, talk to team members you trust and flesh out the roles and requirements using their feedback. Before the author got there, the company she restructured was a mess. Roles within its eight business units were vague, resulting in work overlap, among other problems. The Blank-Sheet Organization Chart transformed the company into a cohesive whole – which is exactly what it can do for your business. Once you’ve figured out where current team members will be most useful and how many new members will have to be found to take on vacant roles, you’ll be well on your way to overcoming challenges of Iditarod-like proportions. If someone offered you $250 to run a marathon, you might do it, right? But, at less than $10 per mile, it hardly seems like enough. If running that marathon contributed to the cure of AIDS or cancer, however – well, you might, like thousands of other people every year, even pay to run it. Why is that? When it comes to motivation, meaning trumps money. So to motivate and engage your team, you’ve got to make its purpose meaningful. And that means forging personal bonds with team members and showing them the bigger picture. Whether during breakfast meetings or one-on-one sit-downs, talk to the people in your company. Invest time both in learning how they feel about the work they do and in communicating how that work helps the company’s overall success. For example, when chatting with a tech writer, you could enumerate the ways that detailed product documentation boosts customer satisfaction, and also mention how it reduces tech-support expenses and increases company competitiveness. Making explicit the connection between the writer’s work and the company’s success will infuse his job with meaning – and, as you know, meaning adds up to engagement. Engaged employees won’t only take ownership of projects and solve problems on their own; they’ll also contribute ideas and insights that may help the company. For example, employees may be able to point out that one department’s progress is misaligned with another’s – something that could derail your company’s long-term transformation strategy. So when employees volunteer information, give them your full attention. You won’t regret it. Of course, your employees won’t get behind the company mission unless you, their leader, are fully dedicated to it. Indeed, the author has noticed that when she wholeheartedly shows that she cares about her company’s mission, her team not only gets inspired; they also feel free to show their own caring and engagement. Emotion drives meaning, so even if you’re a leader at a company that produces lint removers, you’ve got to find something you can care about. If the business is as uninspiring as the product, then seek meaning in the people you serve or the people who work for you. So your team is organized, and you’ve planned out the Middle phase. But when your team actually enters that phase and experiences all the attendant doubt and tedium, a new set of challenges will arise. Exhausted and discouraged, employees will start asking hard questions. Is this even working? Can we go back to what we know? When will we see results? During this tough period, you’ll need Valor – the V in the MOVE model. Being valorous is a matter of drawing on inner and outer resources. Remember, your team members won’t be the only ones plagued by doubts and fears; you’ll have misgivings, too. But here’s the difference: rather than being paralyzed by fear and deciding to turn back, you, the leader, will accept these uncomfortable feelings and push forward. Welcome fear as you’d welcome an old friend. “Hello, fear,” you could say, “it’s fine if you want to join me on this journey, but you’ll have to take a back seat and you certainly won’t be allowed to drive.” In the meantime, seek out more desirable companions – that is, experts and mentors who can advise you on your change strategy. If a change initiative can be likened to Mt. Everest, then these advisors are the Sherpa guides; you’ll have a hard time getting to the top without them. Having valor also means being firm. Once the change initiative begins, there is no going back. Just as Hernán Cortés, the sixteenth-century Spanish colonizer, set fire to all his ships when his fleet landed on the banks of what is now Mexico, you too should destroy all means of retreat. The only option should be to move forward. Your change strategy may involve adding new processes. For instance, you might add checkpoints or guidelines to the company’s software-development program – changes that may prompt complaints from engineers. Yes, it may be challenging for them to learn the new process, but you’ll have to hold your ground. You’ll only see the benefits of a change initiative if you stay firm and implement all necessary changes. No retreat! Here’s a common pitfall. In the quest for organizational change and growth, companies get bogged down in the details. They spend so much time dealing with the “next” pressing issue that they lose sight of the big picture. It’s a classic dilemma. If you’re expending all your energy on becoming a one-hundred-million-dollar company, how will you ever develop a strategy for becoming a one-billion-dollar company? Well, if you really want to change and grow, you’ve got to use ruthless prioritization. No more nitpicking tiny, unimportant details; it’s time to tackle the tough decisions that will actually make a major difference. Ruthless prioritization will inevitably involve trade-offs. So, in order to identify what should grow and what should go, make a list of the three things crucial to your company’s success. These are necessary and non-negotiable. Let’s say you’re a business-to-business (B2B) company with low conversion rates. At the top of your list might be stepping up your referral marketing by implementing a new, more effective, process. After you’ve made your list, ask your team for feedback. Other priorities will doubtless be brought to the table – but under no circumstances should they jeopardize the three top priorities. For your B2B company, the referral marketing process will be implemented. Of course, your company isn’t infallible. If the referral marketing process doesn’t improve your conversion rate, it’s time to acknowledge that a mistake was made and cut your losses. What you don’t want to do is double down. Learn from your missteps and keep on walking. And remember: Don’t get bogged down in the details. When upper-level managers have to review all the details, progress ceases. All managers, at each level of management, should distill details into helpful insights for the managers above them. By no means should the top manager have to spend hours doing the work of lower management – a fact encapsulated in one of the author’s rules of thumb: “Insights move up. Details stay down.” No matter how valorous, a leader won’t succeed in bringing her team through the Middle phase without the active involvement of the people around her. And this is where the E – for Everyone – in MOVE comes in. Getting everyone involved in the change initiative is a matter of substituting conversation for command. Rather than telling employees what the change strategy is, talk to them about how it will work. This, hopefully, will encourage them to discuss it among themselves. When team members talk strategy of their own accord, it’s a sign that real change is taking place. Indeed, it means that company strategy has become familiar, safe and normal. Another way to get employees talking is to create spaces where strategic conversations can take place. Utopia Village, a Honduran resort, created exactly such a space by starting a WhatsApp group called “Utopia Stars.” In this space, every employee could discuss the resort’s new service guidelines, which prioritized excellence above all else. Staff members began documenting instances of excellent service, posting pictures of each other going above and beyond for customers or writing a brief description of what they’d seen other staff members do. Thus, the group sparked a company-wide conversation and gave rise to a new sense of camaraderie. This helped Utopia Village earn a number-one rating on TripAdvisor. And don’t forget – when change begins to happen, be sure to highlight it. This will also encourage conversation and drive further change. Successful highlighting involves two things: everyone has to be able to see it and everyone has to be able to talk about it. For instance, Heifer International, a nonprofit that gives support to livestock-owning families, discovered that it could increase its impact if it convinced families to pass on their livestock’s offspring to new families. So Heifer International created a ceremony celebrating the birth of new livestock. When, for example, a goat provided by the company has a kid, there’s a ceremonial celebration and the goat-owning family passes the newborn on to a new family. This ceremony draws people into the conversation and keeps them involved. In one community, this ceremonial tradition has been carried on for 17 years – without any involvement from Heifer International! The author once brought a middle-aged man to tears with a single question. No, it wasn’t a query filled with malice or implied insult; she simply asked him what he really cared about. So why the outburst of emotion? Well, this man explained that, over the course of his entire career, nobody had ever asked him such a question. The recognition implied by the author’s question – the understanding that the man wasn’t merely a cog in a machine but a human being with his own hopes and feelings – touched him on a deep level. Asking similar questions and paying attention to the answer will help you forge deep bonds with your employees – and such bonds are the foundation of trust and loyalty. Such personal communication will also help you identify which issues are truly troubling your team members, something the author learned in her first real leadership position. During the first two weeks of her time in this role, she talked face-to-face with all her employees – 81 in total. These conversations shaped her entire strategy. For instance, she found out that a certain manager was bullying his team members and damaging company culture, something she wouldn’t have learned otherwise because he was adept at putting on a good face for his superiors. But communication must go beyond one-on-one discussions. You’ve got to keep everyone in the loop. Communicating information both improves engagement and enables people to coordinate with each other. A case in point is an entrepreneurship course offered at Monmouth University in New Jersey. Students are split into four departments: marketing, sales, manufacturing and product development. Every week, each department’s leader posts a status update on an online platform, and each student within that department is required to read both it and all comments. According to the professor, the course’s structure, which centers around communication and information-sharing, is what accounts for the students’ remarkable success rate, with most business plans going from zero to profitable within a mere four months. So stay communicative. An environment where personal and business information can be easily shared will have a much easier time making change a reality. The key message in these blinks: The MOVE model is more than a mere process for implementing change initiatives in any company. Rather, it’s the surest way to achieve lasting change. It does this in four ways – by helping you through the Middle phase of the change process with clear and concrete strategy; by establishing an Organization structure with capacity for change; by giving you the Valor to make the tough decisions and prioritize change; and by showing leaders how to engage Everyone, thus making the change an inextricable part of company culture.  Actionable advice: Create a Timeline. A timeline is a fantastic way to communicate your change strategy and track your progress. When making one, be sure to write major milestones below the line (for instance, “June 1 – Version 2.0 Release”) and specific tasks or initiatives above the line (“April 20 – Launch new media strategy”). Also include a “You are here” marker and make sure it’s not placed at the timeline’s very beginning, as this can be demotivating. Then use the timeline whenever you communicate strategy and update it as your company progresses. Eventually, your team will find motivation in this visual representation of progress. Got feedback?

Why else are movies like Horrible Bosses and TV shows like “The Office” so popular? But surprisingly few of us have ever worked with or truly experienced a great boss. That’s why Liz Wiseman studied the actions of all the different types of bosses and categorized them. In short, a bad boss is a Diminisher, in that they deplete your energy and motivation, and all the other characteristics that make for a good worker. Meanwhile, a good boss is a Multiplier, someone who can make a good employee twice or even 100 times better than they would be on their own. These blinks lay out all the effective habits and principles of Multipliers. By following their lead, you can turn your own workplace into a more productive and healthy environment. You’ll also find out what Magic Johnson can teach us about good leadership; why being a decision maker isn’t always a good thing; and how to set the perfect stage for a productive debate. Generally, there are two kinds of bosses: those who make you feel like you were born to do your job, and those who make you dread going to work in the morning. These are, respectively, Multipliers and Diminishers. Diminishers are the kinds of managers that sap both intelligence and energy out of their employees. While a Diminisher is often a smart person, they’re usually focused more on their own intelligence than they are on taking advantage of the potential smarts within their team. In fact, Diminishers tend to stifle ideas, which results in employees harboring feelings of unfulfillment and inferiority. Let’s look at an example. Vikram was a worker at Intel who had to cope with a manager who was a Diminisher. Even though this manager was an intelligent and capable scientist, he would eat up around a third of every meeting talking about his plans, while shooting down any other idea that wasn’t his own. Eventually, the impression that Vikram and his coworkers got was that their manager didn’t want them thinking for themselves! Diminishers earn their name because these actions have a diminishing effect on the capability and productivity of their underlings. When employees working under a Diminisher were asked about the level of effort they gave, they generally responded with numbers between 20 and 50 percent. Multipliers, on the other hand, do the opposite: they increase the intelligence and achievements of their team. A prototypical example of a Multiplier is the legendary basketball player Earvin “Magic” Johnson. When Magic was a young, up-and-coming star, his high school coach always made sure the other players on the team would pass the ball to Magic so that he could score. This certainly led to the team winning games – but when the games were over, Magic would see sad or disappointed looks on the faces of his teammates’ parents. It was then that he decided he would use his skills to help everyone on his team shine and be the best they could be. And this is how Magic earned his nickname: he had the amazing ability to raise the game of each and every teammate. Most leaders aren’t an extreme Diminisher or Multiplier, but rather fall somewhere in between. So, next, we’ll look at some of the key Multiplier qualities you can start adopting today. In the early twentieth century, British explorer Ernest Shackleton was preparing to launch a groundbreaking yet deadly journey to Antarctica. He needed a skilled crew. Surprisingly, Shackleton didn’t pull any punches in his recruitment ad – it was honest, and stated that danger and death were highly likely. Even so, the ad attracted hundreds of applications. Shackleton had all the options he needed to put together a talented team, which, in turn, helped ensure that every man came back alive. Shackleton is a great example of a specific kind of Multiplier, the Talent Magnet. This is someone who has the ability to bring together an outstanding team, thanks to these four key practices: The first is to look everywhere for talent, regardless of traditional boundaries or hierarchies. If someone is skilled, they are valuable. Second is to ascertain an individual’s instinctive skill, which is generally something they can do very naturally, without even thinking about it. This is likely to mean they won’t need special conditions or circumstances to excel. The author discovered her own instinctive skill after she was confused about always being asked to lead difficult team meetings. Then it was explained to her: she was a natural at explaining ideas and moving issues forward in a way that most others struggle to accomplish. Third is to engage that skill where it’s best suited. Don’t build a team of people who all have the same talent. Instead, a Talent Magnet knows which roles will perfectly suit which talent. Finally, the fourth practice is to remove the obstacles that stand in the way of your team performing at its maximum effectiveness. This may, for example, involve a change in personnel if someone’s ego is getting in the way of others delivering their best work. No matter how talented such a person may be, you need to cut them loose. Do you already have a team? Well, you can still become a Talent Magnet through these three steps. First, identify the specific way your teammates are smart, and let them and the rest of the team know. When high school rugby coach Larry Gelwix saw that a player was impressively fast, he made sure that the player, and the rest of the team, was aware. Prior to Gelwix’s comments, the player only thought he was an okay athlete, but after getting the coach’s praise, he pushed himself even further. Next is to put teammates in a position that allows their talent to shine. If they’re fast, don’t put them in a position that requires a talent for being slow and methodical. Finally, once someone’s hit their limit, don’t keep them tied down. If a teammate has reached the ceiling in their current position, it’s your duty to let them go so they may continue to grow elsewhere. Now that we’ve seen a special type of Multiplier, let’s look at a special Diminisher. If you’ve ever worked for a boss who likes to create a tense atmosphere by throwing their weight around and pointing out everyone’s mistakes, then you’ve known a Tyrant. One well-known Tyrant is Timothy Wilson, a famous props master in Hollywood. Wilson had a reputation for criticizing his staff so relentlessly that few are willing to work with him. But there’s a flip side to the Tyrant personality, which is that of the Liberator. Staying in Hollywood, we can see the Liberator represented by Steven Spielberg. Spielberg is often touted as being able to get people to do their best work. This is because he creates a high-pressure atmosphere in which people want to rise up and do their very best work in an effort to make something great. You can start being a Liberator by following three key practices. First of all, give people room to work. Take a step back and allow your team to do its job, rather than constantly offering your own input. Spielberg knows every job on his crew backward and forward. But instead of persistently offering suggestions, he gives everyone the space they need and trusts in their expertise. Second is to always ask for a team’s best work, without fearing failure. K.R. Sridhar is the CEO of Bloom Energy. He always encourages experimentation. As long as his teams do the best work possible, he never punishes them for a bad outcome. Thanks to this healthy environment, Bloom Energy has been able to innovate across multiple complex technologies. This leads us to the third practice, which is making sure your team knows that they can make mistakes, so long as they learn from them. The former general manager of education business at Microsoft, Lutz Ziob, would never avoid owning up to his mistakes. In fact, he made a point of demonstrating how he learned from them and encouraged others to take risks and try things out. Similarly, he also encouraged feedback. For example, when an employee took Ziob aside to tell him he was overbearing during certain meetings, he appreciated the feedback and asked the employee follow-up questions so he could improve his demeanor. So, to embrace your inner Liberator, give space by offering fewer opinions. When you do, make sure they’re received as suggestions and not orders, and always be sure to acknowledge your mistakes. When Matt McCauley practiced pole vault at college, he kept a bar nearby that was always set at the world record, so he knew where his goal was. McCauley had a similar approach when he became CEO of the children’s retailer Gymboree: by always aiming high, it helped him increase the company’s share price fivefold in just four years, from $0.69 per share to $3.21. Matt McCauley’s leadership approach is that of a Challenger, and this one comes with three distinct practices of its own. First, avoid telling someone where to go or what to do. Instead, point people in a specific direction, where they can develop their own ideas. Irene Fisher is the director of the University of Utah’s Bennion Center for community activism. Rather than explaining where help was needed, she took people to visit poor neighborhoods to see the conditions firsthand. Then, they could come up with solutions on their own. Second, help your team define challenges. Rather than barking orders, Challengers ask questions and pose challenges to people so that they may set the appropriate goals. Matt McCauley began his impressive four-year growth streak at Gymboree by setting an initial dream target of increasing the company’s share value to $1 per share. He then turned to his team and asked each person what they could do to help reach this goal. The final and most important practice is to inspire belief in the possibility of reaching the goals. Even if a target may seem impossible, Challengers can make it seem probable by showing the team that it’s within reach and pointing them in the right direction. This is what McCauley did when he set the improbable goal of $1 per share. His can-do attitude gave everyone the enthusiasm needed to make their own goals seem achievable. According to Time magazine, George W. Bush led a “blink presidency.” He had a tendency to make snap decisions in the blink of an eye, rather than pausing to consult research and weigh the options. This is typical behavior of another type of Diminisher, the Decision Maker. The Decision Maker doesn’t solve problems with analytical thinking. Instead, they’ll bring up issues, seemingly at random, while forcing their own decisions upon the team and ignoring other opinions. The other side of this coin is the far better manager: the Debate Maker. This model is exemplified by the Dutch police chief Arjan Mengerink. Fed up with the traditional top-down hierarchy that had led to numerous failed initiatives, Mengerink reorganized his police force by following three key Debate Maker practices. The first practice is to carefully prepare the issues to be debated so that they can be clearly presented to the staff. The second is to spark an engaging and thorough debate that offers a wide variety of voices and opinions. Mengerink did this by inviting members of the police force from every department and level within the organization to take part in the debate. This included police agents, secretaries, lawyers and captains. He also made it clear that both agreements and disagreements were welcome. The third practice is to make sure that a strong decision is reached in the end. After the details of the debate or discussion are recorded, a decision has to be made by the leadership or through delegation in a way that makes the outcome clear to everyone. This way, it is readily apparent how the process led to a definitive conclusion. Mengerink’s reorganization was a success because all these steps were taken and, as a result, everyone throughout the organization felt that they’d been well represented. They had a stake and belief in the process and thus understood the result. So, to take on the role of the Debate Maker, you need to set up comprehensive debates. In the author’s experience, there are three main techniques to leading a good debate: the leader should only ask questions and never give answers, every answer must be supported by evidence and every participant must give answers. Apply these techniques and you’ll have a foolproof process for setting up great debates. It’s quite common to see the coach of a sports team yelling frantically from the sidelines, but what you never see is the coach actually taking the ball to demonstrate what they mean. Many managers and coaches are Diminishers because of how they micromanage their teams to the point that they become wholly dependent on leadership. This is what happened on Marcus Dolan’s high school rugby team. Dolan was so controlling over every action his team made, that when it came time to compete on the field, the players were unable to think without him and lost every game. The better method is to be an Investor by following these three key practices: First, clearly define the ownership stake your team members have. Make sure everyone on your team knows exactly what they are in charge of and responsible for. By giving workers a sense of ownership, you’ll soon see a motivating feeling of personal investment emerge. Think of it as giving the team 51 percent of the vote, so they have final control. Second, make sure those with responsibilities have the resources they need to succeed. If someone needs a support team to meet his goal, make sure he gets one. And if someone needs to learn something, help him understand what he needs to know and don’t just tell him how it is. You can assist if necessary; otherwise, let him learn on his own. Third is to ensure that these people are held accountable. If you make someone responsible, make sure she knows that the results are up to her. And if someone is presenting info at a meeting and you need to make a correction, don’t take this as an opportunity to take over the meeting. If you take her pen to make an adjustment, make sure you return the pen immediately afterward. To see these practices in action, let’s look again at the successful high school rugby coach, Larry Gelwix. Gelwix’s team was heading to the championships, but they needed to get in much better shape. So he delegated responsibility for improving the team’s fitness to the team captains, and made a clear plan with them. Once the captains agreed to take on this responsibility, Gelwix confirmed the expected results and that he would be checking in on those results in a few weeks. When the captains asked for some detailed information on different fitness regimens, Gelwix made sure they got what they needed. And when all was said and done, the team won the national championship, capping off an undefeated season. Let’s look at the cautionary tale of Sally, an Accidental Diminisher: Sally was a seasoned school principal, with a data-driven approach to leadership. Along with her colleague Marcus, Sally was tasked with helping the school achieve “blue ribbon” status. Since Marcus was relatively new to his role, Sally was eager to guide him by providing a constant flow of instructions and feedback. But, of course, Marcus eventually had to tell Sally to stop; her smothering “assistance” was preventing Marcus from making any progress. In her research, the author has found many Accidental Diminishers like Sally. They come in many different forms and often come from a place of good intentions. Another version is the Optimist, which the author, Liz Wiseman, can sometimes slip into. During an important research project with a colleague, Wiseman had continually asked, “How hard could it be?” With this remark, Wiseman was only trying to ease some of the pressure and encourage some confidence. But it led her colleague to eventually tell her that this continual optimism was actually undermining the genuine difficulty of their project. So what her research partner really needed was to hear Wiseman acknowledge that it was, in fact, quite hard! As you can see, it can be all too easy to slip into an Accidental Diminisher role. One of the best ways to avoid this is to ask for regular feedback from a trusted source. When Wiseman was teaching a workshop in Abu Dhabi, she asked participants to turn to the person next to them and share one way in which they might be accidentally diminishing others. The exercise was a great success, so much so that participants took it upon themselves to create feedback groups with those they worked closest with. They understood that good leadership requires an awareness of how you’re perceived by those you lead. We’ve looked at the different ways a boss can try to change their methods and be the best they can be, but let’s look at things from a worker’s perspective: what should you do if your boss is a Diminisher and makes you feel underutilized and overly criticized? According to the author, the five most common strategies are confrontation, avoidance, quitting, lying low and ignoring. Yet these are also the five least effective strategies! So what is the right thing to do? Start by learning some defensive practices. Rather than making any snap judgments or rash decisions, try to regroup and figure out what the problem is and how you might make a suggestion that could defuse the conflict. One executive at Apple recalls a time when she was criticized by Steve Jobs. Rather than countering and starting an argument, she regrouped and cooled off, which allowed Jobs to soften his position as well. She was then able to approach him with a new solution that combined both their ideas – and they were both happy with it. If the problem is being micromanaged, try to find a friendly way to remind your boss that you’re qualified to work without constant oversight. One colleague of the author would defuse this scenario by making a joke about “loosening the choke chain.” This made the message clear and no one had their authority challenged. Another method is to be your own Multiplier and use the key practices on your boss. For example, you can use their skills to your advantage. Another executive at Apple would keep Steve Jobs from exerting too much control during development by asking for his insight at key moments. This would both take advantage of his insight and keep him from feeling like he needed to butt in. Likewise, you may find relief by inviting along a nuisance boss instead of trying to shut them out. Sometimes, a boss will intervene if they’re unsure of your capabilities, so one way of removing their doubt is to invite them to see your talent firsthand. One manager had a senior boss who would routinely interfere at important meetings, so she invited him to one and asked him to kick the meeting off before letting her take the lead. It worked like a charm; after the meeting, he had a newfound enthusiasm for her work. Bill Campbell was CEO of the software manufacturer Intuit, and he has leadership experience as both a Diminisher and a Multiplier. Several times, Campbell’s team has had to tell him to step back and stop smothering them; on other occasions, he’s snapped at a silly question. But Campbell has learned from these mistakes and he’s even gone on to serve as a board member, nurturing other up-and-coming Multipliers. The lesson from Campbell’s story is that anyone can reset their role as a leader – all it takes is recognizing this need and a willingness to change. If any of the Diminisher traits in these blinks sound similar to some of your habits, or those of your boss, you should already be feeling the need to take action. When you’re the one with Diminisher tendencies, the first step is to realize that you need to change; the second step is to have the resolve to follow through on that change. Fortunately, there are fast-track practices to becoming a Multiplier. The first is to understand that Multipliers aren’t perfect at everything, so you’ll be better off focusing on one skill that you can maximize and one weakness that you can neutralize. If you can accomplish this, you’ll be on your way to showing Multiplier tendencies. Let’s say you’re already leaning toward being a Challenger, since you’re good at pushing your staff to work hard, but you’re also a little bit of a Tyrant when it comes to giving your employees space. In this scenario, you could maximize your Challenger by setting ambitious goals, and minimize your Tyrant tendencies by giving your team more room to breathe. With just these two moves, you’ll be the Multiplying champ! Another fast-track practice is to challenge your assumptions. If you compare your business assumptions against the key Multiplier practices, you can quickly begin to spot your weaknesses, change your attitudes and put a stop to the diminishing. For example, if you think you should only consult a couple of the top team members, you should recognize how the principles of the Debate Maker suggest otherwise. Or, if you think more pressure makes for better workers, you’ll see that this defies the Liberator practices. You could also get some quick feedback by asking a colleague to tell you where your strengths and weaknesses lie and how you could improve. Finally, don’t stop with yourself when you can build a Multiplier culture. Help these principles seep into your organization by sharing this discourse and behavior with your employees or coworkers. Soon, Multiplier practices will become an everyday part of your working environment. This will help everyone unleash their unique genius, regardless of their job title. The key message in these blinks: Multiplying the talents and motivations of those around you is good for everyone. It makes workers feel fulfilled and it saves on resources – after all, multiplying existing resources beats adding additional ones every time. By engaging the practices of the Talent Magnet, the Liberator, the Challenger, the Debate Maker and the Investor, and suppressing any accidental diminishing, you can become a better leader and help others reach their full potential. Actionable advice: Run an experiment. If you can identify an area where you might be accidentally diminishing somebody, counter it by applying one of the Multiplier practices. For example, if you’ve realized that you might be a bit of a Tyrant and tend to dominate debates, then try a game where you give yourself a limited number of chips during a meeting. Each chip represents a contribution you can make, so be sure to use them only when you really have to. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Whether it’s a stale relationship or unsatisfying job, it can be difficult to put an end to what we don’t like. It turns out that human beings are remarkably flexible when it comes to putting up with things that suck joy out of their lives. Sometimes it’s important that we relieve ourselves of unwanted baggage so we can live fuller lives. Whether that means closing down a struggling business and going back to school or ending an abusive relationship, we need to take the plunge because the grass is almost always greener on the other side. In these blinks, you’ll learn how to make endings a normal, habitual part of your life; what signs you should look out for that indicate something should come to an end; and why it’s sometimes necessary to get someone else to end things for you. At some time or other, we’ve all hit that wall. We’re facing the end, and there’s nothing to be done. It’s a universal experience, and it can be galling. But it’s important to remember that endings serve a purpose. They mean we will eventually thrive in professional and personal settings. They are, in fact, necessary. For instance, there are times when it’s best to draw a line under a business venture or a product line. Perhaps a new technology has rendered those efforts unprofitable. Even design classics like the Walkman cassette player had to be put to bed eventually. It’s true of fashion trends too. Flared corduroy trousers might have been all the rage in the 1970s, but the current low demand means that there’s no point producing quite so many pairs anymore. Sometimes, even employees have to be let go. Why keep someone around if they aren’t living up to their promise? That's the time to find a better replacement who will help you achieve your long-standing objectives. What’s true in business is also true in our personal lives. Endings are inevitable, but they mean we can move on. An unsupportive relationship or friendship prevents us from blooming, and a dysfunctional or violent relationship or an unhealthy friendship is worse still. But your relationship with yourself is harder to see. Just think about your behavioral patterns or harmful habits. Maybe you’re too reliant on your parents’ support, for instance. Simply put: endings are good things. They are necessary. Without them, we’d all be unhappily married to our high school sweethearts, stuck in our first jobs, or burdened with unreliable employees. We'd never reach our goals or actualize our dreams. The gardener pruning his rosebushes has a clear goal in mind: healthy buds and vibrant colors. The question is, how's your metaphorical rosebush going to look? Ask yourself why and to what end you're pruning. In short, what are your goals? You might prune so that you have the energy to march out happy and contented each day. You might need, for example, to pare down a professional or personal relationship that’s getting a little invasive. In business, too, a little pruning is required, even when you have annual growth targets. Consider Jack Welch, the former CEO of General Electric. Welch pruned to push his business into the top two in the market. That meant cutting unproductive business initiatives, conducting annual layoffs, and paring away red tape. Under Welch, GE’s market value skyrocketed from a “mere” $14 billion to an astounding $410 billion. That’s some way to meet a target. In order to make the most out of endings, you have to normalize them. It’s common to think of endings as negative occurrences. That’s why we tend to avoid them. But as soon as we see endings as normal, there’s no reason to be afraid and run away from them. Imagine a small businessman. Let’s call him Blair. He used to be in the chemical manufacturing industry, but as technology advanced, his line of work became obsolete. He fought hard. He invested more money and searched ceaselessly for new potential customers. But it was no use. He was faced with the inevitable reality. Of course, it’s possible to fight and persevere. But that isn’t always for the best. Blair understood that so he folded his business. He went back to school and found a second successful career in investment. But how do we work out what’s worth fighting for? We’ll explore that next. As endings can be painful, we do everything within our power to avoid them. But how do we know when an ending is required? For starters, past action is a good indication of future behavior. So look to the past if you want to predict possible futures. What does this mean in practice? Let’s consider how the author counseled a friend who approached him for advice. The friend had a daughter whose boyfriend had proposed, and he was unsure if he should give his blessing to the couple. The author suggested his friend ask to see the boyfriend’s tax returns and a credit report. It’s not a question of money and means, but one of commitment and responsibility. If the boyfriend can't be trusted with credit or tax forms, how could he be entrusted with the friend’s daughter and with making a lasting commitment? Whether it’s a partner, business, or an employee, when it comes to straightforward futures, the past will hold the answer. The second indicator of success in a given scenario or situation is the trustworthiness of the person responsible. Examine the characteristics of the person you’re dealing with. It doesn’t matter if it’s a collaborator, business partner, son-in-law, or your own partner. Look closely. Can you trust him or her with the task in hand? Imagine you run a comedy club. Success depends on getting the punters to laugh and tell their friends, so you sell more tickets. One night you hire an amateur, but he dies on stage. He promises next time will be different. So, should you employ him again or get a proven professional next time? The pro will always be safer and more trustworthy if you want to keep your reputation intact. In short, if you want to know what the future will hold, analyze those on whom success depends. Endings seem hard because they require change. Because most of us only make changes when they're absolutely necessary, endings are particularly tricky. We need to be pushed by fear and pulled by the possibility that the new scenario will be even better. We’re best driven by a sense of urgency – whether it’s a need to escape a disappointing situation or to reach a better place. Imagine you’re running a chair-selling business. It’s not going so well, but you manage to keep things afloat. Now, what would you do if an employee told you a rival was selling trendier and cheaper products? Most likely you’d terminate your contract with your supplier and find a new one who can deliver you resources cheaper. Your employee created urgency and motivated you to change. If you’re using the power of urgency properly, then you've got to be realistic about your present situation. Can you imagine being in the same situation in the future? Most people need to smell smoke before they flee a burning building. That’s because it’s only then that they’re confronted with reality. Try this exercise. Stand in front of a mirror and be honest with yourself. What does your current situation feel like? Sense it: feel it, smell it, and imagine it playing out. Now, think about the future. Take those present sensations with you. Could you imagine still being surrounded by those same emotions and sensations in three or four years’ time? Of course not. Use that sense of dissatisfaction to create the urgency needed to make an ending. Would you, to use our example, still want to be scrimping by, selling the same old chairs, or really pushing your business forward and running with new market trends? Imagine you’re in a loving and close relationship with a man. But his noncommittal behavior means it’s difficult to picture a future with him. Nonetheless, you love him and can’t envisage bringing the relationship to an end. So what do you do? The first thing is to be clear with him. Clarify what your standards are, and then let him self-select. This means you communicate to the person your wants and desires and then allow him or her to consider if they can be met. If they can’t, then that’s that. You have your ending. You should declare your aspirations. For instance, you might want a partner who can be a solid husband, a father to your children, responsible, financially competent and passionate rather than lazy. Don’t be afraid to tell him. Finally, you can ask him if he is prepared to be that person for the long-term security of the relationship. However, not all decisions work like this. If it’s a matter that concerns you alone, then you will have to do your own self-selection. Say you recently moved to New York but couldn’t find work, or say you wanted to boost your failing one-person company. In both these circumstances, you’re the one who has to make the decision. At this point, you should be clear to yourself about your standards and expectations. This will mean you can self-select. Perhaps you could set expectation deadlines for yourself such as “If I don’t have a decent job by October, I'll move back home,” or “If my finances are still in the red in six months, I'll dissolve my company.” So, you’ve made the decision to end things. But how do you execute that decision? If you've ever had to end a romantic or professional relationship, you’ll know the conversation involved can be terrifying. Many people stall. It’s understandable. Let’s consider the hypothetical example of Lori and Jeff. For years, Jeff was Lori’s right-hand man in the advertising company where she worked as an executive. Jeff was sharp and performed amazingly. But he lacked social skills. Sometimes Lori found herself “cleaning up” after the mess he’d made. One day, Lori was offered a position at another firm where she could assemble her own team. After careful consideration, Lori decided against bringing Jeff. She just couldn’t face the drama anymore. She didn’t need to waste her time or energy on it. Nonetheless, despite having made her mind up, Lori procrastinated. Not because of the decision but because of the conversation involved. There’s a clear solution. You have to prepare yourself for these conversations by visualizing the end goals beyond the specifics of the conversation. To be able to follow through, you have to have a clear mind and clear objectives. If you don’t, you could get derailed by the other person trying to persuade you, or by the love you have for them. A good way to achieve clarity is to decide in advance what you want to say. Know what you want before you begin. Imagine you want to end an abusive relationship. You’d want to tell your former partner never to contact you again and that the authorities will be involved if he does. Only when you’ve fixed your goals can you begin the conversation. When you have clear objectives, you’ll be much better prepared for the uncomfortable conversation which ends it all. The key message in this book: It’s sometimes necessary for endings to arrive sooner rather than later. Relationships with employees, partners, friends, or business managers shouldn’t be sustained if they keep you from thriving. You have to take action, draw a line under the past and learn to move on. Actionable advice: Assess an ending and be clear about your intentions. Moods are contagious. Being affected by others can help you follow through with tricky endings. If you’re having difficulty escaping an unhealthy relationship, you should surround yourself by an ending alliance – a group of people who, like you, see the urgency for the ending. Being around these people will create a pressure that influences you positively to make the necessary ending happen. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

It might be a good friend, an acquaintance, a parent or perhaps even the love of your life, but you might suddenly find that you can’t get past the same cycles of disagreement on the same issues, over and over again. Soon enough, you realize you’ve spent the whole morning, day or even week in a state of anguish and without having made any progress toward a resolution. So how can we get past the insidious entrapments of interpersonal conflicts, and what do our self-perception and identities have to do with it? Well, as you’ll find out in these blinks, the way we perceive ourselves actually has a key influence on our approach to conflict. In these blinks, you’ll learn what constitutes your identity; how your identity can act as a primary trigger of conflicts; and what vertigo has to do with arguments. We’ve all had an argument at some point. But to resolve conflicts, we need to understand the complex dynamics at play. Traditionally, it's believed that two main factors contribute to conflict, namely rationality and emotion. We generally begin an argument by appealing to rationality. The side of our personalities that appeals to rationality and rational decision making is known as the homo economicus, which, naturally enough, is a concept taken from the field of economics. This concept posits that we act as individuals. We try to maximise our own gains, as well as those which are mutually beneficial, especially when it comes to money or time. The other factor at play is emotion. Emotions, such as fear, anger or trust, are often irrational but can nevertheless dominate our perception. A good shorthand for this part of our personality is homo emoticus. However, beyond the two factors of rationality and emotions that are generally cited as the core of conflict, there's a third factor to consider that is often overlooked: identity. Identities are formed by our self-conception and by our search for meaning in existence. We’re as much homo identicus as we are homo economicus or homo emoticus. Identity is also the foundation for tribes, which are defined as groups united by similar ideas, values or religious beliefs. But let’s make this idea more concrete by looking at an experiment, conducted by the author, to show the power of tribe identity in conflicts. A total of 45 participants were randomly divided into six groups, with each group then being asked a series of questions on a range of themes. What were their opinions on capital punishment, or what did they consider the most important values of each tribe? After 50 minutes of discussion, the groups had to choose just one tribe out of the six to represent all of them. If they failed to do so, the earth would supposedly be destroyed. The author repeated this experiment around the world with many different groups, and despite the high imaginary stakes, the earth was only “saved” a handful of times! It's clear that participants became so wrapped up in their new identities that they preferred to destroy the planet rather than take on the identities of another group. New tribal bonds formed so strongly and so quickly that the conflict simply couldn’t be resolved. If you’ve taken a moment to consider it, you've probably already recognized the two constituent parts of your identity. First, there’s what’s called core identity. These are the characteristics that make you who you are, which can be subdivided into five further elements. These are beliefs, including morals; rituals, such as eating with your family; allegiances, like patriotism; values, including justice; and emotionally meaningful experiences, such as the birth of a child. And it’s not just individuals that have core identities. Social groups, companies or states can have them too, which is precisely how personalities, brand values and constitutions all take shape, respectively. While your core identity isn’t necessarily fixed in the sense that you could, for instance, adopt new and different values, in the end your subjectivity and core essence would remain unchanged, and you would still remain yourself as an individual. By way of contrast, let’s turn now to relational identity. This defines you according to your relationship to other persons or groups. Remember the tribe experiment from the previous blink? The groups had three rounds of negotiation to save the world. When they began, the different tribes worked as colleagues toward their joint goal. However, as negotiations continued, tensions arose and their willingness to cooperate disintegrated. Why was this? The author thought it happened because they experienced rejection. In light of this rebuff, their relational identity – which fluctuates more easily than core identity – shifted. Tensions arose because the groups realized how other groups perceived them. Relationships between groups were tested and became strained, but core identity had nothing to do with it. Core identity is built on finding meaning within ourselves; in contrast, relational identity is formed from finding meaning through coexistence and association. The existence of relational identity explains why maintaining an atmosphere of cooperation is so important when it comes to achieving success in negotiations or conflicts. We’ve all been there, arguing with someone and feeling utterly sure that our perspective is the correct one. When it seems that nothing can distract us from our absolute certainty, there’s likely one specific factor causing us to think this way; it’s called the Tribes Effect. The Tribes Effect is a mindset that pits your identity against your opponent’s, leading to a case of “you versus me” or “us versus them.” In the end, this is an evolutionarily sound principle, in that it protects groups and bloodlines from outsiders, but it can likewise be scaled down to a two-person conflict. The Tribes Effect often kicks in to protect your identity from attack. It’s wise to learn how to recognize when this occurs, as the Tribes Effect tends to generate a self-righteous, adversarial and closed mind-set. And this is also something you can feel! You’ll think that you’re in the right, unable to see what you have in common with your adversary; you'll only see the differences and won’t listen to arguments. So what triggers the Tribes Effect? Simple – it takes hold whenever our identity is threatened. Even seemingly minor differences between people can spark the Tribes Effect into action. To illustrate this, the author carried out an exercise in which people were told to argue the comparative importance of “humanitarianism” and “compassion.” While outsiders might consider the distinction to be trifling, and perhaps not even worth debating, this made the results of the experiment all the more interesting. The author found that once the Tribes Effect took hold, minor differences led to major conflicts. The participants felt their identity to be threatened if they gave way on the beliefs they had invested in. Any inch of concession or modification of belief was perceived as a defeat. Have you ever been deep in an argument with someone only to notice that half an hour has flown by, even though it only felt like five minutes or so? This effect is known as vertigo. Vertigo is like a trap. When you’re ensnared by it, it seems as if your conflict is the only thing that exists; it becomes all-consuming. The symptoms of vertigo are difficult to address. You'll forget your surroundings, stop being able to self-reflect properly and will only focus on negative ideas. Let’s consider a hypothetical example of a husband shopping with his wife. She sees a bedspread she wants, but he doesn’t like it. What begins as a minor dispute spirals out of control, and before long they are questioning why they ever got married! Suddenly, they notice that 20 minutes have passed. They've been completely sucked into vertigo and have blotted out everything else around them. They have entered their own world and their abilities to self-reflect have been lost in a cloud of negativity. So how do you avoid vertigo? The first step is to be aware of its presence, to begin with. Ask yourself these questions if you find yourself in the midst of an argument with someone. First, has the conflict consumed you? If your mind is on it and nothing else, you’re probably in a state of vertigo. Second, do you see your sparring partner as only an enemy? If you think of the other person as an adversary rather than as a person with differing opinions, vertigo is likely the cause. If this is the case, you should take a deep breath and slow down while trying to moderate your perspective. This will help you stop vertigo from taking over; while it’s an instinctive tribal impulse, it can be overcome. Another signifier of tribal conflict are taboos, which we'll learn about in the next blink. Pause and have a quick think about your friendships and relationships. Are there any things you just don’t like to discuss with people? There almost certainly are, and it’s likely they would lead to conflict if you did. These social transgressions are called taboos. Certain groups define their taboos according to feelings, ideas or urges that they deem unacceptable to feel, think or act upon. Consider premarital sex, a prime example of a religious taboo. In essence, taboos exist to protect individuals from what are seen as offensive values by a certain community. Nonetheless, taboos are relative rather than absolute, and aren’t universally offensive. A given society might punish and ostracize those who transgress, but remember, too, that without the threat of punitive measures, a taboo might not seem like such a misdemeanor after all. Taboos, however, are indeed part of the tribal mind, and thus part of our identity. Therefore, conflicts can arise between tribes that differ in opinion as to whether a certain action is a taboo or not. However, there’s a way to confront taboos if they are a cause of conflict. First of all, you must recognize the taboo, then create a safe space to discuss it and finally agree on whether to accept or disregard it. Accepting a taboo is one way of resolving conflict. Even so, it’s important to note that though acceptance may lead to harmony in the short term, acceptance may not last forever; things can always change. Perhaps you live in a country that has a taboo against drinking excessively. If a good friend of yours has a drinking problem, you might be able to accept it at first – but over time your attitude may shift in order to reflect cultural norms. Disregarding a taboo can also be difficult because doing so can be perceived as a very direct action. But it’s not impossible. Consider Nelson Mandela. He addressed taboos that forbade white and black people from interacting and mixing in South Africa, and it was through bold activism that he set in motion the beginning of the end of apartheid. In summary, by confronting taboos, we can forge better relationships. Think back to the last time you were quarreling with someone. There’s a good chance you saw yourself as the victim in the situation, and this attitude is caused by what’s known as the mythos of identity. The mythos of identity refers to the self-written narrative that fixes one’s identity in relation to someone else. We each have a mythos, and the most common constellation is to think of ourselves as a victim and our adversary as the villain. The author examined this phenomenon in a game he set up. Participants were divided into two classes, one representing the economic elite, the other the lower-income class. The former group was given more money and resources. After three rounds of free trading designed to maximize individual wealth, the elites were allowed to set new rules. The elites imagined themselves as saviors of the poorer Lower classes and implemented rules designed to benefit the lower classes – but they didn’t actually ask the Lower classes what they wanted! Conversely, the lower classes presumed the elites were out to exploit them. This showed that both groups were attached to their respective mythos of identity, which just compounded the in-game conflict. But if we set out to understand others’ mythos, we’ll be better equipped to resolve conflicts. There’s a three-step method that can resolve conflicts where the mythos of identity is involved. It’s called creative introspection. First, establish a brave space. Here, people can freely discuss sensitive issues without judgment. Second, identify each other's mythos. This way, you’ll understand why the other person is behaving as he is. Perhaps an arrogant colleague is overcompensating because he was bullied as a child; in the end, he’s simply used to being a victim. Finally, revise your own mythos. Let’s use the imaginary arrogant colleague as an example. Perhaps you could support and encourage his work, or maybe you could give him more responsibilities, which will allow him to revise his mythos. From there, you can start making victims into leaders. Have you ever wanted to exact revenge on someone? It’s an understandable desire, but it’s not worth it. In the end, it won’t solve the deeper pain, and there are more productive ways to deal with anguish. First of all, it’s important to acknowledge emotional pain – not just the hurt you’re feeling, but also the pain felt by your adversary. Emotional pain has two aspects. Raw pain is that gut reaction you feel in the moment, and which you can identify by examining the immediate sensation of your emotions and body. For instance, do you have a knot in your stomach or tight shoulders? The other type is suffering, which is the feelings you receive when you try and understand the raw pain. Suffering can manifest itself as the desire for revenge or anger that bad things keep happening to you. You can overcome both sentiments if you understand what provokes them. For instance, if the thought of seeing your boss might be bringing you out in cold sweats, maybe this is because he dislikes your ideas. Perhaps this is indicating that you’d like more praise for your work than you first thought. The second stage is to mourn the loss you’ve suffered. There’s no way around it – all conflict entails loss of some sort. A couple in the midst of a divorce is losing the possibility of a future together, while warring armies must each mourn their lost comrades and friends. It’s one thing to understand loss as an intellectual exercise, but it’s quite another to handle it on an emotional level. An important step that will allow you to mourn is to comprehend and appreciate your loss. For some, this is best done verbally, through conversations or simply by asking yourself what makes the loss so traumatic. For others, rituals, such as religious ones, are helpful. The final step is to contemplate forgiveness. Forgiveness is the most difficult stage of all, but once you’ve forgiven, you’ll no longer see yourself as a victim and the urge for revenge will dissipate. In every relationship you have, it’s essential to temper emotional pain. Reconciliation can only be achieved by shifting perspectives brought about by confronting this pain. There may be times when you think a conflict seemingly has no solution, but this is probably because you haven’t yet shifted your perspective and, in doing so, have not reconfigured your relationship to your adversary. The first step in this process is to identify the identity under threat. Now is the time to take on the mythos of identity we learned about earlier. Consider a real-life situation: Linda and Josh are a couple. Linda, who’s Protestant, wanted a Christmas tree; Josh, however, was averse to the idea because he’s Jewish. In this case, the Christmas tree is actually a symbol for something deeper. When Linda was young, her mother died and, from then on, her father would always put up a tree for her. For Linda, it represented her father's love; meanwhile, for Josh, it felt like a betrayal of his family values. The second step is to use the SAS system, which is the method used for envisaging how identities might coexist harmoniously. It comprises three stages: First, separate the identities. For our couple, this could mean dividing the house up. One part could be set aside for Christmas festivities. Second, assimilate. This means embracing a part of your adversary's identity. Linda could, for instance, adapt to Josh’s beliefs or vice versa. The third and final stage of the SAS system is to synthesize, which allows both core identities to coexist. The couple can still have a tree; for Linda, it could be a Christmas tree, while Josh could think of it as a Hanukkah decoration. Returning to the broader process of reconfiguring your relationship to your adversary, the final step is to deliberate which scenario or combination of scenarios might work best. Use the SAS system to evaluate possible options to overcome the conflict, which might range from unrealistic to realistic. Then, decide together what works best. In the end, Linda and Josh decided against a Christmas tree, and instead decided to celebrate Christmas at Linda’s father’s house. This way, they were able to respect all their traditions, rituals and beliefs. It can take time to reconfigure a relationship, but it’s always worth the effort if you want to succeed when resolving conflicts. The key message in this book: To resolve conflicts, it’s essential to be aware of the relationship between adversaries as well as how they see themselves. By being critical of yourself as well as of others, remaining aware of social taboos and examining the personalized narrative that defines your identity, you will be well equipped to resolve many of the conflicts you confront. In the end, no conflict is non-negotiable. Actionable Advice The next time you find yourself feeling personally offended in an exchange with someone, consider taking a step back and examining which part of your identity is under threat. Is it the part that considers yourself to be a proud, progressive liberal, or a nurturing, caring parent? If so, you might be experiencing an assault on the aspects of your identity that seem most sacred to you. Recognizing that you will not always execute every role perfectly might help dissipate the anger and offense that you feel. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Most of us fail to convince others on a fairly regular basis. No matter how hard we try, our pleas fall on deaf ears. That’s because we aren’t negotiating right. And that’s exactly where these blinks come in. You’ll find out the secrets of successful negotiation from none other than Chriss Voss, once the FBI’s number one international kidnapping negotiator. You will also learn: which emotional characteristic is your strongest weapon; what kind of voice to use when negotiating; and how labeling can save lives. People tend to think of negotiation as something reserved for lawyers and corporate board rooms, but the truth is, humans negotiate in every part of life. In other words, while negotiating is what the police do when dealing with hostage situations, it’s also something that happens at work, at home, with your partner and with your kids. In a simple sense, negotiation is just trying to get things to go your way; it’s having an interaction or communication with a specific outcome in mind. Whenever two or more people want something from one another, negotiation is taking place. Say you want a raise and your boss wants your salary to stay where it is. Or maybe you want your kids to go to bed by eight, but they want to stay up till ten. OK, so negotiation is more common than most people think. But what makes for a successful negotiator? It’s more than just mathematical logic and a keen intellect. That’s because humans aren’t always rational; they often fail to act on the basis of logic or reason. To make matters more complicated, humans aren’t always predictable either. People often act based on their animal nature, which is irrational, spontaneous and a bit wild. That’s precisely what the psychologist Daniel Kahneman and the economist Amos Tversky found after years of study. Their findings challenged conventional thinking on negotiation. Here’s how. In the 1970s, when negotiation first became defined as a field, it was based on the assumption that each individual acted rationally and to her own advantage. However, Tversky and Kahneman’s research discovered that humans are prone to what’s called cognitive bias, which makes them unconsciously irrational. They even identified 150 different types of biases, including the so-called framing effect; this concept states that, when faced with the same options, people will make different choices depending on how the alternatives are framed. Simply put, to be a successful negotiator, your approach has to take into account the complex nature of humankind. In the blinks that follow, you’ll learn how to do just that. Good negotiators approach the bargaining table attempting to gain as much information as possible, both about the situation and their counterpart. Naturally, during this process, new stuff comes to light, so success means being prepared for a bend in the road. For instance, you won’t really know what a hostage-taking terrorist wants or how he’ll behave; he might be armed even though you were told that he wasn’t; he could even feed you incorrect information to lead you astray. A real-life example of such a situation dates back to 1993 when the author was involved in negotiations after a robbery resulted in the taking of three hostages in a Manhattan bank – two bank tellers and a security guard. The robber who communicated with the FBI said that there were four robbers, but he was in fact alone; while his partners had just robbed the ATM, he went for the whole bank, taking hostages in the process. Looking back on the situation, the author realizes that the robber only spread this misinformation to confuse the author and his colleagues, buying himself time to plot his escape. So, information is key, and to get it you need to establish an amicable rapport with your counterpart. That’s why one goal of negotiation is to get the other party to talk a lot. As she does, you’ll be able to figure out what she needs and wants. That being said, nobody is going to provide you with information if they don’t trust you, and that’s why rapport is essential. If you manage to establish it, you’ll build trust in the process, making it much more likely that the other person will divulge useful information. But how can you establish rapport? Explore the next blink to find out. So, you know that trust is key, but how do you establish it? The best route is to engage in active listening, which means showing empathy and demonstrating that you understand what the other person is going through. Several techniques can help. The first is called mirroring, which essentially means repeating what your counterpart says but with an inquisitive tone. Just consider the Manhattan bank robbery negotiation from the previous blink. The robber in that situation, Chris Watts, made continual demands for a vehicle. He mentioned that his own car was gone as his driver had fled. Hearing this, the author mirrored it by saying, “Your driver was chased away?” In response, Watts went on to say that the driver had fled when the police arrived on the scene. The author held onto this information, along with other tidbits he teased out through mirroring, many of which assisted the FBI and NYPD in apprehending the driver. But why does mirroring work? Largely because it makes the other person feel that you’re similar to him. After all, your counterpart is only human and will naturally be drawn to similarities. That’s because, just like other animals, people like to be in groups with similar traits. Doing so gives us a sense of belonging and forges trust. This is powerful in a negotiation: when your counterpart starts to trust you, he will become more likely to talk and find a solution. To test the effects of this approach more scientifically, the psychologist, Richard Wiseman conducted an experiment in which waiters would take orders from customers. One group of waiters was asked to use mirroring while the other was asked to utilize positive reinforcement through phrases like “no problem” and “great.” In the end, the waiters who mirrored the orders made by customers received much higher tips, earning 70 per cent more than the other group. Have you ever been upset with another person not because of what she said, but because of how she said it? Well, it makes sense since intonation and the human voice are powerful tools that you can use in successful negotiating. For instance, if the other party is likely to become upset or nervous, you should employ a deep but soft voice, or what the author has called your Late-Night FM DJ voice. By being slow and reassuring, this tone is sure to have a profound effect on the other person. After all, it’ll comfort him, making him more likely to share the information you’re looking for. At a certain point during the bank robbery negotiation, the author had to take over communication with the robber from his colleague, Joe. To prevent Watts from growing upset or nervous due to the shift, the author told him in a deep, calm voice that Joe was out and he was in. It was put forward in such a downward-inflecting manner, radiating calmness and reason, that Watts didn’t even flinch. That being said, most situations call for a different tone, namely your positive/playful voice. This voice communicates that you’re easygoing and empathetic; it puts things in a positive light with an encouraging attitude. If you smile while speaking, this voice will often come out naturally. Even if your counterpart can’t see your smile, it’ll come through in the tone of your voice. While on vacation in Istanbul, a colleague of the author’s was amazed by his girlfriend’s ability to cut great deals with backstreet spice merchants. He soon realized that she always pushed for better prices, but did so in a playful, positive way. While the merchants were themselves skilled bargainers, her approach drew them in, convincing them to give her a better deal. Try this yourself, when you’re at a store or market! In psychotherapy, progress is made by tapping into and understanding a patient’s emotions. The same goes for negotiation. Rather than ignoring emotions, you have to combine them with empathy to your tactical advantage. However, being empathetic doesn’t necessarily mean agreeing with the other person. It just means attempting to see his perspective. This is where tactical empathy comes into play; it refers to using your understanding of your counterpart’s perspective to better position yourself in the negotiation. One technique to do so is called labeling. It simply refers to telling your counterpart that you understand and acknowledge both his position and feelings. This simple approach works by calming the other person down and making him behave more rationally. Just take a 2007 study by psychologist Matthew Lieberman at the University of California. Lieberman showed participants pictures of people expressing a strong emotion, thereby activating their amygdalas, the brain area responsible for fear. However, when the same participants were asked to state what emotions they saw, their brains experienced activity in the areas related to rational thinking. Or consider an example from 1998 when four prison fugitives, believed to be in possession of automatic weapons, hid out in a Harlem apartment. The author figured out what they were feeling and then labeled those feelings; he told them that he knew they didn’t want to leave the apartment, that they were worried that if they opened the door, they would be shot and that they must be scared of going back to prison. After six hours of dead silence, the fugitives surrendered and later told the author that he had calmed them down. In other words, his labeling had worked. He simply understood and acknowledged their emotions, reaching a favorable outcome in the process. Have you ever been in such a hurry to settle a dispute that you ended up unhappy with the final result? Nobody wants that, and it’s crucial to remember that accepting a bad deal or even compromising is always a mistake. This is called splitting the difference, and you’ve got to avoid it at all costs. After all, every human, your counterpart included, has thoughts and needs that she won’t share or maybe isn’t even aware of. When your counterpart asks for something, you can never be sure if she actually wants it, so giving her what she asks for won’t necessarily solve the issue. Say someone is holding a politician hostage and saying that he’ll cut off her head unless he receives one million dollars. While the hostage-taker says that money is what he’s after, he might want to make a political point. If that’s true, and you give him the ransom, there’s no telling if he’ll release the hostage. For the same reason, it’s essential to take your time, even when your counterpart sets deadlines. Remember, your job is to learn about the other party and, if you’re pressed for time, chances are your judgment will be clouded. It’s important that you avoid this. It can help to remember that most deadlines are flexible and relatively random. Just take an example in which the wife of a Haitian police officer was kidnapped. The kidnappers demanded $150,000 and, following weeks of negotiation, the author saw a pattern; as Friday approached, the kidnappers would push extra hard for the ransom before laying low for the weekend. He realized that they wanted to party and, to do so, they needed money! Understanding this, the author could ascertain that the deadlines weren’t so serious and that he could negotiate a much lower price since you don’t need $150,000 to have a good time in Haiti. As in all other negotiations, patience, time and information were critical for a successful outcome. The key message in this book: By employing a few simple techniques and understanding where the other party is coming from, you can negotiate your way through just about any situation, whether it’s with your boss, your partner at home, or your local used-car dealer. The key is to stay calm and establish trust with the other person. Actionable advice: Be prepared for the extreme. In one respect, negotiation is just like war:  it’s crucial to know your enemy. That’s why you should always let your counterpart make the first offer. That being said, you should also be prepared for this initial offer to be extreme. In fact, it’s entirely normal for first offers to be far afield of your expectations. Just keep in mind that this only represents the limit for your counterpart and you can almost certainly get a much better deal.   Got feedback?

Even though we’ve been living in a giant soup of algorithms, content and data for only a few years, the time before digital connectivity now feels oddly foreign and remote. Bound up in our new world is the hazy concept of power – and even that’s changing. Technology is instigating a shift away from hierarchical old power to more democratized, accessible forms of new power. This is changing how the world behaves but also how we behave.    In order to succeed in the time of connections and crowdsourcing, you need to know how new power functions. You’ll need new tools to influence people, new systems to build crowds and new values to lead with. The following blinks shed light on all this and show you how to thrive by using some fundamental rules of power. In these blinks, you’ll find out how an epileptic woman used new power to cure herself; why spreading has replaced sticking; and why Pope Francis is an excellent new-power leader. Before the twenty-first century, society was imagined as a giant machine. People were but cogs in this machine, playing small and standardized roles. This was a golden age for colossal corporations and sprawling bureaucracies – a time when companies hoarded power as though it were currency. They made decisions for those participating in their power systems, believing they knew what was best. Such an attitude typified old power. Meanwhile, the participants in the system filled static, stereotypical roles and obeyed the system’s commands: Do your multiplication tables. Say your prayers. Buy this product. In short, chances to meaningfully participate in any role – civic, political or economic – were scarce. But times have changed. Hyperconnected technology has been a battering ram, unlocking digital doors and lowering the barriers of participating in almost any given activity. And this increase in the horizontality of power distribution is changing our behavior. For example, the logistics of organization and participation are now unconstrained by space or time. This lets, say, artists from Ireland and India collaborate together, in real time and for free. Added to that, we now have the tools to easily meet other like-minded people, lobby for change and organize resistance. And these behaviors have also altered our attitudes. We’re no longer satisfied with merely observing or agreeing; we demand a right to participate. Letitia Browne-James perfectly embodies this new attitude. A lifetime epileptic, Browne-James had all but had it with her neurologist and the ineffective medication she was prescribing. Then she stumbled across PatientsLikeMe – an online community of thousands of patients sharing experiences, recommendations and personal medical data. Through the platform, she discovered that brain surgery is an effective treatment for epilepsy. In fact, 83 percent of PatientsLikeMe users reported positive results from it. Her doctor had never discussed this option with her, so Browne-James changed physicians.   In the end, she underwent the surgery, and it’s now been five years since she’s had a seizure. By using PatientsLikeMe to take control of her health care, Browne-James used new power. So what exactly differentiates the values underlying new power from those underlying old power? Well, it’s sort of like the conflict between the worldviews of a parent and a child. The experienced, authoritative parent is always irked when their child, fresh-faced and full of idealism, attempts to influence the parenting process. By trying to change habits or question received wisdom, the child proposes new values. And the values of old power and new power clash in multiple ways. For a start, there’s a disagreement between their governing styles. Old power prefers formal and centralized governance – such as business decisions dictated from the boardroom. But new power prefers informal, networked governance – think business decisions crowdsourced among employees. Also, while old power views competitiveness as the jewel of human interaction, new power encourages cooperation and collaboration. New-power systems should reward the sharing of resources, the spreading of ideas and the remixing of original work. Their attitudes toward communication are different, too. Old power has a tendency to separate society’s public and private spheres. Here, things are on a strict need-to-know basis. Hillary Clinton illustrated this perfectly by likening politics to sausage-making: the process is unsavory – a technique the public doesn’t need to know about – but many people enjoy the end product. Clinton was trying to argue that transparent politics would be much less effective. New power rejects this view. It prefers open, transparent dealings. Items usually considered private, like a company’s salary data, are fast becoming incorporated into a right-to-know attitude. But new power isn’t only shifting value systems; it’s changing people’s roles, too. Consider the traditional “passive” consumer who is asked only to buy or use a product. This role is becoming an endangered species; its predator is the “maker” – consumers who consume and produce. Just take YouTube bloggers or citizen journalists. Thanks to accessible technologies, they’re able to create content that previously only well-funded elites could produce. And that’s not all. We’re also seeing shifts away from long-term commitment to brands toward temporary affiliation. In short, the ways people behave and associate with brands are changing. The declining number of people carrying membership cards shows this. The days of Blockbuster video store members are over. Now the new norm is drifting between online groups and using social media to temporarily associate with brands. We’re driven by impulses to opt in and later opt out. When envisaging your dream house, you probably don’t put much imaginative effort toward visualizing the foundations propping it up. Well, it’s the same with power systems; we tend to pay attention to their values, not the models they rest on. So what’s the difference between the models for old and new power? For one, new-power models cede power in a more distributed way. Consider Occupy, the protest movement fighting inequality. This is a crowd organization – a system that uses both new-power models and values. For example, it values radical transparency, equality and a meaningful role for all participants. But it also uses a highly distributed model for sharing power, opposing institutionalization and promoting local decision-making in subgroups. But this can raise issues. For instance, with Occupy’s distributed power-sharing model, it’s tough to reach any consensus or implement major organizational changes. In contrast, old-power models are built like a pyramid. A surprising example of this model is Apple. Apple is a typical castle – an organization holding old-power models and values. Yes, it’s a cutting-edge technology company, but the way it centralizes power and dictates decisions means it uses an old-power model. What’s more, Apple is notoriously secretive and dislikes brand collaborations, which aligns it with classic old-power values. But it’s not necessary to choose one power system or the other. Indeed, organizations often blend approaches, combining the models and values of both new and old power. Companies that mix old-power models with new-power values are called cheerleaders. The outdoor clothing brand Patagonia is one such company. It produces products with little external input, which is an old-power model, but collaborates with consumers by asking them to join the company in the fight against climate change and is very transparent about things like its supply chain. On the other hand, organizations that adopt old-power values and new-power models are co-opters. Facebook is a prime example. The company has built a social network based on a radical new-power model, featuring peer-to-peer networking and an interconnected infrastructure, but that doesn’t mean it holds new-power values. In fact, Facebook’s relationship with its users is very one-sided. It prevents them from suggesting or implementing major changes to the ecosystem and stockpiles your personal data like an old king hoarding treasure. How do you communicate with your target audience? It’s a question as old as business itself. Influencers and advertisers seek techniques to implant their ideas into people’s heads, but for years influencer techniques went unchanged. That’s partly because before digital communication, our main cultural influences were largely shared. Before niche online communities or specialized media, there were a few newspapers to read and/or TV channels to watch. Huge audiences were funneled into this handful of outlets, forcing advertisers to craft messages with wide appeal. In this environment, potent messages were sticky and memorable sound bites, like Nike’s “Just Do It” slogan. And to design sticky messages, the SUCCESS acronym showed the way. This was introduced by Chip and Dan Heath in their best seller Made to Stick. Here, they argued that truly sticky ideas exhibited SUCCES (altered to SUCCESS for stickiness!) – simplicity, unexpectedness, concreteness, credibility, emotions and stories. For example, sticky ideas should tell a story, taking us on a journey of sorts. But they must also be concrete, creating within us a clear mental picture. What’s more, sticky ideas should be credible, incorporating impressive statistics and expert opinions. But the goal isn’t just to make things stick anymore. New power makes ideas spread by adding ACE – which stands for actionable, connection and extensible – to SUCCESS. To spread, ideas need to be actionable. This links back to declining passive consumption. People want to be able to participate. Facebook’s “share” button is so effective because of this actionable quality. Second, spreading relies on the power of connection. To disperse properly, ideas should harness our era’s powerful online networking tools. With the help of connectivity, ideas will spread like a ripple on a lake. Finally, ideas that spread are extensible. This means they harness the creative power of a community, allowing participants to alter and remix the idea while keeping its underlying structure. Extensibility is the magic behind the spreading of memes. Maybe you remember the Ice Bucket Challenge? It was an online sensation dedicated to fundraising for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and it leveraged ACE expertly. Basically, challenge participants would drench themselves in a bucket of icy water before posting a video of it online, calling out their friends to also “take up the challenge.” The Ice Bucket Challenge was actionable because it required you to actually dump the bucket of icy water on yourself. It was connected because it utilized the social networks of participants. And it was extensible because it encouraged remixing. For example, the baseball player Pete Frates posted his challenge with Vanilla Ice’s “Ice Ice Baby” playing in the background. What use is new power if it’s hoarded by corporations like Facebook, Uber and Airbnb? Well, the truth is new power can’t be hoarded. Anyone can harness the potential of new power for their own ends, but first you need to build a crowd. This involves five steps: find, build, lower, move and harness. First, find your connected connectors: the influential, highly connected individuals who share your organization’s visions and values. Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign is a striking example of finding and nurturing connected connectors. These connectors were a mixed group of online activists who, through content creation and connection via online message boards, built a passionate base of online support for Trump. Next, you need to build a brand that embodies new power. Just take Airbnb. In 2014, the company, though riding high, was losing its sense of intimacy and beginning to look like any other faceless corporation. To tackle this, Airbnb relaunched its brand with a revamped logo designed to be remixed. Hosts could even edit Airbnb’s logo on their personal profile, adapting it to suit their style and needs. The next two steps – lower and move – are kind of like electric guitars and amplifiers. Neither are very effective alone. To start, in our world of shortening attention spans, it’s essential to lower the barriers of participation. Users demand frictionless, pain-free participation. The dating app Tinder shows how these barriers can be lowered in any scenario: the days of working up the courage to ask your crush out for dinner are over – now, you can arrange a date with just a few swipes of your thumb! Once users are participating, you need to move them up the participation scale. Think of this as a spectrum of consumer engagement. At the bottom are old-power actions, like complying or consuming. Moving up the scale, consumers become more involved – sharing, affiliating or remixing content. Finally, at the very top, we find activities only a small number will participate in: funding, producing and shaping the whole community. Often a crowd will increase incrementally, and your efforts at crowd-building will progress slowly but steadily. But this isn’t always the case. Sometimes a crowd will form in a “storm” of engagement, and you need to be ready to harness the changing weather.    Consider the Australian activist network GetUp. They created an engagement storm when Tony Abbott, the former Australian prime minister who opposed refugee rights, offered surfing lessons at a charity auction. GetUp hijacked the auction, successfully crowdfunding a winning bid for Riz Wakil, a young Afghan refugee. This creative prank caused a swarm of engagement inside GetUp’s community. They say the world is built on compromise. A situation agreeable to you is often disagreeable to others, and today’s critical business moments usually hinge on your ability to juggle the desires of essential stakeholders. In a new-power community, there are three stakeholders, all in a triangular-shaped dynamic. Topping the triangle are the platform owners. They own the infrastructure – like IP addresses and servers – and set the overarching rules. If we take Facebook, we find that Mark Zuckerberg and his company, Facebook, Inc., are the platform owners. It’s easy to think that platform owners are the community’s most important actors. But what would Facebook look like without its billions of users? These users form the second corner of our triangle. They’re the normal users, or participants, taking part in the new-power organization and contributing most to its economic value. The participants in the popular content aggregator Reddit are the users who read and vote on new content. Super-participants are just what they sound like: participants playing extremely active roles in the community. Think back to the participation scale. You’ll find super-participants nested happily in the upper echelons of this spectrum – funding, organizing and producing new content for the platform to give it unique cultural value. YouTube is particularly famous for its super-participants. Because the platform’s barrier for participation is low, it’s easy for regular participants to become super-participants through their effort and talent. Just take the Mexican beauty vlogger Yuya: At just sixteen she’d already won a YouTube-sponsored makeup contest, which inspired her to create her own channel, lady16makeup. Today, it’s the 35th most subscribed YouTube channel in the world! So, we know the key actors of a new-power community – but why the triangle? Well, it’s crucial for a new-power community to balance each key actor’s interests, and these can often fall into conflict. YouTube’s Partner Program is a shining example of a platform that nurtures its super-participants. It supports its content creators by sharing 55 percent of their video’s advertising revenue. It’s a win-win for YouTube, satisfying super-participants and incentivizing great new content. If a platform is trying to engage its participants more, a great way of showing they’re valued is introducing a recognition system where they are rated on their contributions. Examples like Reddit’s “karma” system or eBay’s “power-seller” program make users feel validated and respected. Like the sun, the key actor triangle doesn’t float aimlessly in a vacuum devoid of context or environment. Instead, it’s orbited by a host of secondary actors, influencing the triangle’s dynamic and the organization’s fate in general. This means that maintaining a well-balanced triangle isn’t enough to create a successful new-power community. You must also cultivate a small ensemble of other players and partners. These include institutional funders, the media, NGOs, celebrities or influencers and the general public. Consider Invisible Children, the humanitarian organization behind the video Kony 2012. A YouTube sensation pushing for the capture of Joseph Kony, the Ugandan warlord, Kony 2012 was dubbed “the most viral video in the world.” But the response to the video was mostly negative. Invisible Children was criticized for uneducated activism. Its website crashed and critics questioned its financial structure. Before this, the organization had a perfectly aligned triangle. It cultivated super-participants with training programs, decentralized power to local organizers and supported the participants sharing its content. Unfortunately, Kony 2012 bypassed this model to seek rapid international fame. In particular, Invisible Children failed to cultivate outside influencers orbiting its triangle, like celebrities and academic critics. This lapse turned into a black hole, which swallowed up Invisible Children’s reputation. So, how do new-power organizations balance their triangle and keep a steady orbit? Through the participation premium. Think about old-power models based on basic economic transactions – things like purchasing a camera. Today, to be truly successful, organizations need to provide users with both a product or service and a higher purpose. Combining these elements gives us the participation premium. This can be seen in a range of different contexts. Consider the “IKEA effect,” a term coined by the behavioral economists Michael Norton, Daniel Mochon and Dan Ariely. It’s the idea that people participating in a project, or contributing toward a goal, place a higher value on the finished product than its objective worth. This effect is so named because the researchers observed subjects overvaluing furniture they assembled themselves. The Chinese smartphone brand Xiaomi is a company known for its high participation premium. Every single week the manufacturers launch a new version of their user interface, asking users to review it. In turn, customers feel as though they’re a valuable part of the development process and therefore contributing to a higher purpose. Old power and new power are colliding in our current world. The leaders that stand out are embracing old techniques, but harnessing three new leadership tools: signaling, structuring and shaping. Pope Francis, for instance, is a startling new-power leader. He uses his unorthodox actions – like washing a refugee’s feet – to demonstrate personal values to subordinates within his ultratraditional organization. These actions signal desirable behaviors to adherents. Pope Francis is also an example of leadership by structuring. He has tried – say, through his reforms to the Vatican Bank – to use his leadership as a restructuring process. By decentralizing power, he is revamping the church’s power dynamic and flipping the old-power pyramid, where power flows from the top down, into an inverted pyramid, where power flows from the bottom up. Also, look no further than the pope for examples of shaping. Shaping is a way of influencing the general direction of an organization, subtly molding the beliefs and attitudes of your followers and subconsciously changing the rules of the game. Pope Francis famously encapsulated the shaping leadership style when, during a flight from Brazil, a journalist asked him for his views on homosexuality. His simple reply? “Who am I to judge?” The key difference between shaping and structuring is that the former is a subtle but active process of reform, while the latter is a passive “lead by example”-tactic. But old-power leadership is far from dead – and blending both leadership styles may be the key to succeeding in this transitory time. Consider Podemos, Spain’s progressive political party. Dissatisfied with the domestic political climate, founder Pablo Iglesias launched the party, surprisingly enough, with an old-power tactic: a TV show. This might seem an odd choice, but Iglesias was using the show to get plenty of airtime from traditional news outlets, from which he gained a large following for his charismatic speaking skills. Initially, the focus was on his charming personality and not his new political movement, seemingly like an old power “top-down” organization. But when Podemos subsequently became an official party, it was launched with a wealth of new-power values. For example, Podemos’s manifesto championed “horizontality and transparency,” even putting the existence of the whole party to a popular vote. It continued to retain the charismatic leadership of Iglesias, but the party began using revolutionary democratic methods, such as crowdsourcing its policies. Blending powerful, charismatic leaders with new-power values, Podemos is a stellar example of a hybrid new power–old power leadership model. The key message in these blinks: Digital connectivity has changed our era’s power dynamics. Old power, with its centralized top-down hierarchy, is being replaced with a bottom-up new-power system that prizes decentralization, collaboration and transparent execution. These systems have different models and values, but it’s not simply a case of “new power = good; old power = bad.” Both have merits and disadvantages. And although they can be blended, new power offers a fresh set of tools for building crowds, spreading ideas and leading organizations. Got feedback?

For decades, customers loved what you offered and recognized your brand from a mile away. Then all of a sudden competitors have outflanked you – a hungry new rival could even make everything you offer redundant. What are you going to do?  Well, you can either wait on the sidelines and hope to find a new market, or you can act radically. In all likelihood, you’ll need to do the latter – stop treading water and start swimming. In the following blinks, we’ll look at how established companies can install a permanent growth mind-set at the heart of their operations by acting more like start-ups. Even creaky fifty-year-old organizations can learn to move with the freshness and agility of first-time entrepreneurs. In these blinks, you’ll learn when American capitalism began to rot from the inside; why Microsoft’s new CEO had to reinvent the organization; and how Bubble Wrap was invented. Let’s go back in time to the dawn of American capitalism. In the late nineteenth century – the days of the Rockefellers and Carnegies, of venerable mustaches and top hats – big business behaved itself. These were civic-minded, patriotic enterprises, which served customers and country. Businesses looked to provide a reliable product – say, good whiskey or a trusty tricycle – and preserve a connection with the consumers who bought their goods. Then, in the middle of the twentieth century, something changed. By the 1960s, American mega-corporations were focusing on accumulating profit rather than serving consumers’ needs. By this time, they were now more concerned with paying corporate executives massive sums than with fixing customer problems. The economist John Kenneth Galbraith diagnosed this situation in his book The New Industrial State, which claimed that big corporations raked in enormous profits at the expense of the betterment of society. In response to this book, two economists, Michael C.  Jensen and William H. Meckling, published an influential paper titled “Theory of the Firm: Managerial Behaviour, Agency Costs and Ownership Structure.” They also railed against the state of American capitalism. But rather than encouraging corporations to serve customers better, they told them to look after their shareholders. Shareholders, who had been the lowest priority, were growing disgruntled when business suffered a dip in the late 1960s. Worried that their discontent could blow up the economy, many businesses took the advice of Jensen and Meckling and decided that they would prioritize shareholders above all else. The shift to gratifying shareholders meant that business became completely detached from public or consumer needs. Many businesses became obsessed with shareholder appeasement, and abandoned any activity that didn’t boost stock prices. This meant that, naturally, rather than investing capital into developing that new car, computer or fashion line, businesses focused on cutting expenditures. The more efficient they became, the better the ratios were for shareholders. There’s a great metaphor to illustrate what happened next. Picture a small mother-bird with a huge cuckoo chick in her nest. She forgets her own chicks, choosing to feed only the cuckoo, which grows ever more enormous. Similarly, businesses that once looked to serve their customers and grow their enterprises became consumed with tending to their shareholders. Consequently, they stopped innovating and stopped growing. If a great white shark stops swimming, oxygen can’t pass through its gills, so it sinks and dies. When they stop innovating, big businesses tend to do the same. Stasis leads to a gradual – or sometimes, steep – decline. Modern start-ups understand this, so many foster a very different mind-set to long-established companies. Unlike established businesses obsessed with shareholder returns, start-ups look to provide new solutions to customer problems. They seek to identify a “pain point” or “friction point” for consumers. Think of the social media giant, Facebook. Back when it was cooked up in Mark Zuckerberg’s dormitory room, he foresaw a pain point. He sensed that many people – far beyond the Ivy League colleges where Facebook was initially tested – would love to keep in contact with family members and friends, to share photographs and stories across the world. We all know what happened next – Facebook grew to become one of the world’s most successful enterprises. Or consider the food-delivery service, Deliveroo. In this case, the pain point was the lack of delivery options for restaurant cuisine. In fact, Deliveroo’s founder, Will Shu, discovered this pain point himself while working late nights in Morgan Stanley’s London office. Rather than incremental tinkering, start-up culture encourages innovation that leads to long-term growth. Rather than simply tweaking existing products and improving proven processes, the start-up mind-set means embracing risk and facing the future. Although it sounds counterintuitive, in today’s fast-paced commercial climate, this is also the only way that a company can achieve sustainable growth. By continuing to seek solutions for endless customer problems, companies with a start-up mind-set can grow. If we look at the top five companies according to market capitalization in 2018 – Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Facebook – we see a common thread. All of those companies have adopted this start-up mind-set, and all continue to innovate and seek new customer solutions. What we’ve outlined here is the New to Big philosophy – the key to taking an idea with potential and letting it grow exponentially. In the next blink, we’ll learn how one established company adopted some of these strategies to save itself. Microsoft is a corporate powerhouse. As we learned in the last blink, in 2018, it was one of the top five companies according to market capitalization. It was on this list back in 2001, too, alongside General Electric, ExxonMobil, Citigroup and Walmart. Between 2001 and 2018, however, Microsoft dropped out of the top five. What happened? Microsoft lost its spark when Bill Gates stepped down as CEO in 2000. When the next CEO Steve Ballmer took over, rather than continuing the world-changing work of the founder, he applied a staid, incrementalist logic. While other tech firms were racing ahead and breaking new ground (notably, Google and Apple), Microsoft offered a series of drab products that imitated others, rather than stamping their individuality on the world. Then, in 2014, a new CEO was appointed who turned things around. This was Satya Nadella, who approached his job at Microsoft – a 44-year-old company with a rich legacy – as if he was taking the reins at a new start-up. He approached his role with a completely new mind-set, which he articulated in an interview in 2015. “We no longer talk about lagging indicators of success – revenue, profit. What are the leading indicators of success? Customer love.” In his book, Hit Refresh: The Quest to Rediscover Microsoft’s Soul and Imagine a Better Future for Everyone, Nadella sets out his philosophy, which entails promoting bold new ideas, making space for employees to experiment and fail and keeping an eye on the long view, rather than worrying about quarterly returns. Nadella has successfully shaped Microsoft into a kind of hybrid, where all the resources, capital and brand-recognition of a corporate behemoth meet entrepreneurial risk-taking. Now, with a double-digit profit margin growth every quarter, it’s clear that his tactics are paying off. You could say that Nadella has refounded Microsoft. So, what can we learn from Microsoft’s story? Not just that we can reinvent established companies, but that it’s positively necessary for their survival. In the same way that we should meet new challenges throughout our lives to remain agile, big companies must keep moving to keep their vitality.   What’s the difference between the dinosaurs of the corporate world and their hungry new challengers? A different mind-set, which runs from top to bottom. This is the difference between the Total Addressable Market model and the Total Addressable Problem model. Let’s begin with the Total Addressable Market, or TAM, model. This framework has been used for decades – it’s the main religion of the corporate world. Established companies are hardwired to use it. It addresses the problem of how big a market is, and how big a share of that market the business can reasonably expect to command. It works with what is knowable and battles competitors for a market share, modifying their existing products or services only. Rather than prioritizing new customer pain points, they focus mostly on their own – like stock prices and short-term financial success. And as we’ve seen, businesses that follow this approach in today’s world can begin to stagnate. In the worst circumstances, they can become obsolete. Of course, the TAM model isn’t completely misguided. If you’re in the lipstick business and you want to manufacture a new lip-gloss, you could use the TAM model to estimate how big a market you could reasonably expect to conquer. But, beyond that, it loses its authority. It’s like exploring the flora of a new planet with a guidebook from earth. By contrast, the Total Addressable Problem model is the way to achieve exponential growth. Because the TAP model is based on discovering brand-new customer problems or needs, it can uncover new markets. It is the untouched markets that will lead to growth, rather than those with lots of competition already.  Take the mobile phone. When it first came on the market, it was a bulky device aimed almost exclusively at high-powered executives. The Total Addressable Problem area seemed small. But as they became lighter, smaller and more affordable, demand blew up. Electronics designers had sensed that mobiles were addressing a far larger problem – mobile communication for everyone. This was the untouched market that would yield enormous returns for the first mobile phone manufacturers. Now that we’ve moved to the TAP model, we need to think differently about all aspects of doing business. That starts with anticipating what customers want. Rather than simply tweaking an existing product or idea to better suit the customer, those with a growth mind-set need to begin from where the customers are. In other words, you need to look at what customers actually do, rather than what they say they’ll do. Take the voice of the customer approach, where companies encourage customers to give feedback. Often what happens is that customers are socialized to give the answers they think they should provide. Say a leading tech firm is conducting research for a new app that locates nearby fine-dining opportunities. In their market research, they ask people what they think of the app and how much they’d spend on it. A good number of potential customers reportedly like the app and would spend $15 a month to use it.  A company approaching this in the old way, with a TAM mind-set, would report that the app received a “positive response” and that customers “would spend $15.” A company with a growth mind-set would finish their market research with another question – “Will you commit to signing up for it now?” If the answer to that is equivocal or negative, they’d report that the app probably doesn’t present such a great opportunity. You need to be ready to dump your idea and begin anew if customer research takes you elsewhere. Let’s say you’re a company that makes chewable candy and you’re looking to make a new product, but are aware that processed sugar is viewed negatively. In this case, you’d try to understand your customers and how they really feel. You find that both your die-hard fans and occasional purchasers associate eating your snack with “treating themselves.” So rather than the new sugar-free chewable candy idea that you started with, you’re now in the business of “treats.” Then, rather than manufacturing chewable candy, you can think of other ways that people like to “treat themselves,” like carob snacks, makeup or succulent houseplants. What’s the lesson here? Rather than acting like the focus-group researchers of yesteryear, you need to be a dynamic, flexible observer. Every email sent by the venture capitalist Esther Dyson comes with a footer that reads, “Always make new mistakes!” What does she mean by this? Let’s have a look. The results of productive failure are all around us. Take the lubricant, WD-40. Guess why there’s the number “40” after “WD” (which stands for Water Displacement). That’s right – it took 40 attempts before the company perfected the formula. Or consider Bubble Wrap. It was initially conceived as a futuristic, trendy textured wallpaper. It bombed, and only became a success when the company IBM used it to wrap computer parts for transport. Without this accident, it was destined for the landfill. But, much to its detriment, executive culture is afraid of admitting mistakes. Established companies don’t like failure – it’s not the way they’re wired. The executives who run them are highly competitive people who like winning. The valuable learning process of failure is alien to them. This influences everyone at the company who’d rather tiptoe around the leadership than voice their misgivings about the company’s direction. So, rather than making small mistakes from which the company could learn crucial lessons, a doomed project could be kept alive for too long, leading to a huge waste of money and company time. It’s important, then, to encourage productive failure. If you’re a big company and you wish to create an environment in which employees can experiment and fail interestingly, then you need to create an atmosphere in which it is acceptable to do so. This means allowing for lots of small, fast and cheap failures from which innovators can learn. It also means encouraging leaders to kill off doomed projects and for subordinates and confront their superiors with the truth. Failure is intrinsic to innovation. In the next blink, we’ll look at how companies can create a structure that incorporates this innovation. If you’re a business leader at a TAM-oriented company who wants to switch to a TAP mind-set, you’ll need a great team to make it happen. You’ll likely have the employees you need in your organization already. However, the people who’ve succeeded at your company may not be ready for the challenge of innovative entrepreneurialism. These high-performers will probably think according to the way big companies usually operate – which, as we’ve already seen, is incrementalist and risk-averse. Instead, seek out the iconoclasts, free-thinkers and contrarians. These individuals may have been passed over for promotion in the past because they’re considered “interesting” misfits, rather than smooth operators. There are important traits you can look for to narrow down potential recruits. First of all, they should be adaptable. They need to figure out what to do when tried-and-tested processes and ideas don’t work. For instance, if a project leads them into radically different terrain from where they began, they can change direction without breaking stride. Remember the chewable candy example we looked at earlier? The company junked candy altogether and decided it would move into marketing a “treat” – that is what adaptability means.   High on the list of necessary characteristics is curiosity. In other words, they should be able to detect patterns between what look like disparate or unrelated sources and trends and build innovative business ideas from them. They should also be humble. One important aspect of innovative entrepreneurialism is the ability to work collaboratively. This isn’t about the egotistical individual – it’s about what individuals can achieve together as a team. Finally, they should be passionate about experimentation. This is the superpower – the potential candidate must be a relentless experimenter. They should be something of a mad scientist, absolutely determined to crack the code. In our final blink, we’ll look at how to finance these wild ideas in a way that doesn’t spell disaster for a company. If you don’t buy a ticket, you can’t win the lottery. When investing in new business ideas, it’s a bit more complicated than this. However, the notion of risk is the same, and you can increase your chances of success by following a few of the following ideas.  Firstly, companies need to make it easier to secure permission to invest in new ideas. Though risk-taking isn’t limited to disruptive new start-ups, it can be tricky to get permission to try new ideas at long-standing companies used to refining their existing business model. This is often because budgets are allocated annually, and the process of securing funding can be incredibly bureaucratic and cumbersome. In fact, many new ideas die before they even pass under the nose of senior leadership.  One way to make it easier for funding to flow into new ideas is to install a Growth Board. A Growth Board is a small team at the top of the company. This team quickly judges the merits of new ideas, allocates funding and monitors the development of each scheme. But rather than allocating a large amount of funding all at once – as is often the case in established companies with an inflexible budgeting process – they should invest small amounts at the beginning of each project.  Then, as the project unfolds, more funding can be allocated if it succeeds. At each step, funding can either be awarded or withdrawn – this process instills the kind of combativeness and urgency that all start-ups face. And, importantly, this step-by-step process means that the whole venture can be “de-risked.” If the idea is flagging, the Growth Board can simply withdraw funding at an early stage.   And because most new business ideas fail, it’s best to invest in many at once. The great thing about the Growth Board model is that established companies can keep many different pots on the boil at once. Just like investments in the stock market, the majority of new business ideas aren’t successful. They can be interesting and useful failures, but not viable. But companies significantly increase their chances of hitting on one of those golden ideas – like Uber or Airbnb – if they hedge their bets. With this setup, a company can take risks and innovate. This is called the always-on mind-set – and the results can be incredible The key message in these blinks: Big companies seeking growth must act with the dynamism and flexibility of new start-ups. Otherwise, they face stagnation and obsolescence. The key to growth is to provide new solutions to customer pain points, which can be ascertained by an attentive approach to market research. To introduce this growth model into a big organization, a special team of maverick innovators must be employed.  Actionable advice:  Read outside of your comfort zone. If you’re an executive or corporate type, don’t just read books by other executives and business minds. Read art theory, philosophy and good novels. You might just find that the imaginative truths in works far removed from your own sphere inspire you to develop new commercial ideas.   Got feedback?

What to read next: The Innovator’s Dilemma by Clayton M. Christensen You’re now familiar with the challenges that big corporations face if they don’t learn to innovate quickly. Just because they have a solid legacy and good management practices, they might still be at risk of falling into serious stagnation. Through historical examples, Clayton M. Christensen explains why it’s the companies that seem to be doing everything right – good management culture, an established brand – that are suddenly blindsided by disruptive technologies. But not only can they survive in the face of these innovations, they can actually harness them to their own advantage.

Despite what conventional wisdom might say, there are no specific personality traits that all leaders need to have. There’s no particular talent or aptitude that they always exhibit early on in their careers. And there are no special universities that you have to attend in order to become a leader. Just like any skill, leadership is a muscle that can be strengthened by constant practice. Combine that practice with a bit of management theory, and you’re on the road to becoming a leader. As you’ll see in the blinks that follow, the philosophy behind effective leadership doesn’t involve any bullshit, gimmicks or mind games; instead, it involves a few basic principles that anyone can harness for the purpose of effectively leading a team. Who knows – after finishing these blinks, you might realize that you’ve been a leader this whole time without even knowing it! In these blinks, you’ll discover what Colin Powell’s 40/70 rule is; how General Electric CEO Jack Welsh decided which employees he had to let go; and why diversity helps drive highly effective teams. No matter the context, being appointed to a leadership position can be daunting. Whether you’ve just been asked to coach a little league team or you’ve been promoted to an executive role at your company, leadership comes in all shapes and sizes. But no matter how big the team of people you lead is – or how high the stakes are – the challenges behind leadership remain the same. Indeed, the biggest challenge of being a leader is, well, leading. That means steering a ship full of people all the way to its destination, no matter how rough the waters get after you depart. Luckily, there are two questions that can help guide you on the journey. The first is: Where are you and your organization at right now? What challenges are you currently facing? To figure this out, the best thing you can do as a leader is to listen, and the best people to listen to are front-line, customer-facing employees. After all, they’re directly aware of the issues your customers are experiencing. Whether they’re cashiers, salespeople or customer support agents, their insights will be infinitely more valuable than any expensive outside consultant coming in to diagnose your organization’s woes. There are a number of ways you can go about gathering these insights; you could try anonymous methods such as an online survey, for example. But if you want to be effective, you need a more intimate approach, like BBC Radio 1’s “pizza meetings,” where people from all over the company come together for free pizza – and to share insights on the company’s issues. Now that you know where your company is, you’re ready to ask the second question: Where do you want to go? At this point, don’t get stuck in vague mission statements or coming up with a “vision” – these are time-wasting, bullshit approaches to leadership. Take the English rugby team’s loss during the first round at the 2015 Rugby World Cup. In the wake of this disastrous defeat, they hired a new head coach – Eddie Jones. Jones found himself asking the two leadership questions. He knew where his team was at – embarrassed and defeated. And where did the team want to go? They wanted to win the next World Cup in 2019. Instead of hand-wringing, Jones immediately moved the team onto working toward that goal. And it’s as easy as that. No consultants, no visions, no mission statements and no bullshit. Just leading. Now that you know where you are and where you want to go, it’s time to figure out how you’re going to navigate the rough seas between the start and end points of your voyage. But leadership is about doing, not talking about it. So avoid endless hours of pointless meetings where different strategies are discussed. As captain, you’re not going to be predicting the weather based on complex environmental science; you can leave that to the meteorologists. Your job is to sail the ship – in other words, to get stuff done. Now, simply executing decisions is often easier than it sounds; deciding between different courses of action can be a daunting task, particularly when the risk of failure is high. So how do you know which decision is the right one to take? The truth of the matter is that whether a decision is right or wrong can only be assessed after a decision has been made and its resulting action is executed. In fact, there is only one clearly wrong decision when it comes to making a decision – not making a decision at all.So if taking action is itself the only way to go, employ a useful tool that’ll give your decisions a greater chance of success – the 40/70 rule, created by former US Secretary of State Colin Powell. It’s basically this: you should only execute a decision if you’re sure that it has a 40 percent chance of success. But once you feel that the chances of success are 70 percent, you know that you’ve spent too much time ruminating over it. Effective decision-making means striking while the iron is hot. Weighing the options is great, but only up to a point. After all, a bad decision as a leader won’t affect just you, but all the other individuals that are accompanying you on this voyage that you’re the captain of. All in all, leaders make mistakes. But as long as 51 percent of the decisions you make lead to good results, you’re ahead of the game. What’s more, even if 49 percent of the decisions you make are bad ones, the lessons you’ll learn from them over time will decrease the likelihood of you repeating poor decisions in the future. The cultural aspect of any organization is extremely important, as it defines the ways in which team members act both as individuals and in groups. But while many businesses define their company cultures with elaborate mission statements and lists of “values,” these don’t necessarily have anything to do with the way a company actually functions. For your organization to avoid this fate, you’ll need to foster a cultural shift through actions, not words, and the best way to do this is by setting an example. That’s crucial, because the culture you want to create is one where decision-making thrives at all levels of your organization – and if you as a leader are a person of action, then everyone else is likely to follow suit. But this is often easier said than done. Culture, in many ways, is like concrete. While concrete is easy to shape when wet, once it sets, it’s impossible to manipulate. If your organization’s culture is littered with unhealthy elements, such as petty rivalries and top-down hierarchies where no one feels empowered to make decisions, you’ll need to smash the concrete and start over. And that decisive action is the first of many that will inspire others to start taking decision-making into their own hands as well. One way to smash the concrete of an unhealthy company culture is to modify the physical environment where your people work. This can be as simple as changing where your teams meet or holding meetings on sofas, instead of around a table. Even just altering your workplace’s seating plans can have a powerful effect, especially if you get rid of corner offices and other signs of hierarchy. These physical changes may seem trivial, but they are imperative to shaking off bad habits that have developed in a company’s culture. Sure, they aren’t enough to transform your business overnight, but they’ll create space for you to implement a new and improved company culture. This is precisely what happened when the author became CEO of a major company. After smashing the concrete, he launched a new culture initiative based around one word: “open.” No longer were managers required to sign off on work – instead, they were re-framed as mentors who led by example, not by rank. Departments were done away with, as well as seating plans that indicated rank or job title. Instead, teams became flexible, working in proximity to those that they shared tasks with. While adopting an open organizational culture may be the best way to achieve your goals as a leader, any cultural shift will be less effective if you don’t have the right people on your team. This is why it’s necessary to broach the taboo topic of removing people from your team who are getting in the way of your organization’s success. Luckily, ex-CEO of GE Jack Welsh came up with two questions that will help you determine who is holding you back: First, does an employee fit in with the culture of your organization? And second, does he deliver results? If the answer is yes to both questions, then this person is obviously a great fit. And it’s equally clear that those who don’t get your culture and don’t deliver need to be let go. But what about employees who get your company’s culture but don’t deliver? These people need to be retained, since culture is paramount – but they should be assigned to a coach so that they can improve their performance. It’s trickier, however, to know what to do with those who deliver but don’t fit in with the culture you’re trying to establish. Countless leaders have fretted over cases like this, but Welsh, who has decades of experience, believes that these employees actually restrict the growth of the cultures within their teams and hamper their organizations in the long term. As such, he recommends that they be let go. But what about bringing new team members on board? The short answer here is that diversity always wins. You’ll need a mix of dependable professionals and unpredictable mavericks. Think of a football team, with their reliable defenders and maverick playmakers. If the whole team was playing defense the whole time, they would have much lower chances of getting anywhere. Sure, homogenous teams of dependable people are easier to lead, but they’re also less likely to take ownership and make quick decisions. In contrast, ambitious, eclectic team members help create a group that thrives on radical decision-making. But the importance of diversity also extends beyond personality types. According to a 2015 McKinsey report, public companies with the highest amounts of ethnic and racial diversity on their teams are more profitable than their competitors. In fact, the most diverse quarter of public companies were 35 percent more likely to earn more than the industry average. Multicultural teams mean that everyone has something special to bring to the table, and this will undoubtedly help your organization – and culture – thrive. In many ways, leading is akin to hill-climbing. As a leader, it’s your job to convince your team that a hill is worth climbing; then, once you’ve reached the summit, you have to be able to point out yet another hill in the distance that the team will be climbing next. Along the way, some of the team may stumble and fall face-first into the ground, but it’s your job as a leader to get them back on their feet again. As you plow through the peaks and troughs of the journey, times will undoubtedly get tough. But when this happens, it’s more crucial than ever that a leader keeps radiating the kind of energy and resilience that will inspire those who follow.   After all, if you set a bad example, others will follow that too. Say, for instance, that after a terrible day, you sit down at your desk and place your head in your hands. When your team sees you in such a distressed state, it won’t in any way incentivize them to keep up their own hard work. In other words, if you appear distressed, they’ll feel distressed. Now, in most cases, radiating a positive attitude will be just as influential. But others’ attitudes can have a big effect too, and all it takes is the bad attitude of one team member to demotivate and drain the energy of a whole team. Imagine this situation: you and your team are working late to prepare for an important pitch the next morning, but energy levels are falling rapidly. Then a team member – let’s call him Ryan – starts complaining about having to work so late, and the morale of the rest of the team collapses. It’s in moments like this that the wisdom of Jack Welsh becomes so apparent. When shit is about to hit the fan and deadlines are fast approaching, that’s when your true colors show, regardless of whether you’re a leader or a follower. Ryan might do good work most of the time, but his unhealthy attitude doesn’t fit the culture you’re trying to develop, and his behavior will drain the energy from the rest of your team. Today’s world is one of constant disruptions. Whole industries are being shuttered, and ancient corporate behemoths are getting replaced by innovative competitors. But while many companies have fallen victim to the transformational changes occurring around us, some have weathered the storm and come out on top. Such success stories hinge on successful change management, where new leaders come in to failing companies and attempt to turn things around. The author has over ten years of experience doing just this, and he has identified a number of strategies that leaders can employ when trying to fix broken businesses. The very first task any change leader should engage in is running a simple reception test. Body language and appearance can reveal a lot about people, including the inner emotions that they're trying to keep hidden. So change leaders need to observe their new team members closely to accurately gauge their situation. Do people maintain eye contact while holding a conversation? Do they care about their appearance? Taken together, these impressions of individuals will likely tell you a lot about the business as a whole. But the reception test takes its name from perhaps the biggest giveaway of all: an untidy, cluttered reception area. When organizations become used to mediocrity, a professional reception is usually the first thing to go. And cleaning that area up and making it cosmetically appealing can help team members quickly feel a little more proud of their place of work. The next aspect of fixing broken businesses is to identify five allies that you can join forces with. This should be a mix of people who already know their way around the organization and outsiders with experience in change management. Together with this new core team, you can define short- and long-term organizational objectives. Once this is done, they will act as evangelists for the change you’re hoping to bring to the company, making sure that everyone is aware of where it’s all heading. But perhaps most importantly, being a successful change leader is about preparing to dig in your heels for the long term. Nothing worthwhile is ever easy, and raising broken businesses from the ashes is no exception. As the saying goes, Rome wasn’t built in a day. Rebuilding organizations is no different. So hang in there, stay resilient, and make sure that you keep radiating leadership so that your new followers remain inspired. The key message in these blinks: No-bullshit leadership is all about keeping things simple. Throw out your mission statements and lists of “values,” and get down to the core of leadership: leading. In other words, your job is to take your people from point A and get them to point B. You and your team will definitely run into hurdles along the way, but it’s your job as a leader to keep your team marching forward, no matter what happens. Once you’ve learned to harness the power of no-bullshit leadership, you’ll even be able to take the most broken of organizations and lead them out of the valley of the shadow of death – and on toward a brighter tomorrow.  Actionable advice: Don’t forget to make time for downtime. It doesn’t matter where you’re at on your quest toward better leadership – downtime is a must. Even the most high-energy leaders out there need to take regular breaks in order to avoid burnout. After all, if leaders can’t lead a balanced life themselves, how on Earth are they meant to lead a team of others? Exhaustion won’t do a thing to help you energize your team. One mindset you can use to make sure you’re always making enough time for yourself is to treat yourself as the most important member of your team. Sure, there’s no “i” in team, but there’s also no team without a leader. So don’t be afraid to be selfish sometimes. You’re no good to your team if you’re not good to yourself. Got feedback?

In other words, any activity that you can do well time and time again, while also enjoying yourself, is a strength. It’s no surprise that organizations where employees are able to use their strengths every day are successful and sustainable. The Gallup Organization asked 198,000 employees across different businesses whether they’re able to do what they do best at work each day.  The 20 percent of employees that strongly agreed with the question were 50 percent more likely to work in organizations with lower employee turnover, 38 percent more likely to work in more productive businesses and 44 percent more likely to work for companies with higher customer satisfaction.  Despite this, many organizations still waste time, money and resources by concentrating on fixing employee weaknesses. Think about it: employees get sent off to special training programs not to expand on their strengths, but to correct weaknesses. By focusing on damage control rather than development, the true potential of employees is neglected.  Of course, damage control is sometimes necessary; a clever but inarticulate employee would benefit greatly from a communication class. Still, damage control should not be the focal point of employee management. If you want your employees to develop and grow, and your company to grow with them, you need a different approach.  Everyone loves to do things they’re good at. But why are we good at these things in the first place? We often hear that practice makes perfect – but that’s not quite true! You’ve built up the strengths you have because you started off with a natural talent.  Talents are patterns of thought and behavior that make some things easier for you. You might, for example, be great at connecting with strangers. That’s a talent! Others don’t find socializing so easy. Either way, we can’t alter this predisposition.  But what we can do is take a predisposition we like and develop it. Developing your strengths entails refining your talent with knowledge and skills.  Knowledge can be factual or experiential. If you’re learning to play the piano, you’ll have to retain a certain amount of factual knowledge, such as by learning different musical notations. But you’ll also acquire knowledge through the experiences of practicing, performing and listening. As you gather experiential knowledge, you also start building up skills. These are the key aspects of your chosen activity that will improve your performance. So, if you’re an experienced public speaker, you’ll have become skilled at catching and holding the attention of your audience. Developing your strengths is a long-term process, and being specific about the skills you have will help you identify exactly where your strengths lie. By way of comparison, think about how diverse the language of human flaws is. Neurosis, psychosis, mania, perfectionism, depression, anxiety – the labels for human difficulties are plentiful and precise. Strangely enough, the language for human strengths is incredibly limited. Human Resources professionals are known to choose candidates based on their “people skills.” Yet, two people with people skills could consist of one person that is great at building trust in long-term relationships, while the other is great at facilitating conversations. It’s time we give talents the close-up attention they deserve. In the next blink, we’ll dive into one particularly important question: how are talents created? In the previous blink, we learned that a talent is a pattern of thought or behavior, and that we naturally possess some patterns but not others. But why is that? To find out, we can take a closer look at the neuroscience behind the development of talents.  Up until the age of three, our brains possess a hundred billion neurons that are capable of making around fifteen thousand connections between synapses. These synaptic connections allow brain cells to communicate with each other – which is a lot of communication! Does this mean we all had the brain of a potential genius as toddlers? Not quite. For our brains and our intelligence to really develop, we had to lose a significant portion of synaptic connections. By the time we turn 15, billions of these connections are wiped out permanently. But it’s actually a good thing: with fewer synaptic connections, sensory overload is prevented and specific connections can be reinforced.  Some connections become much stronger than others, and these are the connections that allow us to perform certain actions with greater proficiency. This explains why certain movements, responses or activities come to you naturally, while others will always feel uncomfortable.  In order to improve certain connections, we need to practice them so that they’re strong enough to overtake the connections that cause behavior we don’t want.  But, of course, this isn’t always possible. If you’ve ever worked on your ability to stay calm in an argument, you might find that your short-tempered reactions still take over. All that practice to help you reflect, maintain eye contact or keep an open and accepting attitude go right out the window!  Take a look at all the people around you. Whether you’re on the train or in your workplace, you’re surrounded by people who possess strengths. Unfortunately, many strengths go to waste when talents remain undetected.  Discovering talents is a crucial task. We’re actually presented with numerous opportunities to uncover talents in our daily lives. But if you want to find talent where you least expect it, start by observing your spontaneous reactions.  Say you’re attending an event where you don’t know too many people. If you hang back and chat to people you’re already acquainted with, you might have a talent for reinforcing existing relationships. If you dive into the crowd and start making friends with strangers, you might have a talent for winning people over.  Or, imagine one of your employees informs you that he can’t come to work because his child is sick. If you automatically asked about the child, this might be a sign that you’ve got a natural ability for empathy. On the other hand, if you immediately thought about who could potentially fill in for your employee, you might have a talent for rapid problem solving.  When examining your instinctive reactions, it helps to understand the two different indicators for different kinds of talent: yearnings and rapid learning.   Yearnings reveal the talents that appear early on in our lives. Mozart was only 12 years old when he wrote his first symphony! If you had a burning interest in as a child, why not explore it further? You may find a hidden talent there. Rapid learning is another way to spot talent. When you pick up a new skill, how fast do you learn the ropes? If you master something in record time, there’s a good chance that a natural talent is calling out to you. Believe it or not, Henri Matisse only began painting by chance. He started off with a basic manual to painting as his guide, and was accepted to Paris’s most prestigious art school just four years later!  Now that we’ve explored the origins and signs of natural talents, it’s time for you to start seeking them out in your employees. By uncovering their strengths, you’ll help them and your organization achieve top performance and productivity.  In the second blink, we learned that it was important to be specific when describing talents. This is particularly important in the workplace, where different roles have diverse requirements. There are at least 34 types of talents relevant to organizations, so let’s look at a few that might already exist in your workplace.  Do you have an analytical employee? He’s the one that challenges others, argues objectively and believes that data reveals the truth. He likes to back up his claims with logical thinking, and expects the same of others. This is something to remember when giving instructions to an analytical employee: keep them as detailed, clear and sensible as possible.  Or perhaps you’ve discovered that one of your employees is a commander. She’s rather skilled at convincing others to take her side in a conflict, and is always ready to share her opinion. She’s determined and won’t back down from confrontation when looking for solutions.  Managers can rely on commanding types for insights about what’s going on within workplace relations. But if they start overpowering quieter employees or ignoring commitments, you’ll need to meet them head-on and back up your claims with concrete examples.  Another employee of yours might be a restorative type. He likes solving problems and is always there to lift spirits when things seem hopeless. There’s no challenge for which he can’t tease out a solution, which makes him great for positions in customer relations. Managers can turn to restorative types for help and expect a focused, reassuring response.  The key message in this book: It’s time we stopped focusing on correcting weaknesses and started recognizing and developing our strengths. If you give yourself a chance and know what to look out for, you’ll see natural talent jump out at you. These talents can be combined with skills and knowledge to bring powerful strengths to life.  Suggested further reading: First, Break all the Rules by Marcus Buckingham and Curt Coffman The book shows how great management differs from conventional approaches. The authors demonstrate how some commonly held notions about career and management are actually misleading.

From King Xerxes of Persia and Rome’s Emperor Augustus to Lincoln and FDR, some of these leaders showed remarkable foresight while others proved to be blindingly short-sighted. In both cases, there are lessons to be learned and wisdom to be gained. But one thing’s for sure: successful leaders tend to share the common trait of being clever and adaptable with how best to use available resources to reach their goals. Much of the insight in these blinks is framed around the old adage of the fox and the hedgehog, and you’ll see what the characteristics of these two animals can teach us about good leadership. In these blinks you’ll find out why it’s never a good thing to be too foxy or too hedgehog-y; how Spain and England differed in their leadership of American colonies; and how the US helped create a Cold War enemy. The legendary Oxford professor and president of Wolfson College, Isaiah Berlin, once categorized writers by saying that “the fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing.” Berlin was comparing two types of writer: hedgehogs, who were people with a worldview consisting of one central idea around which everything else is related, and foxes, who paid attention to the small details and saw the world as a complex place with a variety of different, even contradictory, aspects. Plato and Dostoevsky, for example, with their devotion to a single guiding philosophy in life, are hedgehogs, while Shakespeare and Joyce, who saw life as being far from black and white, were foxes. Berlin’s analogy was quickly expanded upon by others to include famous leaders of our time. This time, the hedgehog represented a highly-driven and single-minded leader, while the fox represented someone who’s cautious and sees all the obstacles in their way. With this analogy, it became apparent that the best leaders had a healthy mixture of both fox and hedgehog characteristics. Those leaders at the extreme ends of the spectrum were either too cautious or they failed to see the big picture. Consider the story of two leaders with two different dispositions: King Xerxes of Persia, who was a hedgehog, and his advisor Artabanus, a fox. In 480 BC, these two were considering a possible invasion of Greece. Being a fox, Artabanus was cautious and saw many potential pitfalls ahead. So he advised against the invasion and tried to warn Xerxes that the journey was too long and that they’d surely run out of food and be too exhausted to fight the mighty Greek soldiers. Being a hedgehog, Xerxes was single-minded and bold in his decision-making. In his opinion, nothing risked meant nothing gained, so he ignored Artabanus’s worries and invaded. Artabanus proved to be right, as the Persians were too exhausted by the time they reached the Greek army. Artabanus may have been correct on this occasion, but a leader should be wary of his approach. There are times when a leader needs to make bold decisions, and when leaders are always like Artabanus they may never make a move. So, the ideal leader is part hedgehog and part fox – they can assess all the different angles while still being able to take determined action. Abraham Lincoln was one such leader. He was determined to get the 13th Amendment passed in order to abolish slavery and, like a fox, he pursued a variety of angles to achieve this goal – including bribery, flattery and lies. When Isaiah Berlin applied the fox-hedgehog analogy to various writers, it was nothing more than a fun parlor game. He was delighted when he found out it was being used to characterize historical leaders and other famous figures. One of the bigger applications of Berlin’s theory involved the political psychologist, Philip E. Tetlock, who conducted a massive study on expert opinions between 1988–2003. Tetlock looked at 27,451 predictions about world politics from 284 experts to determine which ones were accurate and if there were any significant common characteristics among them. The experts ranged from professors, politicians, think tank members and various other professionals, and all had various political leanings, as well as other characteristics such as pessimism or optimism. Tetlock found that all these characteristics were insignificant as an indicator of someone’s accuracy when making a prediction. What was remarkably accurate was whether or not the person self-identified as a fox or a hedgehog. Indeed, the study showed foxes to be far better at predictions. This was due to how foxes use diverse sources of information to make their predictions, along with the understanding that politics isn’t a science. Hedgehogs, on the other hand, are over-reliant on simplification and as a result, their predictions were seen to be as accurate as a chimpanzee throwing darts. According to Tetlock, another reason for the accuracy of foxes was their humble nature, which led them to be cautious and consider all possible factors before coming to a conclusion. Hedgehogs were very much the opposite: They were stubborn and unlikely to doubt themselves, meaning they were less adaptable and less likely to be right. However, Tetlock noticed that these hedgehog-experts were often popular figures in the media and television talk shows. Since they had one big idea, their message was more easily digestible – and therefore more appealing – than the complex ideas presented by foxes. So what began as a fun conversation-starter turned out to be more academically useful than Berlin could’ve ever imagined! Throughout history, there have been power-hungry leaders who’ve gotten carried away with their grand ambitions. But we’ve also seen powerless yet clever leaders who’ve managed to realize their ambitions despite their shortcomings. By making a realistic assessment of the skills they do have, a great leader can devise a plan that utilizes those skills to reach their desired goal. Take Octavian, grandnephew to Julius Caesar and inheritor his legacy and titles. Despite his youth, Octavian was wise enough to know that his limited military experience meant he wasn’t going to gain power as a heroic army general like his great-uncle Caesar. Instead, he won over Rome’s army by paying out bonuses to his loyal troops. Octavian also had to contend with other popular challengers to the throne – namely Marc Antony and Lepidus – who had far more political and military experience than he did. Octavian allowed them to divide up the empire and take the more desirable areas while agreeing to share the leadership role – he knew that being one of three rulers was better than nothing. Indeed, this position as a co-leader was the perfect place for Octavian to plot and gain his power gradually by continuing to use his smarts. By staying focused and paying attention to the obstacles, he went on to become Rome’s first emperor, under the name Augustus. But with great power comes the threat of it all going to your head – something that has led to many a downfall. This is why great leaders avoid waging war as a way to gain power and glory. As military theorist Carl von Clausewitz said, war is “an act of force to compel our enemy to do our will.” That should be its only justification; it shouldn’t be used as a power grab, which is what led to Napoleon’s demise. In 1812, Napoleon wanted to teach the Russian czar who’s boss. So, he planned to quickly invade Russia, defeat its army and return home to France in triumph before winter set in. Alas, Napoleon’s dreams of glory on the battlefield didn’t work out as planned. He chased the Russian army all the way to Moscow, only to find the city deserted and stripped of supplies. With frost already creeping upon them, there was no point occupying a barren city with exhausted and hungry troops. Napoleon had to cut his losses and retreat, but the long, deathly cold journey home cost thousands of lives. But wasn’t Napoleon known for being a superior strategist? As the author says, “Common sense is like oxygen: the higher you get the thinner it becomes.” Clearly, Napoleon’s prior victories had gone to his head, and before long it would cost him his empire. You may think that a sign of strong leadership is having obedient followers. But when those following your orders are a homogenous group with unwavering submission, it can also be a sign of weakness. For it is this very scenario that has built a house of cards in certain societies – where a small gust of resistance has sent it toppling to the ground. This is precisely what happened during the European colonization of the Americas, where the leadership of the British colonies proved to be more adaptable, and therefore more stable than their Spanish counterparts. When Elizabeth I was in control of the American colonies in the late sixteenth century, she had a fairly relaxed approach and would willingly delegate when necessary. As a result, her underlings were actively involved with the locals of the colonial settlements and were closely in tune with the concerns of each individual town and city. This, in turn, resulted in a diverse and adaptable system of government, ready to make changes that suited the town’s unique problems. Then there was Philip II of Spain, who ran his colonies in a strictly uniform manner – whether it was the kind of worship being practiced or the style of governing. At the time, it was said that a man from Lima could travel to Mexico City and feel right at home. With the Spanish empire being so homogenous and unadaptive, it meant that any spark of rebellion or adversity could quickly spread like wildfire across the colonies. Meanwhile, if a problem arose in the British colonies, the closely attuned leadership was ready to take care of it before it could spread. This adaptable leadership also meant that the US was in good shape to prosper after gaining independence. Due to the complexity of their system of leadership, many functioning local governments had already been established by the time of independence, and this is a big reason as to why the US became the only nation in the Americas capable of successfully challenging the Old World powers. Conversely, the collapse of the Spanish empire left a dangerous power vacuum in South America. With Spain’s iron fist having been clenched so tight, no one living in the colonies had any experience of governing. Simón Bolívar, the Venezuelan revolutionary leader, called this a “political immaturity” caused by the Spanish rule. It resulted in the continent remaining fragmented after gaining independence, rather than becoming a “United States of Latin America,” like their neighbors to the north. Now that we’ve looked at a few case studies from history, let’s revisit Isaiah Berlin’s concept of the fox and the hedgehog. Is leadership really as simple as these two categories suggest? The answer is no. In reality, most people exist somewhere between these two extremes. History shows us that even skilled, fox-like strategists can lose sight of the options and make hedgehog-like mistakes. This is particularly the case when leaders focus on immediate gains at the expense of long-term ones – the kind of mistake that can inadvertently strengthen a future enemy. During World War I, for example, the US and her allies convinced Russia to remain involved in the conflict. As a result, the Bolshevik resistance formed, staging a successful revolution in 1917. A big part of their success was that Russia’s leaders had been significantly weakened by the war. After the revolution, the US, led by Herbert Hoover, supported the new Russian government with an aid program that helped the nation survive the famine of 1921–22. The US also supported Stalin’s Five-Year Plan, which involved quickly turning his nation into a world power by exporting entire factories to Russia. This included ones that operated on Henry Ford’s state-of-the-art mass production techniques. Ironically, this all led to the Cold War and the Soviet Union becoming the West’s primary adversary, which is why the clever leader should always keep long-term results in mind and act accordingly. Franklin D. Roosevelt’s strategy in dealing with the Soviet Union was mainly focused on working together to weaken the powers of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan. Due to its geographical position, it was vital that Russia act as a wedge between these two nations, not a bridge. With this in mind, in 1933 FDR saw the value in recognizing the USSR as a new country, since he may very well need them as an ally in the future. With his strategies focused on the long-term, FDR wasn’t taken by surprise when Hitler and Stalin signed a nonaggression pact in 1939. After all, they were both hedgehogs. Looking beyond this initial agreement, he also knew that the lack of respect between the two single-minded men would lead to the eventual collapse of the deal. Sure enough, it did collapse. And who was there with open arms to accept the USSR when it did? FDR. Franklin D. Roosevelt is another fine example of a leader who balanced his fox and hedgehog characteristics. He had his unwavering, one-track plan to neutralize Germany and Japan, but used a variety of small, foxy maneuvers to move himself closer towards that goal. The key message in these blinks: There’s no exact formula to being a successful leader, but history is full of examples that show us the best ones keep their attention focused on a big end goal while seeking out a number of options to help realize it. They stay adaptable in order to navigate around totally unpredictable situations, without letting these potential problems derail their progress. Got feedback?

Everest? In principle, everything, according to Alison Levine, the author of the book On the Edge: The Art of High-Impact Leadership. In these blinks you’ll learn how leadership principles that work in the world of high-impact adventures also apply to contemporary business environments. Both contexts require the leaders to make critical decisions in environments that are far from perfect. You’ll also learn that “practicing” sleep deprivation can help you perform in crisis situations; why employees with experience, expertise and ego are preferable; and how complacency may kill you. Failing to rise to a challenge never feels good. You'll end up wondering if things would've gone differently if you'd only been more ready. So when a team confronts a challenge, the team leaders need to be very prepared. As a team leader, you always need to be in top form. You owe that to your team – they'll be expecting more from you than from the others. So leaders need to perform at the highest level, both physically and psychologically. This means many things. For one, you'll need to condition yourself to be able to handle situations where you can't sleep. You never know when you'll have to face a crisis situation and stay up all night. This is true whether you're leading an expedition to Mount Everest, or a team of programmers in a company. If you, as the leader, get stressed out about something minor like being tired, you'll stress the rest of your team out as well. So it's a good idea to “practice” sometimes, so you'll be ready when you have to experience it. Good leaders also understand that it's their duty to inspire leadership in others. They need to ask team members to rise to new responsibilities, so they'll grow as leaders themselves. This sort of leadership makes the team function more effectively, and also prepares them for the worst possible scenarios. This could be a matter of life or death in a place like the Himalayas. Leaders should prepare their teams so well that they're skilled enough to move ahead with the mission even without the leader. Leadership skills are essential, so you should never stop developing them. In extreme environments, it's vital that every single team member works to ensure success. And if someone starts behaving badly, there isn't any employee handbook you can look in to figure out how to deal with them! This means that leaders need to choose their team members very wisely. On climbing expeditions, where teams face danger on a daily basis, climbers literally put their lives into their partner's hands. You've already got enough uncontrollable factors affecting you on a mountaintop – you don't need team coordination problems too! In the most dangerous situations, that kind of trouble can even be deadly. In business environments, proper team dynamics can mean the difference between winning or losing market share. Whether you're in sports or business, it's crucial you choose your team members well. When you're seeking out new team members, search for people with experience, expertise and the right kind of ego. When you're taking on a mountain, you don't want to be up there with people who are just fun and easy-going. They need the necessary survival skills to succeed in that environment. You've got to find people with skill and experience. Your team members also need to have a high performance ego. That means they have to have confidence in their abilities, so they'll be ready to take on big challenges. It's also crucial that your team members have desire – and not just the desire to climb, but the desire to be part of the team. You want people who are proud to work together and take care of each other – people with team ego. In a strong team, each member cares about helping the others as much as they care about themselves. Whether you're in the mountains or an office, other teams can be a big help to you if things go wrong. In fact, you might even need them for things to go right. Collaboration is always critical to success. In business, it's quite rare for a team to operate independently, without working with other teams in the same organization. Different units have to rely on each other when working towards a certain goal. Engineering units, for example, usually rely on research and development to optimize their manufacturing processes. The same is true for expedition teams. Separate teams have to coordinate their climbs when going for the same mountain, to make sure the route doesn't get crowded. Team leaders have to communicate clearly with each other, so each team has the best possible shot at success. Effective collaboration is also vital for staying safe. In very dangerous situations, climbers need to be ready to reach out to other teams too. Strong relationships can save lives in the most critical situations. Things can always go wrong unexpectedly, even for the most prepared teams. You never know when a climbing rope might tear and a person might fall. So you'll be much safer when you can count on other people from outside your team, in case an emergency arises. In an expedition, you can't assume people you don't know will come rescue you if you need it. It's very important to foster relationships with other climbing teams. If other teams know you're out there, you're much less likely to be overlooked if your team goes missing. If you need to call for help, there's a better chance you'll get it, because people are more likely to help others if they know them, as opposed to if they're strangers. So, whether you’re climbing a real or metaphorical mountain, strong partnerships are critical for success. Dangerous situations often result from people failing to react to changes around them. When things are going well, we run the risk of becoming complacent. In some cases, that can be deadly. Sherpas, the local climbing guides of Mt. Everest, can fall victim to this. They can become overconfident on the hazardous terrain because they’re familiar with it, which has led to incidents of some not taking the proper precautions. In 2012, a climbing guide named Namgyal Tshering Sherpa tragically died when he fell into a crevasse. He hadn't clipped into his safety rope, which could've saved his life. Complacency can lead people to engage in risky behavior like this because they've gotten away with it in the past. It's easy to become complacent when you settle too much into a routine. Because complacency can be so dangerous, leaders need to watch out for it. The key to avoiding complacency is agility. In the mountains, you have to move swiftly and remain alert. You need to be ready to respond when your environment changes. This sort of agility increases your chances of survival. And it isn't just adventurers who can fall victim to complacency; businesses also suffer if they don't adjust to changes in their environment. This happened to Research in Motion (RIM), the maker of the BlackBerry smartphone. In 2008, it was valued at $80 billion. By 2012, that figure had dropped below $5 billion. Why? RIM failed to adapt to changes in the smartphone market. They didn't anticipate the rise of touchscreens, and their business model wasn't agile enough to adjust when their consumers' behavior changed. You never know when you'll need to be ready for an oncoming shift, whether in business or the mountains. It's absolutely vital to always be prepared for change. In extreme situations, the way you deal with a weak link in your team could mean the difference between success and failure. In a business, you often have to work with people who are less experienced or capable than you. In climbing teams, members will certainly have different physical capabilities. In either case, when confronted with a team member's weakness, most leaders will simply try to “cure” it. This isn't the best approach, however. Why? Because there's a fair chance their weakness can't be cured. You can change people's work attitudes, but some limitations can't be overcome, like height, speed or the specific way our brains process information. Good leaders know it's their responsibility to help team members become productive, so that everyone benefits. This doesn't necessarily mean eliminating their weaknesses. Instead, focus on compensating for weaknesses. Alison Levine learned this when she took part in a long-distance skiing expedition in Antarctica. Levine's short legs couldn't carry her as fast as her taller teammates, so she was the slowest in the group. Her team leaders compensated for her weakness instead of trying to overcome it. They told the others she was carrying too much weight, and had some of them carry part of her food supply to distribute the weight more equally. This decision took her emotional well-being into account. They didn't blame her for her weakness, which would've made her feel even worse. When they asked the other team members to help, they also engaged them so that everyone was working on the problem together. It solved the problem, and kept them close together as a team. When you take on a challenge – no matter what it is – you're always responsible for your own preparation. Team leaders, however, have the most responsibility. Leaders are responsible for knowing what tools are needed to get the job done. Even if you have the skills, you'll fail without the right equipment. Germany learned this lesson in June of 1941, when they invaded the Soviet Union. They had millions of armed soldiers, and thousands of tanks and horses, but they didn't bring warm enough clothes for the winter, or the right tools to maintain their equipment in the cold. Most historians agree that this was the main reason Germany's attack failed: they simply didn't pack well. So even if you've got people and enough money, you won't achieve your goals without the proper gear. Leaders have to know what skills and tools are needed to get the job done. Leaders also need to make sure their team is properly equipped. Not having the right equipment can be dangerous. Levine experienced this when she climbed the Carstensz Pyramid, the highest peak in Oceania. She misjudged the time it would take to get to the summit, then had to climb back down in the dark. She didn't have a working headlamp, so she couldn't see anything while climbing. She put her life at stake by not being prepared. So if you're thinking you can't afford all the gear you need, ask yourself if you can afford not to have it. Also, remember that even if one team member doesn't have the right equipment, it could affect the team as a whole. Leaders need to be sure that everyone is prepared. Don't ever underestimate the importance of treating others with respect and kindness, especially when it comes to achieving a goal. When you treat people well, they'll usually reciprocate. Good leaders show their team that they care about them. It doesn't matter whether you're leading an expedition or a software development group – your team has to know they're important to you. You don't automatically get trust and respect by virtue of being a leader. You have to earn it, by treating your team members right. Mark Zuckerberg, for example, keeps his desk in the center of the common workspace at Facebook. He works alongside his employees, and sends the message that they're all in it together. Leaders guide the team towards the goal, and also make sure the team members are performing as best they can. They have to get to know the people they lead. When you take time to get to know your team, you'll show them how much they matter to you. One good way to do this is to find out what's important to them, like their families, hobbies, interests outside work, or hopes for the future. Those interactions lay the foundation for strong bonds. When you really get to know your team, you'll also be able to assess their abilities. A person who likes being part of a big family, for instance, probably wants more social and collaborative tasks. You have to approach each person individually when it comes to helping them perform at their best. The more you know about them, the more influence you have as a leader. Generally, rules exist for a reason. But don't think of them as strict laws that you have to follow blindly. Instead, view your rules as guiding principles. Sometimes great things can happen when you break the rules. This happened to Channing Moss, a soldier, when his platoon was on patrol in southeastern Afghanistan in 2006. Moss's convoy was hit with some rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs). An unexploded RPG entered Moss's body, essentially turning him into a human bomb. The standard procedure for that situation would've been to sandbag him in an area where he wouldn't be a danger to anyone if he exploded, then basically wait for him to die. Fortunately, the medical team chose not to obey the rules. Moss was airlifted to an aid station and the explosive device was removed – at the extreme risk of the medical personnel. The procedure was successful, and Moss was saved. In extreme situations like that one, leaders have to make decisions that can move everyone toward the best possible outcomes. This often requires breaking the rules. In fact, just robotically following the rules can be harmful. In 2011, for example, a parade was planned in Shelter Island, New York to pay homage to a soldier named Joseph Theinert who was killed in Afghanistan. American flags were hung on the utility poles along the parade route. LIPA, the local utility company, billed the town for hanging the flags, because it was a rule to charge a fee to use them. The amount of the bill was $23 in total. When the story hit national news, LIPA had serious PR problems – it faced a popular outrage. So, there are times to follow rules and times to break them. Leaders need to know the difference. Our actions say a lot about who we are. So we should all have a credo – a set of key words that reminds us how to behave in our professional and personal lives. Companies need credos too. Leaders can't be everywhere at once, so they've got to trust their team to do the right thing even when they aren't being watched. Verizon, for example, has a credo built around the words integrity, respect, performance excellence and accountability. If a company has a set of guiding principles like those, employees will have better judgement in tricky situations. A leader can build her identity by making a conscious effort to demonstrate her credo. As a leader, you have to know what you stand for, and what you value most. So what's your credo? How do you want people to describe you? Levine's credo is “Count on me.” She aspires to be the person her teammates always go to when they need help. A credo like hers can help you become the great leader you truly want to be. Remember, however, that having a credo isn't just about writing down some words. It's about taking action and living those words every day. When you live by your credo, you'll be able to gain the trust and loyalty of your team members. They'll know what to expect from you. So be sure to demonstrate your leadership philosophy on a daily basis! Your credo will also help you stay true to yourself and your beliefs, even in extreme circumstances. Physical or mental strain can threaten your values, but your credo will remind you of who you want to be. The key message in this book: The leadership  principles that apply to extreme adventure sports also apply to today’s extreme business environments. Both environments require the team to face sudden, unintended, high-risk situations. So be prepared, take care of your team members individually, and inspire them to become leaders themselves. Actionable advice: Don't try to eliminate all weaknesses. Remember that some weaknesses simply can't be eliminated. Compensate for weaknesses, rather than trying to squash them. Doing so allows team members to make the most of their strengths, and work around any setbacks.

Grove","summary":"During his time as CEO of Intel, Andrew Grove helped the company to overcome numerous apparently insurmountable hurdles to its existence. In Only The Paranoid Survive, Grove draws on his experiences to present a strategic model that can help companies not only to cope with moments of critical change, but also to exploit them and thrive. Terming such moments strategic inflection points – or SIPs – Grove presents invaluable advice for making the most of the sink-or-swim moments in a company’s life. In the following blinks, you’ll learn why it’s not always a good idea for a company to keep secrets. You’ll find out why you should maintain open communication with outsiders like journalists. And you’ll learn why it’s a terrible idea for a company to trust the opinion of someone who feels emotionally attached to it. There are critical moments during the life of any company when its entire strategy needs to be brought into question. These are known as strategic inflection points (SIPs). But what’s behind these moments of crisis? There are six forces at play in the “competitive well-being” of a company which can compel it to consider its strategic options. These forces are the strength of its competitors, suppliers, existing customers, potential customers and complementors, and, finally, the possibility that business can be done in a different way. Any disturbance in the balance of these forces will transform the company’s business environment. Consider, for example, the computer company IBM, which was greatly affected by a major shift in how its business could be done. Once it became possible for consumers to combine components (like microchips, hard drive and software) that were produced and sold by different companies in an individual PC, pre-built computers were no longer as popular. Customers simply preferred selecting their own parts and combining them to make a PC of their own design. Although IBM tried to continue developing its pre-built PCs, their overall design failed to compete with the possibilities of the customizable PC. The result? They sold fewer PCs than other companies sold components. Although it’s clear that any change in these forces may alter the way that companies can succeed in a given market, it can sometimes be difficult for a company to spot even a major change. For instance, while changes in technology are usually quite easy to detect, because inventions or improvements directly linked to the production process or the business itself are ordinarily fairly concrete and observable, a change in the strength of a competitor will be harder to notice. Since some of these six forces are easier to spot than others, companies should be on the lookout for any changes which might affect them. SIPs are not relevant to CEOs alone. Rather, they have an impact on a company at every level – and, therefore, on every single employee. For that reason, all employees should be prepared for such critical situations, as jobs are often endangered at these moments. In extreme cases, an SIP can even result in a business shutting down, which means that every single employee loses their job. But even if the company manages to survive, it might have to restructure, resulting in some workers becoming unemployed. And in still other cases, people are forced to acquire new skills and to adapt to new, unfamiliar business environments. Often, an SIP forces employees to change the way that they operate as individuals in the market. When, for example, the first “talkie” movies were released, actors were impelled to choose whether to stick with silent movies or adapt to the new way of acting that movies with sound required. While some failed to redefine themselves as sound movie stars, others succeeded – though sometimes reluctantly. Charlie Chaplin, for instance, was a bitter opponent to “the coming of sound,” yet ultimately even he was forced to submit and produce his first “talkie,” The Great Dictator. Furthermore, SIPs have even caused some types of jobs to become almost extinct. This is especially true in the case of major technological changes. For example, at the beginning of industrialization, traditional craftsmanship was in danger of becoming obsolete, as factories were able to produce the same products much faster and cheaper. Because their skills were no longer in demand, almost all craftsmen were forced to quit their businesses and work at the factories. The few craftsmen who could survive independently were those who specialized in higher-quality production, thereby distinguishing their businesses. Individuals as well as companies must react to SIPs, and they can do this by properly analyzing their individual situation, specializing or acquiring new skills. The development of the Japanese memory-chip industry had a huge impact on Intel (formerly a memory chip company) because the Japanese were able to sell chips at prices Intel simply couldn’t match. As a remedy, Intel invested heavily in the development of its chips, but to no avail. The company faced an existential crisis. To the dismay of the management and existing employees, Intel decided that it would have to change everything that had been crucial to their success so far, from their oldest plants to their most established departments. Intel had little choice. An SIP can lead to a total catastrophe for a company if its management doesn’t recognize the new situation and react appropriately. One reason that managers ignore new developments is that they’re emotionally attached to the existing way of doing business. A consequence of this is that while a company continues to reproduce the same, once-successful measures as always, the already transformed business environment means that those measures might now result in outright failure – as when Intel tried to fight the powerful Japanese memory-chip industry by investing in the development of its own chips. However, if a company adopts an effective strategy at precisely the right time, SIPs offer them the opportunity to establish and lead a completely new market. Also, having to re-position a business in a new market – but one which also requires a similar business strategy – can have positive effects. In the case of Intel, their strategy in the face of Japanese companies was a combination of technological development and new, strategic positioning of their business. Specifically, they put their focus and their resources into microprocessors, redefining themselves as a microprocessor company – a field in which they became the market leader in a very short time. SIPs can be very dangerous for companies. However, by taking the right action at the right time, SIPs can present a chance for success in the future. When an SIP strikes, there’s a chance of serious confusion within a company. What direction should the company take? Should they make permanent changes, or only temporary ones? This uncertainty demands that someone has a clear sense of the direction the company should take. What’s needed is a leader. In large companies, it’s the CEO who must have a clear vision of the company’s future. They have to communicate their vision clearly and constantly, as failure to do so can have negative consequences. For example, the head of one Japanese company was asked about its general strategy, but he refused to discuss it, fearing the competition would use the information to their advantage. Whether correct in that fear or not, his silence sent a negative message to the company’s employees and to the public. When a company’s strategy must be redefined, CEOs mustn’t be scared of changing the core of the business. This is not easy to accomplish, as they and their staff are usually emotionally attached to the business in its present state. Another reason that redefining strategy is difficult is that it can involve letting a lot of jobs go and employing new staff in new positions. However, again, you must face this task without fear, and persevere with it. For example, until the memory crisis of the 1980s, Intel had been the memory company. Andrew Grove, its CEO (and the book’s author) insisted that the senior staff redefine Intel as “the microprocessor company,” and though there was an initial resistance, eventually many of the staff appreciated having a new vision they could champion. Once a new strategy has been introduced, it then has to be implemented. To do this, you must first deliver the message to the relevant people, and secondly, act as role-models for the rest of the company by committing immediately to the new strategy and all it entails. The confusion that SIPs can trigger over a company’s direction can destroy team morale and cohesion, which means that the people involved won’t be certain of what they should do. This can affect a company both internally and externally. For instance, employees will have no clear vision to follow, and they might be scared of losing their jobs, while a company’s partners and suppliers might fret over how future changes will affect them. In order to avoid such uncertainty, companies must ensure that all their actions are in line with a clearly defined new vision. This means that the redefinition of the business must be reflected in changes to its organizational structure. New staff need to be hired or old staff retrained. And new complementors and suppliers may need to be found. For the change to go as smoothly as possible, the new vision has to be communicated in a simple, effective message, internally and externally. It’s essential to convince all employees of this new vision, as – to remain effective – they need to identify themselves with the new order of things. Also, complementors and suppliers need to be informed of the company’s new vision so that they can adjust to the demands it entails, and they should also be made aware that a future partnership is possible. The simpler the message, the more effective it will be. One reason for this is that simple messages tend to stick in the mind, and they may also give people a sense of security. Another reason is that they’re more likely to be picked up and reproduced as headlines and soundbites by the media. In short, the moment a company arrives at a new vision for its strategy, that strategy should be communicated clearly – in words and actions – so that employees and the outside world can learn of the change and react accordingly. Companies in critical situations often employ consultants to analyze their business, and to suggest an effective course of action. The reason for employing consultants in this role is that they have a more objective perspective on the situation. In contrast, those working for the company are often emotionally involved in the work they do, which means that their opinions are biased. The reason for this level of involvement is that work is often an essential part of a person’s self-image, and a change in what they do brings their entire personality into question. People can feel very comfortable and “at home” in their team, and therefore tend to resist any changes to it. For example, when Intel went through the “memory crisis,” some of its oldest production plants were running at a loss. The result was that they had to be shut down and their resources redeployed to other plants. Many among the senior staff resisted these developments because they were attached to the “origin story” that they’d played a role in; they remembered when those plants were first opened, in the early days of that story. As far as possible, leaders should try to make themselves immune to such attachments, and instead adopt the more objective view of an outsider to shift their own perspective. Seeing the business with fresh eyes can be accomplished, for example, by talking to consultants, or employing new people. At the same time, however, leaders must always be open to the criticisms that will probably come their way. Outsiders are more likely to see the flaws and mistakes that insiders will just as likely miss. Faced with such criticisms, leaders will have to ensure their egos do not get in the way if they’re identified with whatever decision or action is being criticized. Many companies try to keep certain information secret, especially when it concerns new strategies and products. However, this secrecy can mean that a business’s upper management will fail to pass crucial information down to middle management about goals and strategies. Neglecting to maintain open communication between upper and middle management is ill-advised. This is because staff in the middle of the company are often first to identify a business’s problems. For one thing, they’re closer to its daily operations and are therefore sensitive to the slight changes that can accumulate to a threatening situation. For that reason, they should be encouraged to openly communicate their fears and observations, as often they have good ideas about how businesses can be run differently. For example, Grove received an email from a sales manager in the Asia-Pacific area in which the manager discussed a potential competitor. Faced with this new information, Grove decided to initiate a study on the case. Had the sales manager not felt comfortable informing Grove, Grove wouldn't have been aware of the competitor’s existence. Other people with whom companies should always maintain close contact are business partners, outside experts and journalists, as they might have a broader view on the market situation as a whole. For instance, a company should stay in touch with its complementor, as they are a driving force behind the business. And by keeping close to outside experts, a company’s senior management is able to learn of market constellations which they’d otherwise not recognize. Finally, even journalists – if they ask critical questions – can lead a manager to a welcome shift in perspective. Change in the business environment can come from anywhere – even from within. Therefore, it’s important to stay on the watch and get information from as many sources as possible.  The culture of a company can be a decisive factor in its ability to survive periods of great trouble. If people are not challenged with new problems, they become accustomed to the current situation and are then less flexible in times of major change. This kind of mindset can be deadly for a company when hitting an SIP, so it’s essential both that employees are accustomed to acquiring new skills and that the team is flexible. This is because, firstly, people who acquire a variety of skills are able to reflect on a situation from multiple points of view. And those employees habituated to learning are able to adjust to new tasks more easily: if an employee is able to think “outside the box,” with the box being his or her direct working field, he or she will be well positioned to find better solutions to the working process. Secondly, a team that is flexible creates a trusting environment in which new ideas can develop and prosper. Indeed, creativity can grow only in an environment where people are free to search for their own solutions. Thus employees should be made to feel comfortable in suggesting trying out new ideas and practices, such as the redeployment of resources. Another benefit to team flexibility is that staff morale will increase, because it’s quite simply more enjoyable to work in a climate that encourages individuals to be creative, and that remains flexible to individual desires and suggestions. In sum, mutual trust and flexibility lead to a positive working climate. They train people to unite in critical situations and come up with new ways to resolve challenges. Business situations are complex and capable of changing in an instant. In such an environment, only the paranoid survive. This means that companies must be prepared and on the watch for the danger that can come from every corner. Yet in some situations just keeping watch isn’t enough; they need to be prepared for multiple or even unknown scenarios. For that reason, a company should channel sufficient resources to innovation and development because in doing so it can increase its chances of being first on the market with a new product, and thus diminish much of its competitors’ strength. Also, people who work in development are more up to date with technical possibilities, which is valuable knowledge in times of instability, like SIPs. Secondly, if the outcome of a market situation is not predictable, companies should be prepared for every possible outcome. Of course this means that some of the resources will be invested in vain. But, more positively, the skills people acquire in the process might turn out to be useful later on. Also, this kind of preparation can give a company an idea of the possible costs and consequences of implementing a particular technology. A typical example is the tug of war between Blu-Ray and HD-DVD. Since it was not at all clear which of the two formats would become more popular, it would’ve been wise for a company producing DVDs or DVD players to develop solutions for both formats. Of course, part of this investment would undoubtedly be in vain, because one of the technologies was certain to fail eventually. Investments in development are crucial because they can provide a company with the opportunity to react quickly to new situations – or even to be the driving force of the market. But whether the technologies and techniques that were developed are implemented or not, an innovative company is always more likely to stand on its feet in critical and unfamiliar situations. The key message in this book: Managers and employees of companies should prepare themselves for the inevitable moments of crisis that occur in a company’s life. These are termed SIPs – Strategic Inflection Points – and by acting on a few key principles these critical points can be not only overcome, but also exploited for the company’s good. Actionable ideas in this book: Look to outsiders for an objective opinion Even though they might be emotionally attached to a particular image or origin story of their company, managers should always try to view their company’s situation as objectively as possible. If a new, scary situation arises, one should always seek impartial counsel from outside the company, consider all the options one has and then act decisively. ","headers":["What’s in it for me?

Maybe you were once a hugely imaginative child, always busy drawing, playing, inventing stories or crafting crazy objects, but now that you’ve finally earned yourself a “creative” job, the artistic ideas just aren’t flowing. The good news is that your creativity isn’t dead, you just need to free it. Unfortunately, however, it’s being held hostage by a giant hairball of corporate regulations, guidelines and practices trying to make you normal – too normal to be creative. These blinks tell you all you need to know about that hairball, including how to escape it without leaving your company altogether. You’ll also find out about a bunch of hypnotized chickens; what’s so great about being foolish; and how a creative company is a bit like a dancefloor. Are you an artist? Well, if you don’t make paintings or write poetry, you might be inclined to say no. But don’t be so quick to dismiss this possibility. In truth, every one of us is born a creative genius. Undisciplined children make rash decisions, diving spontaneously into risky situations and saying and doing whatever they like. They are driven purely by curiosity and innocent desire. These childhood tendencies are an expression of creative genius at the core being of every person. Everyone is born with this blissful “foolishness” that leads us to discover and evolve. However, lots of people fear that a society of “fools,” that is, one made up of people who follow their creative genius, can never function. So, they stifle their creativity in an attempt to be “normal.” This makes perfect sense from a societal perspective. After all, “fools” are seen as impulsive, unpredictable rule-breakers, and the enforcement of strict social norms is about protecting society from this unpredictability. Unfortunately, such protection also suppresses creative genius. For example, on many occasions, the author asked children from different grades if they considered themselves to be artists. When he asked first graders, they would all enthusiastically raise their hands, but when he got to the second graders, about half would identify themselves as artists. By the time he reached the sixth graders, only one or two kids would raise their hands. So, we can see that society suppresses creativity. But we can do something about it.       To break open the full potential of our creative genius, or if you prefer, our foolishness, we have to stop aiming for normalcy and stand up to the rules that enforce it. Can you remember the last time you bought a greeting card? Well, chances are it was made by Hallmark. After all, the company is a household name around the world. And like the majority of corporations, Hallmark is also a huge hairball of corporate normalcy.  In 1910, when Joyce Clyde Hall set out to start his “social expression company,” there wasn’t a single comparable business around. Hall had to write his own rules. He developed the first policies and procedures for doing business. These became the first two hairs of the corporate hairball. Then, in the following years, thousands of other policies and procedures were produced, all of them tangling together and forming a massive knot. This knotted hairball is the symbol of corporate normalcy – all the procedures, policies and guidelines that define what will conventionally make a company work more effectively, quickly and cheaply. Naturally, people are pulled into these hairballs of corporate normalcy as well. After all, we know from physics that gravity exerts a tremendous pull toward the earth that prevents us from careening out into space. We also know that the force of gravity becomes greater as the mass in question grows larger and larger. In a similar way, as the hairball becomes larger, and as more layers of guidelines, standards and procedures are added, so too does the pull toward it become increasingly powerful. Say you work for a new advertising company. The firm starts off by introducing a standard corporate design, which means every ad you make should have the same basic layout and color palette. Then they add a creativity guideline requiring you to attend brainstorming meetings and, finally, a new accountability guideline instructs you to write a daily progress report. With each additional rule, you’re pulled deeper and deeper into corporate normalcy. But is all that necessarily bad? Isn’t there some comfort in being part of a giant corporate hairball? Maybe, but it can also be problematic, which is what we’ll explore next. Have you ever been given a so-called “creative” assignment that required you to use a particular material, format and color scheme? If so, you know this is exactly what “creating” is not. Rather, creating is the act of producing something truly original, totally unobstructed by procedures and guidelines. And to engage in such creative work, it’s essential to avoid being snagged by the hairball, which is solely made up of how things used to be. For instance, early on in his time at Hallmark, the author was a sketch artist tasked with “creating.” But he found himself abiding too strictly to the company’s style. How did this happen? Well, the hairball is made up of old rules and practices; in other words, things that once worked. And since the hairball is so full of these old ways, there’s no space for novelty or originality. If you want to truly create, you have to first avoid being pulled too deep into that tangle of procedures. You need to orbit around the hairball, engaging with responsible creativity, which is a handy way to go beyond corporate normalcy. Responsible creativity entails straying from the standard corporate path, but not by too much. After all, if you disregard the company’s mission and aimlessly drift off into space, you won’t be part of the company at all. So, it’s crucial to remain within the orbit of the hairball by treating your company with loyalty and respect. But it’s also important to keep a critical distance and avoid being sucked in by its uncreative procedures and bureaucracy. For example, the author was initially hired by Hallmark’s editorial department. But the people in his department lacked any eccentricity, and just plodded along with the usual corporate decorum. So the author transferred to the Contemporary Design Department, Hallmark’s crazy stepchild. This department was doing tremendously successful and original work, and it was all thanks to the team’s freedom, chaos and playfulness. The author knew that the best way he could be creative for the company was to work in a department that granted him a bit more freedom. In other words, finding your personal sweet spot is the key. In the next blink, we’ll explore more in-depth ways to find your orbit and stay with it. Unless you’re starting to lose your marbles, you probably know that you’re not a chicken. Even so, you might be just as mesmerized as a chicken and in line for a similar fate. How so? Well, in 1904, the author’s father spent the summer in Ontario, Canada with his aunt and uncle on their farm. One playful Sunday morning, he and his cousin drew lines on the porch with a piece of chalk and then headed for the chicken coop. There, they pulled out dozens of chickens, one by one, put them on the chalk lines and held them in place for a moment. As a result, the chickens stood perfectly still, hypnotized in place. And, whether you believe it or not, you’re prone to such hypnosis as well. When you’re brought on board by a new company, they tell you all about their history, philosophy, procedures and politics. They then explain that adherence to these principles forms the essence of the company, and that it’s the ticket to their, and your, success. Here’s where you need to look out because, in essence, the company is drawing a chalk line for you to stand on. They’ll hold you to it, and, if you’re not careful, you’ll be hypnotized and immobilized before you know it. But there’s a way to avoid this hypnosis: hold on to your creativity and move away from the corporate line by following your own unique mind. After all, regardless of what opinions you hold, you’re unique insofar as you are the only you. There’s nobody else who has exactly your experiences, skills and passions. And to stay creative when working within a corporate culture, it’s essential to hold on to what makes you unique. Find the company goals that resonate with you and contribute to them in your own distinctive way. Nobody likes hanging out in small, enclosed spaces. So why do corporations hold on to job descriptions that serve as nothing more than restrictive cages? Granted, the container was an amazing invention. For instance, our ancestors needed water to survive, but it was risky to venture out of their caves for a drink. So, they looked for something to hold their water inside the caves and the container was born. But when it comes to companies, containers only serve to confine people in unnecessarily narrow job descriptions. Some job descriptions dictate exactly what the employee should and shouldn’t do, as well as what they’re supposed to deliver and how. In general, all job descriptions limit employees to a certain position from which they’re not allowed to deviate; in other words, they’re restrictive. But it doesn’t have to be this way. Instead, corporations can let their employees free on the dance floor, so to speak. Many organizations fear that, without job descriptions, employees won’t know what to do; they’re worried that conflict, chaos and confusion will ensue. But this assumption is totally false. After all, on a dance floor, dancers move freely without colliding and, similarly, employees who are free of restrictions do their work and cooperate. They’re capable of adapting their behaviors to those around them and to the changing demands of their company. So, getting rid of job descriptions is good for employees, but it’s also good for companies. Removing job descriptions will make a company more adaptable, since it can assign tasks to whoever is capable of handling them. For example, a graphic designer from the product design department who’s particularly well suited to web design could seamlessly join a group tasked with building the company’s new website. The key message in this book: Beware the dark, dull space of corporate normalcy, the place where any original thought will be smothered through procedure, guidelines and policies. Instead, let your natural-born creativity blossom by balancing the missions and goals of your company with your own originality.  Got feedback?

This is because we think that creativity is a gift reserved for those lucky people, often artists, who, we assume, were born composing sonatas or directing movies. But the truth is that all human beings are highly creative and that creativity takes many forms, from developing a new pharmaceutical product to figuring out a paper-sorting system at the office. So why do so many people think they’re uncreative drudges? Well, part of the problem is that we aren’t taught to be creative. Whether in school or in traditional office jobs, we’re prepared to solve tasks and obey orders, to apply systems and to learn content unthinkingly. No wonder most people feel unable to be creative after years of being put back into line. But it’s never too late to change. In these blinks, you’ll learn what creativity really is; why we need creativity more than ever; and how to promote creativity in your own company or family. In less than a lifetime, there’s been a world of change. Today, when you take a look at your iPhone, you have more computing power in the palm of your hand than was available on the entire planet in 1940. And the pace of development is only increasing. So much so, that the speed of today’s technological evolution is truly extraordinary. If we look at the past 3,000 years as if it were the past 12 hours, every minute would equal 50 years. So it would only be three minutes ago that we moved beyond the antiquated transportation of sailboats and horse-driven carriages. Two and a half minutes ago the first automobiles appeared and 30 seconds later the first powered airplane took flight. Fifty seconds ago was the 1969 moon landing, and just one second ago, in 2010, the first unmanned spacecraft that could make its own landings was launched. If we turn our attention to communication, we see even faster progress. While the first PC was invented 41 seconds ago, the internet began just 25 seconds ago and SMS messaging arrived just 3 seconds after that. Clearly, today’s technology has come a long way in just a short matter of time, and even a common modern digital watch has more power and memory than NASA’s 1969 Apollo Moonlander. Since today’s technology is so quick to advance, the competitive edge will really come down to who has the best creative ideas. This makes creativity an essential skill for any future business leader to learn. Likewise, as businesses and trends continue to rapidly evolve, having one job over the course of an entire career will become a thing of the past. It will be those with flexible and adaptable talents who will flourish in tomorrow’s job market. It’s easy to assume that today’s education system has always been around. But in fact the idea behind a mandatory grade-school education has only been with us since the mid-nineteenth century. Before that, any sort of formal education was a privilege for a select few. The public education system was developed around 1860 as a way to produce workers for the industrial revolution. Of course, as many people as possible should receive an education, but we can still see how the large classrooms of public schools mirror the principles of industrial production. The advantage of this assembly-line approach to schooling was that it allowed nations to prepare future workers for jobs in manufacturing, engineering and efficiently rapid production. The students were expected to strictly conform, be organized and follow standardized tests. No matter that some students excel or show an interest in certain subjects; everyone was expected to take the same courses, use the same stale material and be graded on the same scale. And not much has changed. Much like workers at a factory, students in modern schools are still expected to respond to the bells and alarms that tell them when it’s time to take a break or have lunch. Even the progression of education, from first grade to second grade and so on, is quite similar to the linear principles of manufacturing. And teachers are much like the assembly-line supervisors, divided up into specialties to make sure certain tasks are performed as the students move down the assembly line, going from room to room. Every stage of the system builds logically upon the last one, and students are considered successful as long as they progress normally in this manufactured process. But as we’ll see in the next blink, this system no longer reflects the modern business world. We’ve moved beyond assembly lines, and so should our system of education. Over the past 30 years, the number of college graduates entering the job market has more than doubled. But that doesn’t mean they’re well prepared for the demands of the modern job market. What current curriculums are especially lacking is an emphasis on art and creativity. This is particularly the case in high schools, which tend to focus on subjects that are included in standardized tests – the metric used to determine how well any given school is performing. As a result, high-school curriculums emphasize mathematics, language and science first and foremost. The humanities usually come in second, which covers history, geography and social studies. The arts get the least amount of attention. When the Bush administration passed the No Child Left Behind Act, in 2001, the goal was to raise academic standards by increasing the amount of college prep and making teachers accountable for student performances. But it did this by focusing on standardized testing, which is solely concerned with math and English. It also linked how much funding schools would get with how high their test scores are. Naturally, this put pressure on schools to cover the tested subjects, turning arts and creative disciplines into an afterthought. It also devastated the amount of funding the arts received at schools, even though these are the subjects that help develop a person’s sense of self-expression and creativity. And for those hoping to have a successful career in the future, self-expression and creativity are crucial skills. In a 2010 study conducted by researchers at IBM, the world’s top business and private sector leaders were asked to name the most important leadership quality, and they all had the same reply: creativity. Each one believed that this trait would help their organization succeed in the unpredictable future. What really sets humans apart from the rest of the animal kingdom? It isn’t that we walk on two feet or use tools – there are plenty of other animals that also share these traits. What really sets us apart and defines human nature is the incomparable scope of our imagination. Imagination is what allows us to see beyond the present moment and our immediate environment. It’s what we use to consider things that we have yet to experience, to revisit and analyze the past, to improve our understanding of the present by seeing through other people’s eyes and to help shape the future by anticipating the various possible outcomes. Imagination is also the source of our unlimited powers of creativity. You can think of creativity as taking imagination one step further and putting it to work. In other words, creativity is applied imagination. When you’re being creative, you’re coming up with original ideas that have value and doing something with those ideas. It doesn’t have to be in the service of the arts, either. It can be in math, engineering, writing or business. Creativity can make use of a physical medium like wood, fabric or food; or a sensory medium, like sound, light or the voice; or it may be a cognitive medium, like words or numbers. It’s also about asking new questions that help to push a field in new directions, or to bring together different ideas that were previously unconnected. There are two steps to the creative process. The first is generating new ideas and the second is evaluating those ideas in order to elaborate upon, refine or reject them. Not all creative ideas are immediately accepted or celebrated. There are countless artists, scientists and innovators whose ideas were initially received with ridicule or scorn. Some died penniless and unappreciated, and it would take later generations to rediscover their ideas and recognize their worth. Innovation happens when you’re able to put an original creative idea into practice. And this generally happens when a new product is created or a new service or system is introduced. It may sound straightforward, yet many business leaders run into two misconceptions when attempting to promote innovation. First of all, they fear that the responsibility for coming up with new ideas will fall on them alone. However, the main role of a creative leader is to nurture and facilitate an environment where others can be creative. The other misconception is that a creative environment is one where they must let go of all control and embrace chaos. But this isn’t the case, either. In fact, creativity and innovation thrive when there’s a comfortable balance between experimentation and traditional supervision. When business leaders fear creativity, they’re usually beholden to the kind of traditional workplace structures that date back to 1900, when Frederick Taylor’s The Principles of Scientific Management was published. This was a popular guidebook for the industrial revolution, as it described how a human workforce could operate with machine-like efficiency in order to maximize productivity and profit. But it’s important to remember that the industrial-revolution model is a thing of the past and only serves to stifle creativity these days. Today, innovative leaders need to be flexible in order to build a creative environment. Flexibility is the only way to handle the current rapid changes in technology, as well as in financial policies, trade arrangements and new global competition. Being flexible should extend throughout the company, and be encouraged by the structure of the business itself, from the everyday work patterns of the employees to the physical structures of the workspaces. In the final blink, we’ll take a closer look at how you can create the right kind of internal flexibility. When you think of creativity, you might have an image of one person, hard at work in their studio or garage, toiling away on their own. But more often than not, creativity is the result of people exchanging ideas and working together. One way to help facilitate creativity is to bring together different perspectives through interdisciplinary teams. This is what the company IDEO does, and it’s a reason why they’re one of the best and most innovative design consultants in the world. Teams at IDEO help develop toys, office equipment, computers and more, and the company is regularly ranked among the top 25 innovative companies by Business Week. For every project, IDEO creates a team of specialists from different disciplines, including engineering, product design, behavioral science, ergonomics and marketing, among many others. Since every expert contributes a different perspective and skill set, these teams represent a powerful combination of ideas and can come up with a variety of solutions for every problem. And each idea can then be prototyped, critiqued and tested until they find the very best solution. These teams are also a great example of the creative benefits of different ideas. For successful creativity, information needs to flow freely, so teams and organizations should let go of rigid hierarchies. This way, leaders will have access to as many unique ideas as possible. Pixar uses this strategy, which is perhaps why the animation studio is so innovative, celebrated and financially successful. Since launching Toy Story in 1995, it has won over 20 Academy Awards and earned more than $5.5 billion at the box office worldwide. Part of the company’s structure is Pixar University, which offers workshops, lectures and courses, including a complete filmmaking curriculum and classes on drawing and creative writing. The University isn’t for animators only. Everyone on Pixar’s payroll, including accountants, security guards and catering staff, can spend up to four hours every week taking classes. With this constant diversity, there’s a steady flow of new ideas moving through the organization. And since people from different departments are constantly connecting with each other, ideas, both new and not-so new, are constantly being cross-pollinated, making for a truly creative environment. The key message in this book: If you hope to thrive in the twenty-first century, you’re going to need to be creative. Technological and social change is happening at an incredible speed, and in order to adapt to the shifting realities in our economy and organizations, employees and managers alike must start working creatively. Actionable Advice Allow your child to be flexible and follow their own true north. Every parent hopes that their child will find his or her own way in life. For example, that they’ll establish a steady career as a teacher or physician rather than switching wildly from, say, philosophy to art history to economics. But life isn’t linear and your child doesn’t need to map out their career from the start. As long as they love what they do and stay flexible and open to opportunity, they can always thrive. You never know: your daughter’s wide-ranging interests in philosophy, art history and economics may be the perfect qualifications to land her a job at an auction house. Got feedback?

That’s where the concept of oversubscription comes in. Instead of competing with giants, you have to carve out your own market and create a loyal customer base that will be clamoring for every product you release – so much so that demand will exceed supply and you’ll become oversubscribed! From focusing on innovation to maintaining great customer relations, there are a lot of different ways to get your brand to stand apart. The following blinks will explore how some brands have managed to keep ahead of the competition and, of course, how you can emulate their successes. In these blinks, you’ll learn that a small but dedicated group of fans is enough to keep you afloat; why music festivals sell early-bird tickets; and what made the iPod such a huge success when it was released in 2003. Every year there will be some expensive new gadget or device that people really don’t need, yet they’ll desire it nonetheless. There’s nothing mysterious about this since it all comes down to popularity and scarcity: When everyone else has a certain thing, you’ll want to have it, too. And when something is so popular that it’s hard to come by, that’s when something becomes really desirable. You may have learned the laws of supply and demand in grade school, but these days, the secret of success is in the laws demand and supply. When there is more demand and buyers than there are products and supply, this causes a business to become oversubscribed. This might sound bad, but it’s actually a good thing. Indeed, it’s a powerful means of generating profit. One of the best examples is the iPhone. Whenever Apple releases a new version, it’s guaranteed to sell out before the phone even goes on sale. Now, this isn’t a problem for Apple. They want people to see long lines of iPhone enthusiasts waiting for days to be the first ones to buy the latest model. It’s free promotion that shows how huge the demand is. However, demand can shift over time. For Apple, their iPhone needs to remain desirable even as companies like Samsung get increasingly competitive. One of the biggest challenges to staying oversubscribed is knowing how to respond to a market that becomes flooded with similar products once there’s an obvious demand. In the 1980s, plastic surgery was an oversubscribed business, with a handful of doctors that could charge enormous fees and still be fully booked. But after thousands of other doctors joined in, prices had to be greatly reduced in order to remain competitive. So a great way of remaining oversubscribed is to carve out your own niche market with loyal customers. Moet & Chandon, the makers of Dom Pérignon champagne, is a good example. While there are a lot of champagnes out there, Moet & Chandon have managed to build a luxury brand that is regarded as the best of the best. So customers who want to impress know exactly where to turn. Finding a niche market is easier said than done, as is inventing a popular new product. Nevertheless, one of the best ways to start an oversubscribed business is to come up with a truly innovative and unique product. Being truly unique and inventive means you have no competition, which is what happened when the iPod came out. Since no one else had ever offered a user-friendly, well-designed MP3 player, there was no market for the iPod before it came out. So when the iPod was released in 2002 there was no competition; it had the market all to itself. When competition does arrive, you can make sure your customers stick with you by building strong relationships. A traditional, yet reliable way of doing this is through the use of contracts. When you’re searching for a phone carrier, for instance you consider a load of offers, carefully comparing each plan. Once you select a carrier and sign a contract, say, for 24 months, you are committed to a relationship with that carrier and the others no longer matter. Another path to oversubscription is to make a more convenient version of something that already exists. A classic example of this is Amazon, the online one-stop shopping center that put everything under one roof. Anyone with an internet connection can casually browse their seemingly endless marketplace, read customer reviews and buy everything from tires to baby toys with just one click. For similar retailers like Woolworths or K-Mart, this kind of convenience is hard to compete with. A third way to achieve oversubscription is to provide the cheaper option. For a successful example of this, you can follow the methods of UNIQLO. This global clothing company was able to sell quality clothes at a low price by making exclusive deals with suppliers. This allows it to buy fabrics at wholesale prices and pass the savings on to the customer. In the next blink, we’ll look at ways of growing your customer base without breaking the bank. Which sounds more desirable to you: a book that all your friends are reading and enjoying or a book that is constantly being advertised on TV, at the movies, on the subway and online? Generally speaking, people respond more positively when products aren’t being aggressively pitched to them. Think of those street vendors who spend all day shouting at passersby about how much of a bargain their products are. How many of these street vendors have you purchased from? Now, think about a place like Gallery Lafayette, a luxury shop in Paris that doesn’t have to spend any time or money on aggressive ads. At this shop, there’s an exclusive Chanel counter where one customer at a time can buy the latest handbag. Naturally, this means there’s always a long line, but people happily stand in it for a chance to get a moment of special treatment at the counter. Offering this kind of exclusive, one-on-one service can make people feel special, which is another powerful way to acquire loyal customers. At the Gallery Lafayette, the long line doesn’t just broadcast the shop’s popularity; it also generates excitement and makes people curious about the tailored treatment that a wait in line will lead to. If someone’s never experienced it before, they’ll keep imagining what it’s like to get one-on-one attention until they eventually become a customer. When you provide a great customer experience, you’ll then be able to use a questionnaire to gather customer stories you can use as testimonials that will grow your customer base even more. A great way to do this is to ask your customers the right questions, such as: How did our products or service change your life for the better? Once you have a story, you can pass it along to potential customers through social media or even get the satisfied customer to agree to make a YouTube video. When others hear the story, they’ll be rushing to be the next in line. Everyone likes to think of themselves as independent thinkers – as people who make their own unique and meaningful decisions. But the truth is, we’re all heavily influenced by what those around us are saying and doing, and any long-lasting, successful company will try to use this to its advantage. Nowadays, this means going beyond traditional advertisements. It’s not enough to put an ad in a magazine that says, “Our high-quality cameras take brilliant photographs” – because anyone with an internet connection can simply go online and compare your camera against every other camera on the market. And, immediately, the customer reviews are going to be more important than whatever slogans you’ve thought up for your ad. Since buyers now have expert reviews and a wealth of customer options to sort through, the best thing you can do is get other people talking about your product or service. Once you begin to get honest, glowing reviews from customers, you’ll be on the way to renown as a reliable, trustworthy brand. These days, getting people talking about your business on social media, YouTube and other online publications is the ultimate marketing tool. This is because customers place far more trust in other customers than in corporate slogans and catchy jingles. And this is a good thing since people are happy to talk about the things they like and it doesn’t cost anything for a happy customer to post a glowing review on Twitter with your company name as the hashtag. Once you get those priceless tweets and start to be known as a trustworthy brand, it’ll be easy to expand into other products, services and platforms. If your underground music blog builds up a loyal following, you can then start a podcast or a YouTube channel and feel comfortable that people will recognize your brand and continue to trust it. After this successful expansion, you could then go on to start a music label and people would expect that your expert taste would carry over into releasing quality music. In the next blink, we’ll take a closer look at how to get your customers excited. There’s a good reason that the collectables industry is worth billions of dollars: people love to have one-of-a-kind items and are excited to own something that only a few others have even touched. Your business can tap into this kind of excitement and build up valuable anticipation through what’s known as business-to-customer signaling. This is a way of giving your customers a heads-up and letting them know that something special and unique is about to happen, like the release of a new limited-edition product. One business that’s great at building up hype on a regular basis is the Glastonbury Music Festival in England. Year-round, people can sign up for updates and a chance to get advance tickets to its annual three-day outdoor concert. Every year, the lineup of musicians is expertly teased, building-up excitement until, finally, 350,000 subscribers are frantically trying to buy 120,000 early-bird tickets that sell out in minutes. This is a very literal example of oversubscription in action, and it’s greatly helped by expert signaling that gets customers jumping at the chance to be part of something unique and limited. Signaling also works the other way around, with potential customers telling the business what they’re excited about. By giving people the opportunity to receive updates on different products, you’ll soon find out which ones they’re most interested in. This works for your business by providing valuable customer insight as well as a good idea of future sales, and the updates will benefit the customer by giving them advanced notice on when they should have their money ready. So, as you can see, offering customers a chance to subscribe for updates is a win-win. The business engages with customers, strengthening their relationship with them and building up excitement for future releases; and the customers get to feel special by getting advance notice on the exact things they’re interested in. In the final blink, we’ll look at more valuable ways of engaging with your customers. Once your customers are subscribed, it’s like having a captive audience, and what you do with that audience will determine how successful you’ll be. Sending out a regular newsletter is a great way to engage with your customers and keep them loyal, but you have to have the right kind of content to keep them engaged. You could send out funny notices with silly gifs and jokes, but the better route is to send valuable information that also teaches and continues to demonstrate your expertise. Chances are your customers are busy and don’t want to waste time. So, if your newsletter doesn’t provide valuable information, they may quickly end up putting your emails in the trash or tagging them as spam. It’s important to remember how much time most people spend researching before they buy something, especially when it’s a big item. For things like cars or deciding where to go on vacation, people spend an average of seven hours researching online before making a purchase. Through a newsletter or blog, you can be an important part of that research time by providing statistics, how-to-guides, expert insight and other valuable information. The more time you can engage a potential customer, the more likely they’ll be to use your product or service when the time comes. Information can be entertaining as well. If you’re providing a car-share service, your blog or newsletter might contain a funny YouTube video that also provides information on how car sharing is good for the environment. So keeping customers engaged and entertained is good for everyone, but it’s best to focus on providing either information or laughs. Otherwise, customers may get confused. A good rule of thumb is the 80-20 Rule: Imagine you’re providing an in-store workshop to raise the profile of your business in the local community. During the workshop you might tell a couple jokes, but the comedy shouldn’t take up more than 20 percent of the time. If people wanted jokes, they’d go see a stand-up comedian. The same rule should apply to your content. People should know what to expect and look forward to. Remember, your goal is to create a strong and easily identifiable brand, not to keep people guessing. So, now that you know some of the secrets to success, it’s time to get people talking about your business! The key message in this book: Scarcity is a good thing! When customers see your products or services as being exclusive and limited, they’ll want them even more. One way to distinguish your business is to offer something that no one else offers – whether it’s exceptional convenience, unbeatable prices or innovative products. To hold on to your customers and build strong relationships, keep them engaged with valuable content so that they’ll keep you in mind and continue to enjoy your products and services. Actionable advice: Here’s an exercise to find out what’s next for your business: Imagine that money wasn’t an issue and you could do whatever you wanted. Think about what would excite you the most and get you incredibly engaged with your business. Maybe it would be a huge, interactive social-media campaign across multiple platforms. Whatever it is, start thinking about ways you could refine it and make it fit your actual budget. Chances are your customers would also find it fun! Got feedback?

And in a world where competition for jobs or advancement gets fiercer by the minute, peak performance is more crucial than ever. But how do you get there? In these blinks, we look at why optimum performance is more important today than ever before and how you can find the formula for the balance that will get you to the pinnacle of performance. In these blinks, you’ll find out that taking a day off from the gym for rest is more important than we might think; why you should stop multitasking right now; and which routines will get you on your way to peak performance. Just a few decades ago, getting a job was a piece of cake. As long as you stood out from the few people in your geographical area who had also applied for the desired job, you had a good chance of landing it. But today, that’s clearly not the case. At this point, the job market is akin to a full-blown world war. After all, technological innovations have made it possible to do a number of jobs from anywhere on the globe. As a result, the number of people vying for a limited number of jobs has increased, which has made the competition fiercer than ever. To make matters even more difficult, an unprecedented number of people are committing themselves to breaking world records these days, a fact that makes standing out from the pack that much harder. For instance, in 1954, when the British athlete Sir Roger Bannister ran a mile in less than four minutes, lots of people thought his accomplishment represented the outer limits of human performance. But today, more than twenty Americans break that four-minute barrier annually. And finally, computers, robots and other forms of artificial intelligence are putting the squeeze on the job market. Just take the e-commerce and cloud-computing company Amazon, which is making human employees redundant by using technology. Since the firm operates entirely online, there’s no need for cashiers or salespeople; Amazon doesn’t even need to pay rent on, or invest in, storefronts. The rise of this online monolith has naturally resulted in the bankruptcy of some brick-and-mortar competitors, like the bookseller Borders, which previously employed over 35,000 people. To take things to an even higher level, Amazon is now looking into using drones to deliver its products, which may eliminate the need for human workers altogether. The point is, machines are getting smarter every day and coming for an ever-greater percentage of jobs. What would you do to get a leg up at work? Well, for many people, intense competition is leading to some desperate measures. In fact, performance-enhancing drugs have become integral to academic, athletic and even professional life. For instance, researchers estimate that 30 percent of students take the “study drug” Adderall, a toned down version of the street drug known as “speed.” Adderall is used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD. But according to the Center for Disease Control, just five to six percent of the population actually suffers from this condition. Most students take this drug to increase their attention span, concentration and focus. Because of these benefits, Kimberly Dennis, an MD and the medical director of a substance abuse center, has seen a marked increase in Adderall use among professionals between the ages of 25 and 45. One person from this age bracket named Elizabeth is the founder of a health-technology company. She told the New York Times that she began taking Adderall because working hard wasn’t enough and the need for sleep was preventing her from putting in longer hours. But it’s not only students and professionals who take such drugs. Around 40 percent of top athletes use banned drugs to increase their performance – and only about two percent of them get caught. Such a performance-at-any-cost way of thinking is, however, unsustainable. In the end, it just results in burnout. For example, a 2014 survey of over 25,000 companies across 90 nations found that the biggest challenge in these firms was overwhelmed employees. This issue has gotten so bad that 21-year-old Moritz Erhardt, an intern at the Bank of America, died of an epileptic seizure brought on by a lack of sleep after working for 72 hours straight. What’s worse is that the people responsible for providing health care to such people are also suffering. Studies show that 57 percent of medical residents and 46 percent of physicians meet the criteria for burnout. We’ve all heard the classic saying “work hard, play hard.” But maybe it’s time to add “rest well” to this adage. After all, giving your body and mind time to rest and recover makes them stronger, which enables you to put in more effort in the future. Just take Deena Kastor, a collegiate runner. She had never won a major race and so, hell-bent on achieving one, she went to train with the legendary coach Joe Vigil. Under his tutelage, she far surpassed her prior levels of success. When asked how she’d done it, she said the major impact was between training sessions – not the training itself. More specifically, Kastor gets 10-12 hours of sleep every night, plans her diet out in great detail and receives a weekly massage and stretching session. Such a rigorous recovery program has enabled incredible growth. So why is rest so crucial? Well, one reason is that suppressing or resisting needs, rest included, is a stressful mental task that makes all others much more difficult. For instance, in the mid-1990s, the social psychologist Roy Baumeister became interested in why people feel tired after approaching a complex problem and why humans run out of willpower in general. To study the question, he got 67 adults together in a room that smelled of freshly baked chocolate chip cookies. Then, the cookies themselves were brought into the room. Half of the people in the room were allowed to eat the cookies, while the other half were told to eat radishes instead. Naturally, for this second group, resisting the cookies was difficult. Then, after both groups had eaten, they were asked to solve a problem that appeared solvable but which was in fact impossible. The radish eaters gave it 19 attempts and gave up in eight minutes; meanwhile, the cookie eaters tried 33 times, committing over 20 minutes to the task. Simply put, the radish eaters had worn out their mental muscles resisting the cookies, while the cookie eaters were still full of energy. In 1934, the endocrinologist Hans Selye did an experiment in which he injected ovarian extracts into rats. The rats reacted strongly, and he believed that he had discovered a new sex hormone. But he soon realized that he was wrong. In reality, the rats reacted exactly the same way to any injection. The experiment just shows that anything that shocks or causes pain and discomfort can trigger stress. Interestingly enough, however, Selye observed that the rats adapted to the stressors over time. In fact, stress can actually be positive and spur growth. A great example is exercise. When you work out a muscle – say, by lifting weights – it causes micro tears in the muscle fibers, triggering a stress response. In effect, the body becomes aware that it’s not strong enough to lift such a weight, and so it transitions into an anabolic stage, building up the muscle to withstand greater stress. And this doesn’t just apply to muscles. Pushing the brain to new heights can also build up its response to stress. For example, in one study, students who were forced to struggle through complex problems without any help outperformed those who received immediate assistance. And managing stress is often merely a matter of how you think about it. If you see it as a positive experience, you’ll be much more able to withstand it. Just take a 2010 study that found that Americans who view stress as “facilitative” have a 43-percent lower chance of dying prematurely. It could be assumed that the only reason such a group views stress favorably is because they rarely experience it. However, when researchers compared the total number of stressful events for this group with those of people who viewed stress negatively, they found that they were nearly identical. The only other explanation is that the attitudes people hold toward stress can determine how it impacts them and, therefore, the length of their lives. Do you love multitasking and consider it the most efficient way to get things done? Well, if you do, it’s time to change your ways. That’s because countless studies have found that both the quality and quantity of work suffers when people do multiple things at once. Just take research from the University of Michigan that found that multitasking can consume up to 40 percent of your productive time. Other research has found that multitaskers are worse at filtering out information, are slower to identify patterns and have diminished long-term memory. A better approach is to do one thing at a time. For example, in the 1990s, the psychologist K. Anders Ericsson began researching how people become experts. To do so, he went to Berlin, Germany, to study violinists at the prestigious Global Music Academy. Ericsson asked each violinist to write a diary of their practice. He then studied the diaries and found that every one of them practiced for 50 hours a week. However, each of them used that time differently. The people who went on to become international soloists spent more time than the lower performers trying to master one specific goal, and they achieved greater focus as a result. Or consider Dr. Bob Kocher, a successful venture capitalist in health care who also works as a health care economist and Stanford professor. How has he accomplished so much? He compartmentalizes. In other words, he divides tasks into categories and gives each activity or goal his singular focus, a practice that can clearly be seen in his daily interactions. The moment you enter a room with Dr. Bob it’s clear that he’s fully with you. He’s entirely undistracted by his email, his phone or anything else. He gives you the same amount of attention as he would the president of the United States, or to any other task or person. Have you ever wondered why so many people have their best ideas while walking, showering or sleeping? It’s in large part because such restful times allow the brain to step out of the linear thought process. After all, when you’re actively working, your conscious mind reigns supreme. It functions in a linear “if-then” kind of way. If this, then that. The issue is, you often fail to solve problems when you get stuck and begin obsessing about them. On the other hand, when you stop trying, your subconscious mind kicks in. This allows your brain to pull random information out of storage, information that was otherwise inaccessible. This is where creativity is born. But rest is also essential to peak performance. Let’s go back to the prior story of that British athlete, Roger Bannister. In 1954, when he set out to run the four-minute mile, he took a new approach. He didn’t push himself up until the last minute before the race. Instead, two weeks before the race, he abandoned training altogether, and set out for the mountains to hike. Compared to his normal routine of constant running, this was more rest than he’d had in a long time. When the big day finally did arrive, he finished the mile in record time. So rest is key, but some forms are better than others. For instance, even the shortest walk can have major benefits as long as you take it in the right locale. This idea is supported by a Stanford study in which participants were asked to take a walk outdoors, indoors or not at all. They were then tasked with coming up with creative uses for a number of common items. Those who’d walked outdoors experienced the most obvious increases in creativity, but even those who’d walked indoors had 40 percent more ideas than those who’d opted to stay put. Whether it’s a writer getting ready to type out a story or an athlete preparing for a race, a great performer will never just hope to be at the top of her game. Instead, she’ll actively cultivate an environment that will help her do her best. That’s why having a solid routine is paramount. Just take Matt Billingslea, the drummer for pop star Taylor Swift. Before every sold-out show, he takes 30 minutes to hop rhythmically from side to side. He then does some exercises, making wide circles with his arms and activating his core and back muscles. Finally, he shifts his focus to his mind, taking deep breaths and visualizing each move while getting into the zone. This routine helps Billingslea stay focused and perform at a top level, despite the pressure of playing in front of hundreds of thousands of people. But a routine isn’t the only way you can reach peak performance. Setting the right priorities can also help. Just take Michael Joyner, a physician and researcher at the Mayo Clinic. He’s published 350 articles on human performance and has a few performance secrets of his own. First, by living close to his workplace he saves time on his commute. Second, he pre-packs his gym bag so he doesn’t waste time picking out workout clothes. And finally, he reserves his energy and willpower for activities that add value, such as a difficult work task that requires complete focus. So it’s important to set yourself up by establishing the proper routines and priorities. Finally, there’s one more trick to peak performance: your mood. For instance, an experiment at Northwestern University gave participants a questionnaire designed to assess their emotional state. The participants were then split into two groups based on their mood. Those with a positive perspective were much more likely to solve challenging intellectual problems. To figure out why, the researchers used an MRI machine to watch the brains of the participants as they solved the problems. They discovered that those with a positive outlook had increased activity in a brain region known as the anterior cingulate cortex, which handles decision-making, emotional control and problem-solving. It’s every kid’s dream to be a superhero with incredible strength and dazzling powers. And, as it turns out, the realization of such a dream might not only belong to science fiction. That’s because fatigue and the physical limits of your body actually only exist in your head. In other words, you’re capable of actions that go beyond your normal abilities. Just consider Tom Boyle, an ordinary American. He and his wife once saw an 18-year-old boy ride his bike head-on into a Chevy Camaro on a suburban road in Tucson, Arizona. They sped to the scene and Tom immediately set to work lifting the front end of the car with his bare hands, freeing the boy’s legs in the process. When the boy still couldn’t get clear of the car due to his injury, Boyle screamed to the driver to drag the boy free. In other words, Boyle broke the Olympic deadlift record even though there was nothing physically extraordinary about him. He was just a simple paint-shop supervisor whose drive to save a young boy gave him superhuman strength. What’s more amazing is that you can draw on such an ability regularly by finding a purpose that transcends yourself. For example, University of Michigan public-health professor Victor Strecher had a daughter named Julia. Julia suffered from heart trouble and eventually required two transplants. Every time his daughter’s health suffered, Strecher was reminded of the value of life and was driven to make the most of his time with her. When, on her nineteenth birthday, she passed away, Strecher entered the bleakest period in his life. This deep melancholy finally broke on Father’s Day when he hallucinated his deceased daughter telling him to move forward. This inspired him to shift his research to understanding the power of purpose, a decision that led to his becoming one of the best teachers in his field. To what does he attribute his success? He says he sees his daughter’s face in every student and teaches them as if they were Julia. And if that’s not a prime example of the power of purpose, it’d be hard to say what is. The key message in this book: Improving your performance isn’t a simple matter of working as hard as you can. In fact, to truly be as productive as possible, and avoid burning out in the process, you’ve got to take care of yourself, focus on one task at a time, identify your purpose and know what truly compels you.  Actionable advice: Help yourself by helping others. Assisting other people activates the reward and pleasure centers of your brain. In other words, lending someone a hand will not only make you feel better; it will also help you associate positive emotions with this act of generosity.

The answer is obvious: great technology. Wrong! In Peopleware, authors Tom DeMarco and Timothy Lister make the case that the most important aspect of software development is actually human, and not technical. You’ll discover that understanding the role of people in software development is crucial. This means that as a project manager, you’ll need to focus on issues such as teamwork, developer productivity and group dynamics; only then can you lead your development team toward success. In the following blinks, you’ll discover why team spirit requires a margin for error; why forced overtime leads to compensatory undertime; and how gardening can set an amicable tone among employees. Work done in the field of creative software development is largely project-based. Yet unfortunately, many of these projects crash and burn with many a manager scratching her head as to why. Indeed, companies undertake countless projects that are doomed to failure. In studies that looked at some 500 different software development projects from real companies, the authors observed that 15 percent of projects were either canceled or never ended up being used. Moreover, for larger and more time-consuming projects, specifically those that lasted 25 or more work-years, 25 percent remained incomplete. In studying these failed projects, the authors found that they couldn’t be explained by failures in technology. In fact, the majority of failed projects had no technological problems at all. Rather, the reasons for failure were sociological – that is, they involved the teams that worked on the projects. Unfortunately, most managers don’t address this aspect of project management, because of an erroneous understanding of their role in the business. To illustrate this, imagine you’re a manager out with your team of programmers at a cocktail party, and another party-goer asks you what you “do for a living.” How do you respond? If you answer, “I’m in software programming,” then you’ve already got it wrong! Managers, even those who manage teams that do technological work, are mostly in the human communication business. Their success, therefore, is derived from positive human interactions within their teams. Managers who don’t understand this central aspect of their job are more likely to manage inefficiently and make their workers unhappy, and thereby diminish the quality of their work. Thus, if you want to be a successful project manager – even in a highly technical field such as software development – you have to place a strong focus on people, not technology, management. The fact that so few managers don’t really understand the purpose of their position is made evident by the several common mistakes managers make when managing their team. First, they see their workers only as being cogs in a machine – essentially interchangeable and uniform, and don’t recognize the unique differences between employees. For example, in one study the authors came across a case of a “less perceptive” manager at a software company. This manager oversaw a very talented employee with an unusual expense account. The manager found that this employee was spending 50 percent more money on food than other workers. However, he wasn’t spending more money overall; whatever extra money he spent on food, he was saving somewhere else. Thus, he wasn’t actually more expensive, just different. Nevertheless, the manager felt threatened and branded the employee as a “food criminal” in a public memo. This lack of consideration for human differences can only lead to poor morale! The second big mistake managers make is that they don’t leave room for employees to make mistakes. Managers often perceive errors as seriously grave, a mind-set that they then pass on to employees as well. For example, when the authors introduced a group of software managers to the concept of iterative design, most felt their bosses wouldn’t accept this new strategy. Iterative design involves rejecting defect-prone designs and starting fresh; the employees believed that, since their manager wouldn’t suffer errors, that this new design strategy would be a tough sell. Even though repairing older versions of defective software is often more costly in the long run, the manager would nonetheless not want to reject a design entirely, as the company had already paid for the time and labor it took to build it. As a result, employees are less likely to try innovative designs out of fear that they might turn out badly, opting instead to play it safe to avoid possible repercussions. This too can cause morale to suffer. Managers want to get the most out of their employees. But what’s the best way to go about it? A manager can always try to make employees work longer hours, and perhaps spend a weekend at the office, right? While this is often a manager’s prefered strategy, it’s actually counterproductive. We are all keenly aware of our limited time here on this earth. Despite being told to “work harder,” we see the toll that this increased workload takes on our families. Our loved ones don’t like it when we spend long hours at the office, and we end up missing out on a lot of quality time. As a result, overtime will often lead employees to take compensatory undertime whenever possible, either through suboptimal work, leaving early, getting sick and so on. In essence, overtime is like sprinting: it’s great for the final stretch, but if you sprint for too long, you won’t be able to finish the race. What’s more, too much mandatory overtime can also lead to higher employee turnover. The decreased job satisfaction that comes with overtime often causes employees to leave the company in search of better working conditions. Take the “Eagle Project” at Data General as an example. During the project, “workaholic project members” put in lots of unpaid overtime hours to get things done, and other employees followed suit as to not look bad. However, after the project’s completion, the entire development staff quit! When measuring productivity, you have to think in terms of benefit divided by cost: if you stand to benefit from savings due to unpaid overtime, then you should also consider the cost of replacing worn-out employees when you calculate productivity Think about a project that was dear to you. Perhaps it was a picture you drew as a child, or maybe an essay that you wanted to get just right. Whatever it was, you would have surely been upset if someone came along and yanked the project from your desk, when you were only halfway finished! These days, lots of employees feel the same way about their own projects. For example, buyers can often live with a program with minor errors, as long as the program is functional. Even if some buyers choose not to buy, such products often remain profitable as programmers have saved money during production, by cutting down the time-to-market. This willingness to accept a decrease in quality for similar decrease in time-to-market is called the flight from excellence. While it does bring the immediate benefit of a faster time-to-market, it comes with a hidden cost. While managers and customers might be okay with a lower-quality product, great computer programmers would rather create programs they can take pride in. If they’re constantly pressured to build lower-quality products quickly, they’ll become unhappy and eventually quit their job. You, as a manager, are then stuck looking for a replacement. In contrast, workers that are happy with their work will also be more productive in the long run. Consider Hewlett-Packard, a company famous for its high quality standards, set by employees who actually build the programs. It’s no surprise that the company is also famous for its productivity. HP programmers deliver quality beyond what the market requires. As a result, employees identify strongly with their work, as well as enjoy high job satisfaction, and the company in turn enjoys low turnover. This helps HP to stay profitable, showing that quality and productivity are not tradeoffs, but can be two sides of the same coin. Creating good work, however, starts with having the right environment. The following blinks will show how to create a work environment that’s actually conducive to work. Think about your office: Are the phones constantly ringing? Are people up and about? Are there just too many distractions to get things done? If this sounds familiar, then it might be time to change your office setup so that your employees can feel more at ease and actually get some work done. The workplace has by far the greatest impact on worker performance – higher than even education or experience. The authors verified this during their “Coding War Games,” which aimed to measure productivity among different companies. Each company involved in the games nominated two employees to participate, and each two-person team was tasked with coding and testing a medium-sized program, and was to log the time spent on their work, which could only be done during normal working hours. The authors then measured whether factors such as programming language, years of experience, salary and workplace had an effect on the time competitors needed to complete their task. The result: workplace, far greater than programming language, experience and even salary, had the greatest impact on worker performance. This all leaves us wondering: How do effective workplaces differ from ineffective ones? Essentially, effective workplaces are bigger, quieter and have fewer interruptions. The workers who performed in the study’s top quartile had more space for their work, an average of 78 square feet. Within this group: 57 percent said that their workspace was acceptably quiet; 62 percent reported that it was acceptably private; 52 percent were allowed to silence their phones; 76 percent were able to divert their calls; and only 38 percent reported being needlessly interrupted. Contrast this with the workers in the bottom quartile, who had only 46 square feet worth of working space, and 76 percent of whom were often interrupted. Can you remember the last time you were so engrossed in a task that your work felt like the most simple, natural thing in the world? This feeling that creative workers get when they are truly immersed in their work is called flow, defined as a “condition of deep, nearly meditative involvement” with a gentle sense of euphoria, and it’s essential in doing our best work. Flow comes with a deep concentration that helps us work better, faster and with more enthusiasm, making it especially important for creative work. Despite flow’s critical importance, we don’t often give it the respect it deserves. Think about it: when we measure productivity, we’re often measuring body time, that is, the time in which people are physically present at work. That says nothing about the brain time they actually put in, or the time spent in flow. If your employees measure the hours they spend working in flow, the result will inevitably be smaller than their body time, since flow is destroyed by interruptions. So, you need a way to enable flow. One way is to ensure that your office has doors for privacy and phones that can be silenced. Telephones are noisy, demand attention and thus interrupt flow. So, by encouraging your workers to quiet their phones for hours at a time, you allow them to spend more time in a flow state and thus be more productive. You’ll also need to arrange the workspace in a way that allows both private space with a door, meeting space and social space, thus enabling your employees to both work in solitude or interact with one another. One manager interviewed by the authors recalls his time at Bell Labs, where he worked in a spacious two-person office and was allowed to turn off his phone. His colleague sometimes would sit at his desk, immersed in thought – something which wouldn’t have been possible with the hustle and bustle of a normal office. Surely you’ve heard stories about what it’s like to work at Google. The company has a reputation for creating a pleasant, fun and unique working environment that delights employees. But there’s a reason Google tries so hard to keep its employees happy. As a manager, you should strive to maintain a mentality of permanence. This means you should be proactive in keeping your personnel for as long as possible, by fostering a sense of community among workers and investing in them over the long term. For example, as a manager, you should be consciously striving to be the best in your own field and discuss your determination with your team to create a unified vision. You should also foster community activities unrelated to work, to further create a shared sense of community. The magazine Reader’s Digest, for example, did this by setting up community gardens for employees, and found that gardening together created an amicable atmosphere within the company. By taking an interest in their workers’ well-being and investing in them for the long term, companies increase their chances of keeping workers over longer periods. But why would companies even want to do this? In essence, turnover costs are very expensive, so you might as well avoid them. Think about it: if the average employee works at your company from somewhere between 15 and 36 months, then you’ll typically lose between 33 and 80 percent of your workforce every year to turnover. Now consider that it costs around 1.5 months’ salary to onboard a new employee, and until he’s up to speed on how things work, you can expect a few months of negative output, both from him and those that have to take time away from their work to help him find his bearings. This adds up: all in all, the authors estimate that 20 percent of all manpower expenses are turnover costs. Now that you know how to create a great working environment, our final blinks will show you how to assemble your “wonder team.” If you’ve ever worked in a team in which everyone and everything just “clicked,” then you know just how pleasant as well as productive these kinds of environments can be. As a manager, it’s your responsibility to ensure nothing comes in the way of encouraging this sort of positive team atmosphere. One particular problem that can arise, however, is when managers work to protect themselves from their team’s failures. This sort of strategy is called defensive management, and it almost always backfires. The author recalls an anecdote about a consultant, who noticed that his project group wasn’t asking for feedback from one of their clients. The problem wasn’t the team but rather their manager, who insisted on communicating with the client himself. The manager, however, was so swamped by his own work that he simply didn’t have the time to get to the client’s feedback. His lack of trust in his team regarding client interactions resulted in a loss in efficiency, and in the end, certainly didn’t protect him from his team’s failures! Another problem is bureaucracy, which is both time-consuming and detrimental to team solidarity. In fact, studies show that bureaucracy, like a complicated filing system or the overly extensive documentation of work processes, accounts for as much as 30 percent of a product’s production costs. Bureaucracy itself does little to advance projects, as it mostly just documents work that has already been done. If you want your team to “click,” then they have to rally behind your cause, and it’s hard to motivate them to do that when they’re filing papers all the time. No two workers are the same, and as such, no two are equally skilled at any given task. However, this shouldn’t be taken to mean that less-skilled team members bring down the group. Rather, a team’s success depends less on individual skill and more on priorities. If a team prioritizes quality, then employees will eventually create a team that is greater than the sum of its parts. For example, you may have heard the popular tale about a company which consistently had a problem with software errors, or “bugs,” that had proved elusive for programmers to remove. Then a team of skilled software testers was formed, which became known as the Black Team. After a year, the Black Team developed a personality of its own: the group placed heavy emphasis on product quality and tried to develop the hardest tests imaginable for software in development. It got to the point where presenting your code to the Black Team was frightening, because of their high standards! The Black Team accomplished two things: the team itself improved programs by detecting and removing bugs, and the other programmers tried to write the best possible programs to pass muster. When the initial Black Team members were replaced by new employees, the recruits almost immediately adopted the attitudes and spirit of the Black Team. Eventually, none of its initial members remained, yet the Black Team – driven by a shared vision for quality – still continued to perform well. Another force that binds teams together is a shared sense of eliteness. Members of the Black Team started wearing black clothes, and made a point of coming up with more punishing, outrageous tests for software to boost their sense of eliteness. They enjoyed their work so much that other employees even became envious of them. As a result, members of the Black Team felt it was an honor to be on the team, which only increased their sense of solidarity. Would you rather work in a place where you can be yourself, or in one where you feel like you have to fit into a mold? Unless you are a robot, individuality is important. It’s no different with your project teams. Indeed, heterogeneity is crucial for team building. In part, having a diverse team signals to your employees that it’s okay to be different, to think differently and to come up with unique ideas and solutions. For example, when your team includes a co-op student, an ex-admin and a handicapped developer, their differences signal that everyone has a role and is important, and that aspiring to be a “corporate mold of Uniform Plastic Person” is not what your company is about. This ability to express individuality is important not only for worker happiness but also in forming a cohesive team. The members of this heterogenous team, just like all other human beings, will need the feeling of accomplishment from time to time. You should accommodate this by structuring work into manageable chunks. Think about it: If you’re working on a project that will take four years to complete without recognizing any of the successes along the way, chances are you might think, “I could be dead before this thing is ever done!” This feeling is not motivating, especially if team members meet regularly. Thus, it’s important for them to celebrate the small successes along the way. This will get them into the habit of succeeding together, which will build momentum and help increase camaraderie. Not only that, but celebrating the completion of each piece of a project will give team members renewed energy to take the next steps. Now that you’ve finished these blinks, it’s time to take a moment to celebrate your next step on the path to becoming a great project manager! The key message in this book: The best project managers don’t manage technology or even the project itself. Instead, they manage people! Project managers need to treat employees as individuals and help them to form great teams, so a company can get the best work out of them. Actionable advice: Turn off your phone, and have your team do the same. The next time you have to get some important work done, disconnect your telephone. Working without interruptions can help you get into a flow state, which will help you to get more things done and get more enjoyment out of work.

We all know the feeling: you’re stuck in a rut in your job, but you’re too scared to switch things up and get out. After all, it might well put your finances at risk. Perhaps your family and friends have expressed concern at your desire to change tracks. They might even say it’s some sort of age-related crisis. But guess what? It’s perfectly normal for you to feel that way. These days, it’s quite normal to have multiple careers. Few people stay at the same company for their entire working lives before retiring – things just don’t work that way anymore. In fact, the average American employee stays in one position for just four to five years. Adam Chaloeicheep is a case in point. Chaloeicheep was once creative director of a real estate development company in Chicago, but, burnt out, he left his job and headed off to Thailand to study meditation. Eight months later he was back. His mind was clear. His passions for fashion, technology, entrepreneurship and brand strategy would now guide him. He went back to school to broaden his skill set and then started his own company, ABC Design Lab. Fulfillment and financial success followed soon after. Yes, Chaloeicheep’s story is a little on the extreme side. But it’s indicative of a broader trend. A recent Gallup poll showed that up to 90 percent of employees are either “not engaged” or “actively disengaged” from their jobs. It’s no great surprise, then, that people are on the lookout for new opportunities. Crises that make you look elsewhere are in no way voluntary. But you can use that same outward-looking mentality to make a deliberate career shift in a new direction. It’s known as a career pivot, and to do it, you don’t even have to leave your current employer. Let’s take Amy Schonberger as an example. She felt stuck as a senior creative strategist in a public relations firm, but she wasn’t ready to ditch just yet. Rather than looking for new jobs, Schonberger started taking responsibility for social media and blogging. Her coworkers weren’t interested themselves. They felt working in social media would damage their reputations. But Schonberger knew better, and before long, she found herself dealing with the company’s biggest clients. Her status as a social media expert soon led to her appointment to a new, official role: director of digital entertainment. Pivoting isn’t something you do without planning though. Let’s look now at all the stages along the way. It makes no difference whether you want to found a company or if you want to take on a new role at your current firm – change can be overwhelming. However, you can make things easier by zooming out to get the big picture and thinking about how you want to plant your pivot. There’s no need to get tangled up in the hows and whens of your pivot just yet. First of all, establish your vision: think carefully about what your broader values are. The author once had a client, Justin, who was sick of working for his family’s real estate business. Instead of delving into the issues of what Justin should do, the author’s first step was to identify Justin's values and status. Through their discussions, they determined that the most important factors for Justin were his health, financial security, environment and relationships with like-minded people. Based on this information, they were able to discuss Justin’s career options together. Within a few months, Justin had been accepted to a business school in San Diego on a scholarship. There, he was able to meet new and inspiring friends, in a place that offered an inspiring and healthy environment. The trick is to keep the focus of your dreams tight. Don’t start thinking long-term and in generalities; instead, define a pivot vision based on your values for the next couple of years. Consider the author’s sister-in-law, Gillian. One day, while on the conveyor-belt career path that would make her a lawyer, she realized she wanted to get off. She didn’t want to spend the year after law school writing legal documents  – she wanted to become more engaged. She needed an environment in which she could be flexible and physically active, and in which she could interact with like-minded peers. Perhaps most of all, she wanted to start a business and a family with her husband. Gillian had been taking a CorePower Yoga Teacher Training course at the time. Soon after starting, yoga had become central to her happiness. Even though she passed the bar, she decided to quit her position at the law firm to teach at a yoga studio and get involved in the yoga business. She was able to utilize her unique background to her advantage, and soon had a managerial position at the studio. This work left her feeling far more fulfilled than she would ever have been as a lawyer. The lesson here is clear: if you clearly define your values and your vision, you’ll be more equipped for large-scale changes. You’ll know just what to do when those daunting decisions inevitably come up. Thinking about making a change to your career is almost sure to stoke anxiety. It would for anyone. After all, you’ll be starting from scratch and losing your current regular paycheck. To deal with this fear while you’re planting your pivot, you’ll need to evaluate your current situation; this is the second part of planting. It implies considering how your current strengths will help you move on and up. The result is that you won’t be starting over with a blank slate, as you’ll know exactly where your strengths lie. Ask yourself: Are there any specific challenges I’m attracted to? What energizes me? Sometimes, your career portfolio can provide the answer. Other times, you might have to look back a bit. Take Jason Shen. He began in content marketing, but took up a product manager position at a start-up. As he was transitioning into his new role, he found an end-of-the-year evaluation from his kindergarten years hidden among old documents at home. In it his teacher had written, “He especially enjoys computer work, games and making things.” It was confirmation that his interest in computers and building had been there from the start. And what’s more, it gave him a huge boost of confidence: he realized that he wasn’t some hanger-on to Silicon Valley culture. He now knew that his new position was sure to play to the strengths he had had his entire life. You can also decrease the stress involved in change by obtaining a better understanding of your financial situation. That way, you’ll know when you can afford to take a big risk and – just as critically – when you can’t. Let’s look at Andrew Deffley. When he turned 30, Deffley decided to transition away from being a production manager at NFL Films, where he’d been for eight years. He wanted to fulfil his lifelong dream and become an actor, but he knew he couldn’t go into it blindly. He had to take stock of his financial situation and come up with a plan. First, he would save enough so that he could take a six-month break from NFL Films. He could use that time to see if acting was the right thing for him. Then, if he still wasn’t earning enough from acting alone after six months, he would start up a side hustle of production-related work. That way, he could continue to audition for roles. These side earnings played to Deffley's strengths by using his already-acquired skills. He was able to keep himself financially secure, while simultaneously pivoting toward his dream career with confidence. It worked out well. Since starting, Deffley has landed roles in web series and TV shows including I Love Ryan? and Orange is the New Black. Once you’ve got a good idea of the foundations required for a pivot, then it's time to scan for opportunities. Some people think what’s needed at this stage is a career mentor, someone to dispense expert advice in the long term. But it can be a laborious task finding someone to take on this time-consuming role. But no worries, it’s actually better to work with a series of one-off mentors and experts. In many cases, these advisory sessions morph into longer-term mentorships. The author herself is a case in point. When she was beginning as a career coach and speaker, she didn’t look for a long-term mentor. Instead, she called up Susan Biali, an expert in coaching and speaking, and asked for a one-off conversation. During the call, Biali offered to help her on a regular basis, even suggesting they check in each month. They’ve actually kept in contact to this day. If you think of these conversations as one-off interactions, that’ll park questions relating to long-term mentorship. You won’t feel you’re pushing your mentor for more time in the future. Aside from these one-off mentors, you should also build up a mastermind group of friends and peers with similar interests, who you can ask whenever questions come to mind. Let’s consider Luke Schrotberger. He was a consultant to an Alaskan oil and gas group and he wanted to pivot within his company. Schrotberger reached out to a peer for guidance. He had himself pivoted within the company. Your mastermind group might include friends who have similar goals to you. The author and her friend Alexis Grant are just like this. While they were both writing their books, they made sure to be in daily contact to keep each other on track by sharing experiences with each other. But what do you do when you don’t have friends or colleagues who can help? Thankfully the internet is a savior here. There are loads of sites and communities you can ask. The author believes her own ten-week courses are just the ticket for keeping your momentum up. These courses worked for Lora Koenig, who found a mastermind group thanks to the author’s program. She used them as a support system as she transitioned from product management to agricultural development as a Peace Corps volunteer in rural Ethiopia. However you choose to find your support network, the general lesson is clear: the relationships you foster at the start of your pivot are sure to help you throughout the entire pivoting process. We all know those people who are a bit too passive in their outlook; they sit around waiting for a miracle to happen. If you really want to switch things up, however, you need to actively scan for new breaks. And the most successful pivoters are those who look for opportunities related to their strengths. Consider Shawn Henry. In 1999, he’d been at the FBI for ten years and wanted to transition from his job as a special agent into a supervisory role. However, despite his experience and dedication, Henry found his applications rejected when he applied for four different positions across the agency. Then, he noticed that the position of chief of computer investigations was being advertised. Although Henry had no experience in the FBI’s computer division, he reckoned that he could lead the division in the face of rising digital crime. He felt he could apply the tactics he’d learned as a special agent – such as wiretapping and undercover work – to the digital realm and to the internet. He landed the job. Eventually, Henry worked his way up to becoming executive assistant director, the third-most important position in the FBI, before founding his own cybersecurity start-up, CrowdStrike. And it was all made possible by being proactive and using his strengths to sniff out opportunities. Another way you can create your own opportunities is by doing what’s known as platform-building, which can help make your desired direction known to all. Photographer Daniel Kelleghan is a good example. After quitting his product photography job at Groupon, he was able to shoot the fashion and architecture photos he’d always wanted to. In the meantime, he used corporate gigs to supplement his income. Kelleghan was able to gain a cult following for his photos on Instagram. Thanks to Instagram featuring his work, he was able to hit 100,000 followers almost overnight, which gave him an instant breakthrough. These days, Kelleghan’s platform gives his clients, such as Audi and Warby Parker, a way to get in contact to ask if he can shoot their products. He offers companies the chance to place their products in his Instagram feed, and he especially likes contacting hotels in places he wants to visit. That way, he gets to travel and stay in nice hotels for free. The point is that Kelleghan never stopped creating opportunities. He achieved success through education, hard work and sheer will. Without that, his “lucky break” would never have been possible. You've identified your next big move, and you’ve done it by recognizing your values and finding helpful resources. Now it's time to test out your vision in the third stage of the four-step method: piloting. The idea here is to seek out ways to pilot small-scale versions of your larger vision. That way, you can determine through experimentation whether your pivot is actually something that thrills you. Based on the results, you can adjust your methods according to your strengths and goals. Let’s look at Christian Roberts and Bill Connelly, the improv comedians behind Angry Landlord, a New York comedy show. Angry Landlord began as an experimental collaboration, since the comedians wanted to channel their talents into a new format that would fit with their interests. However, when they looked out from the stage during their third show and saw just eight people in the audience, they knew they’d have to adapt. What was and wasn’t working? What were their strengths?   Then they hit upon the answer: they had to network with comedians and build their brand. As such, they adjusted their approach and started building their social media profile. Before too long, they were posting short YouTube videos and expanding their network of comedians. Thanks to these efforts, Angry Landlord has been a sellout show ever since. Sometimes you should pilot in stages, which means incrementally increasing the risk in your experiments. That way, you don’t enact new changes all at once. Bob Gower did this. He’s a business consultant for Fortune 100 companies but was once working on developing a beginners' bondage course for couples. Gower set up a series of pilots to test his idea. However, he used the pseudonym Ryan White so as to keep the hustle separate from his day job. Instead of going all-in with a huge investment in the project, Gower continued his consulting. He thought that if enough people were interested in the Facebook group and the free PDF guide to basic bondage he’d written, he’d see it as an indication that there would also be interest in an e-book. And then, if his e-book was successful, he’d work on developing an online course. However, the experiments turned out differently than he expected. Gower still liked the project, but realized there wasn’t any point expanding it into a full-time gig. It wasn’t a waste of time, though. He was able to use his real-life stories about his bondage business endeavor in his consulting work. Not only did it give him an edge, it also made him seem authentic. Maybe you, like Gower, will find that your piloting will take you down a different path from the one you first envisaged. Once you’ve evaluated your values for planting your pivot, scanned for opportunities and connections and piloted your putative move, the only thing left to do is launch. But for some people, fear of failure can keep them from actualizing their pivot in the first place. Don’t get caught in this trap. Identify specific launch criteria to determine when to set your plan in action. You’ll need to engage in some basic troubleshooting and be prepared. Using launch criteria worked for Tom Meitner. Meitner worked answering customer service emails. His wife, Amanda, did the same job but on a different shift. They never had the chance to see each other. Meitner knew he was overqualified for his job and decided to write to 300 companies and offer his services as a copywriter. Meitner reckoned that a benchmark of success would be earning $2,500 a month freelancing. If he hit that figure, he would know he could launch properly. Within three weeks he had already made $3,000. Soon enough, he found himself in a position where he could take on more interesting work, instead of just anything he could get his hands on. Not long after that, he was able to raise his rates, and was making a six figure sum each year – all while working mostly at home. Meitner’s launch criterium was a financial benchmark, but yours needn’t be. It could also be a specific date, a milestone, an indication of external approval – such as acceptance to grad school – or even a gut feeling. More often than not, the anxieties involved in launching are rooted in a fear of failure. Just remember, though, that a good pivot also involves diverging from an original concept, especially if it’s clear that things aren’t going to plan. That’s not failure – that’s adaptation. Take Christian and John. They pivoted from their jobs as commodities traders and began SpringUps, an urban farming business. Even though the start-up was proving to be profitable after a year, it was clear that the project wasn’t going to be the cash cow they’d hoped. It wasn’t enough even to secure the financial future that was so important to them both. Consequently, they sold the company and parted ways – but they were able to bounce back. Rather than going back to trading, John landed a job at a predictive analytics startup. Christian, on the other hand, took a job in sales at a technology company. Ultimately, failures are just opportunities for another pivot. And if you feel stuck then just go back to those first three steps: plant, scan and pilot. And that’s how you pivot! What’s so great about the pivot method is that its usages aren’t limited to those pivoting into new careers. In fact, managers can employ it within their own companies. Although managers rarely discuss career mobility with their employees, a recent Inc. survey found that 51 percent of CEOs identified their biggest challenge as \"attracting and retaining skilled employees.\" If you're a manager, it's up to you to begin talking to your employees about pivoting. That’s how you keep good staff. Let’s consider Courtney John-Reader, an employee at an architectural firm. John-Reader felt she’d run her course as a digital communications coordinator at the company. Although she liked her projects as well as the company’s work, she felt she wasn’t valued enough, no matter how hard she worked. In the end, she quit. Sadly, John-Reader’s feelings are common among staff. As a manager, it’s your responsibility to promote and communicate a culture of mobility and recognition. But don’t discuss with your employees what they could or should being doing. Instead, use the basics of the pivot method: lead open-ended discussions using the simple question, \"what's next?\" On top of those efforts in leading a general discussion, you should offer real opportunities for your employees. Take the business and analytics software company SAS. SAS’s motto is “Pursue Growth and Learning.” It’s therefore keen on helping its employees reach their professional and personal goals. Consequently, the company offers business tools, equipment for hire, research resources and over 16,000 books, all with that aim in mind. You can also offer career programs to your employees. The supermarket chain Whole Foods does just this. It has job-specific certification programs that its employees can take, such as the training for the American Cheese Society’s Certified Professional Exam. These programs mean Whole Foods employees can gain skills and pivot to work in specialist sections within the company’s supermarkets. Just remember: be creative! It’s your aim to foster an environment where employees neither stagnate nor quit. It’s up to you to provide opportunities for them to pivot internally based on their skills and interests. In the end, it will be the company that benefits. The key message in these blinks: When seeking a career shift, begin by identifying your values, strengths and situation. If you then take small steps toward your goal and run experiments to test your way, pivoting can become not only manageable, but a way to keep your career exciting and dynamic. In today's job climate, pivoting provides you with the mentality you need to adapt to your surroundings, while fostering connections and opportunities. Actionable advice: Define your project-based purpose. When thinking about career motivations, we’re often encouraged to think of an all-encompassing purpose for our lives. Instead of thinking in such daunting terms, define a project-based purpose based on your values and what you want to accomplish. If you’re a teacher, perhaps you have a long-term purpose of contributing to the well-being and happiness of your students. With that in mind, you might create a project-based purpose of organizing fun and creative after-school activities. This project-based purpose will allow you to see more immediate results of your goals. If you get stuck defining your project-purpose, think about what impact you want to have on your friends, your family, your community, or society at large! Got feedback?

According to Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, his coffee deli became so hugely popular because it has always had extremely high standards for their products and work environment. The story about Starbucks shows that the success of a business depends on the authenticity of its product, and that trust, brand renewal and strong principles are essential to keep a business growing. In these blinks you’ll learn how low fat milk threatened Starbucks’ very high standards; why spending more than you have might actually not be such a bad idea; and how an experiment in 1988 made coffee-flavoured ice cream possible. If you bring up Starbucks in conversation, chances are pretty much everyone will know what you’re talking about. You know Starbucks as a successful business, but have you ever wondered how it came to be? The secret to Starbucks’ success is, for founder Howard Schultz, no secret at all. Plain and simple, the success of Starbucks lies with the brand’s authenticity, achieved by selling only the highest quality coffee. Back in 1981, Starbucks was just a small retail store. It sold exclusively dark-roasted Italian style coffee, which may be ubiquitous today, but was still a novelty back then. By roasting the coffee dark, the coffee grows in strength, gains a more powerful aroma and has the distinct taste of authentic Italian coffee. Starbucks never compromised its beans, and became known for its premium-quality, dark-roasted flavor profile that its founders were so passionate about. Because of those early business decisions, Starbucks had an undeniable feeling of authenticity about it since the start. The company has held true to its authentic coffee profile, in tough times to the present day. In 1994, coffee prices shot to an all-time high on the world market, from $0.80 to $2.74 in a matter of days, after a frost that destroyed much of Brazil’s coffee plants. During this coffee crisis, a lot of shareholders promoted the purchase of cheaper beans, to keep the price of a cup of joe stable. But Starbucks was unwilling to compromise quality and continued to sell the highest quality coffee they could, instead reducing other costs to account for the higher price of beans. When the world coffee market recovered, Starbucks had an even stronger customer base because its quality remained consistently high. From what we’ve learned in the first blink, Starbucks adheres to uncompromising business practices. So what kind of person does that make its founder? You could probably describe Howard Schultz as stubborn. In fact, that quality is what led Howard to become a part of Starbucks in the first place. After tasting the great coffee at its store in 1981, Schultz knew he wanted to become head of marketing in the Starbucks retail stores. The original founder, Jerry Baldwin, was interested. But his partners thought Schultz had too many new ideas and was too eager to create change. So Baldwin declined to hire Schultz.   At first, Schultz was devastated. But as he was so determined to join Starbucks, he called back the following day to tell Baldwin he was making a huge mistake. And, after sleeping on it, Baldwin, won over by Schultz’ persistence, offered him the job. Starbucks’ initial reluctance to hire him wasn’t the only obstacle. Later on he took leave from the company due to disagreements about brand development, and opened his own coffee shop, Il Giornale. Raising money for that venture over the course of a year, he pitched to 242 accredited investors. A whopping 217 said no. In the face of rejection, he grew more stubborn. He continued to elicit investors until he was finally able to open Il Giornale. And, his coffee shop eventually became so successful that he bought Starbucks and developed it into a billion dollar company! We can take away two lessons: (1) Business will always present obstacles; (2) A stubborn attitude is key to overcoming those stumbling blocks. Still, there’s much more to success! Read on. We’ve seen that it pays to be stubborn when dealing with people at the top of the food chain. But with everyone else vital to your business, your focus should be entirely different: build a relationship of trust with your employees. The Starbucks management team has worked hard to nurture that trust. It’s reflected in the company motto: “Treat people like family and they will be loyal and give their all.” The Starbucks family receives a great benefit package and even part-time employees are offered stock options – Bean Stock – so they are partners, not just employees. Employees are also encouraged to voice their opinions at the quarterly Open Forums, a source of valuable feedback. As a result, there is a great bond of trust between management and employees. Starbucks workers are in fact so pleased by their company that they have refused to be represented by unions since 1992, making the following statement: “You trusted us, and now we trust you.” It makes sense that if your employees trust you, they’re likely to stay with you longer. But did you know this can also improve your customer bond? For example, Starbucks has a lower turnover rate than other comparable retail stores – up to 65%, compared with up to 400% per year. Low turnover means the business is saving time and money on training new hires. But, it also helps the business in a more personal way. Many regular customers can expect that their baristas will recognize them and greet them with, “Same as usual?” That familiarity gives the customers a strong connection to the Starbucks brand, a connection that keeps them coming back. We can see that for Starbucks, trust is an invaluable commodity. We’ve all got those friends that seem to be changing their values on a whim, chasing the latest fads and trends. If they’re an acquaintance, we’ll tolerate that kind of behavior, but how would you like it if your business was changing its core principles from week to week? Neither employees nor customers would put up with it for very long, which is why it’s crucial that a business stands by its values. As we know, the core value of Starbucks is authenticity. So, taking this principle seriously has sometimes meant denying customer requests. For example, when flavoured coffee beans became available, many customers asked for the ones they could find in other stores. However, Starbucks refuses to produce them to this day, because they don’t want to pollute their high quality coffee beans with flavoring chemicals. This goes to the point where a Starbucks’ employee would grind another company’s beans for you, but they would not grind flavoured coffee beans in their grinders, as some traces of chemicals could be left behind and pollute the other coffee. In this way, values are so important at Starbucks that it’s sometimes necessary to have lengthy discussions on matters that seem, at first, totally trivial. When Starbucks began to receive customer requests for low fat milk, fights broke out. Again, authenticity drives the Starbucks visions, and it was widely considered that a Caffe Latte could only be authentic using whole fat milk. But, on the other hand, another core value at Starbucks and in any sensible business is to fulfill the customers’ wishes. So Starbucks had a dilemma on their hands. Not willing to compromise either value, the company conducted extensive testings on low fat products in order to make sure that the authentic taste would not be sacrificed. The low fat Caffe Latte was introduced only once they were sure it tasted just as good as their original whole fat Caffe Latte. To those who aren’t particularly enthusiastic about coffee, this may seem like a lot of effort for such trifling issues. But you’ve got to admire the way Starbucks fiercely upheld its values as the company grew and changed. And, as we’ll find out in the next blink, there certainly were a lot of changes in store. We all know it’s wise to be cautious with our money, be sparing and only spend what we can afford. But in business, it’s a different game where it’s often necessary to take big risks. The truth is, if you want to be successful, you’ve got to take the plunge and invest. Starbucks’ impressive and rapid growth wouldn’t have been possible if it hadn’t started “investing above the curve,” which means investing in themselves even before they needed it. Today Starbucks has 21,000 stores. But, even when they only had 20, Schultz already knew he wanted to make it big. He soon realized that his investments were most needed in one area: infrastructure. With plans to grow to 300 stores in the near future and to continue roasting its own beans, Starbucks needed roasting facilities that were up to the task. Their current roasting facilities simply wouldn’t stand the test. So, it needed to build a new one. The company also needed to attract a high-performing management team, one that had already worked with huge enterprises, with an ability to handle fast growth. In addition, it needed a sophisticated computer program, custom-built to deal with the company’s thousands of sales in hundreds of places. Altogether, these changes required a large and risky investment. Many investors were concerned by losses between 1987 and 1989, and pressured the business to change strategies. But, it became apparent that the losses were a result of investment that had not yet paid off, and that the storefronts were in fact operating at profit. So once again, Schultz stuck to his guns and the investments paid off over time. By 1990, Starbucks was making a profit and had a firm foundation for further growth. Starbucks wasn’t alone in its early losses. Most companies struggle in their initial phases. But if the reason for your losses is because you are investing above the growth curve, then you can be sure that your company will profit and expand in years to come. That strategy applies to both business plans and people, as the following blink discusses. Let’s face it: we can’t do everything ourselves. Still, superiors often feel threatened by their brightest employees, rather than tapping into their skills as an asset. Schultz, on the other hand, was smart enough to give the reigns to those with expertise in their specific areas. For example, when confronted with the challenge of creating a sales computer program for hundreds of stores, Schultz hired a programmer who had worked on the McDonald’s sales program. Having worked in a company that was far bigger than Starbucks, she was well-suited. Instead of micromanaging her every step of the way, Schultz trusted her, offered her a clean slate and let her develop the Starbucks sales program. That program is still used worldwide today. This shows just how valuable it is to trust that your specialist employees know what they’re talking about; after all, it is their specialty. In 1989, a new manager, Howard Behar, joined Starbucks. He began to rapidly change the corporate culture and openly disagreed about many tactics  – not so dissimilar to Schultz in his early days at Starbucks! At first, working with Behar was uncomfortable for some Starbucks managers. But the clever ones learned to adapt and recognize his criticism for its constructive value. With his help, Starbucks made the shift from a product-oriented company to a company that was centred on people. Behar was responsible for the Open Forums that give Starbucks employees the opportunity to provide their feedback. If management had rejected Behar because they felt threatened by him, they wouldn’t have been able to benefit from his great new ideas, ideas that make Starbucks the successful company it is today. Openness to new ideas isn’t just vital within a company; sometimes new ideas come from other sources, leading to revolutionary collaborations. In the next blink, learn how Starbucks optimized collaboration! If you want to get ahead in business, the old “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” mantra won’t cut it. Brand renewal, on the other hand, will boost your success; the key is to change things before they stop working. Starbucks managed to apply brand renewal to a product as old and traditional as coffee. And, the company applied renewal at a scientific level. Don Valencia, a biomedical scientist, began experimenting with coffee in 1988. His research led him to develop a coffee extract, which he then refined until it was completely indistinguishable from real, freshly-brewed coffee. He took his idea to his local Starbucks shop, where the managers were impressed, as were those higher up in the Starbuck hierarchy. Starbucks onboarded the coffee extract, and Valencia’s invention made it possible to create products such as coffee-flavored ice cream and ready-to-drink bottled beverages. These products could be sold in supermarkets, making Starbucks popular to a wider market. Another way to create brand renewal in your company is by working with another company on a joint venture. In 1994, Starbucks began working with Pepsi to distribute cold coffee drinks, making it possible to sell Starbucks in places where there weren’t any Starbucks stores. But it wasn’t an easy match. At first, the companies couldn’t have been more different: Starbucks was a small business in which people worked on several different projects at once, whereas Pepsi employees were used to focusing on one project at a time. But instead of challenging each other, both companies chose to view these differences as complementary, and with a positive outlook they began to look for win-win solutions. This way, they were able to put the bottled Frappucino on the market, which was so popular that stores were already selling out soon after its release. Having the courage to work with others to renew your product can pay off greatly, and can even propel you to an international market. But as a company expands, it must be true to its founding spirit – the principles behind its success. Starbucks strives to keep its original culture alive, as we’ll see in the next blink. It’s a classic story for big chains to sell their soul in order to stay ahead in the game, but the same isn’t true for Starbucks. Instead, the company takes the initiative to stay intimate with its employees – no easy feat when there are about 25,000! By offering Bean Stock (stock options) Starbucks generates a sense of partnership among its employees. It tends to offer higher hourly wages than the industry standard as well other benefits, such as health insurance for employees and their partners. Schultz communicates personally with each store via email and voicemail, and each region holds quarterly meetings for store managers so that management remains in touch with the base. A survey in 1996 revealed that corporate culture was exceptional: 88% of the employees were satisfied with working at Starbucks and 89% were even proud to work at Starbucks! Not only does Starbucks strive to take care of its employees; it also strives to stand by environmental principles. For example, its disposable paper cups are a predominant environmental issue. Single use disposable paper cups generate an unseemly amount of waste, not to mention that sometimes hot beverages necessitate two cups. While disposable cups continue to be a necessary part of the business, Starbucks developed cup sleeves, so that hot beverages no longer need a double cup. The sleeves are made of half the material as a cup, and protect people’s hands from the heat, just the same. The stores also sell reusable cups to encourage people to reduce waste. And they conduct Green Sweeps, in which employees pick up trash around their neighborhoods. Every big company risks losing the small business culture from which it began, but, as Starbucks has demonstrated, it’s possible to continue to strengthen the brand, authenticity, and employee- and customer-loyalty. Key message in this book: If you want success to mirror that of Starbucks, give your customers something authentic, whose values they can trust! If you want your business to grow like Starbucks, find ways to renew your brand and create a community that cares for its employees.  Actionable advice: Be stubborn! The next time you are having trouble with a task like raising money for your project, keep in mind that Schultz was turned down 217 of the 242 times he initially elicited investments for his coffee shop business. If you really want something, persistence is the key to achieving it.

Instead, we keep our head down, work hard and hope that we’ll eventually move up the greasy pole. These blinks show how this way of thinking is completely wrong. They show that if you want to get power you have to work for it. They provide tips on how you can stand out among the competition and make your way to the top. In these blinks, you’ll discover why if you are a nail, standing up is best; how one Democrat tamed the Republicans; and the true value of a smile. Every day you work hard at your job: you come in early, find a way to accomplish all your tasks and responsibilities and you stay late into the night, burning the midnight oil. With all that you do, you’re convinced that a promotion is right around the corner, just as soon as the boss notices all your hard work. But actually, you could be waiting a long time, because a broad range of studies have shown that there’s not much of a link between job performance and promotions. For example, a study on Fokker — a Dutch aircraft manufacturer — found that white-collar workers were only 12 percent more likely to be promoted when they received a performance rating of “very good,” as opposed to merely “good.” And this leads us to a common misunderstanding: many people mistakenly assume that positions of power and prestige are earned by people who deserve them. In other words, most of us think that the world is a fair place, a mindset that was first described by psychologist Melvin Lerner as the just-world hypothesis. We think that successful people are the ones who follow the rules. This viewpoint prevents us from adopting techniques used by people who have achieved their power through nefarious means. When we see someone who got to the top by using a slightly underhanded or ruthless approach — maybe by taking a little too much credit for a team project or by being rude with coworkers — we tell ourselves, “He’ll get what’s coming to him!” Since we take it for granted that their bad behavior will somehow be punished, we don’t bother to learn from their success. But that mindset is way too limiting, because we’re missing out on a wide range of useful tips and techniques just because we don’t like the people who use them. When you see the President, you probably think to yourself: “Now that’s a natural leader! It looks like she was born to do this job.” This reflects a common mindset: we often believe that some people are naturally suited to power, as if they have some genetic gift for it. But, in fact, anyone has the potential to become a great leader: you can learn leadership! So what does an education in leadership consist of? Well, it starts by understanding what kinds of qualities are inherent to good leadership. And the most visible quality associated with leadership is confidence. Think about it this way: You cannot hope to become a great leader if you don’t think you can be one. Rather, you need confidence to move toward your goal. Whatever you’re trying to achieve — whether it’s climbing Mount Everest or getting promoted at work — you cannot possibly hope to succeed if you don’t think you’re capable of it. But confidence isn’t the only thing that characterizes leadership; so does energy. Since the path to power is marked by early mornings and late nights of hard work, you need lots of energy to succeed. There’s another important quality inherent in strong leadership, too: empathy, the ability to understand what other people want. Throughout your entire career, you’ll have to stand out to get noticed by the decision-makers at the top. Thus, it helps to know what they’re looking for: do the decision-makers want a sensible and reliable person, or would they rather find someone with great communication skills and the capacity to lead? Confidence, energy and empathy are only a few of the qualities associated with leadership — there are many others, such as resiliency and self-awareness. And, ultimately, reflecting on these qualities and honestly considering which ones you embody (and which you don’t) is the first step to increasing your personal power. Because in order to be successful, you need to have a clear grasp of both your strengths and your weaknesses. Once you know your weaknesses, you can train yourself to overcome them. And in the upcoming blinks, you’ll find out how to do just that. When it comes to building a career, most of us intuitively understand that a multinational bank probably offers better future prospects than a local grocery store. And yet, the differences that exist between companies also exist within companies themselves, in different departments. And if you want to be on the path to power, it’s important to land in the right department. Want proof? One study analyzed the career paths of 338 managers in a public utility that employs 3,500 people. The researchers found that managers who began their career in the more high-powered departments enjoyed higher salary growth and were also more likely to land in powerful departments at other companies when they changed jobs. So how can you figure out which department is most powerful? There’s no universal answer that works across companies, so you have to evaluate on a case-by-case basis. There are three factors to consider. The first is pretty simple: it’s a matter of relative pay. More powerful departments tend to offer higher salaries. Physical proximity to top leadership is another important indicator of power. For example, the location of departments in the Pacific Gas and Electric Company’s headquarters changed to reflect a shift in power. Over time, the law and finance units moved up in the building, so that they were closer to senior management, while the engineering department moved down. And during this period, the representation of law and finance employees who moved into senior management positions rose accordingly. The third key way to gauge departmental power is to look at the composition of important committees, like the board of directors. More powerful departments will have higher representation in these committees. There’s an old Japanese proverb, “the nail that sticks out gets hammered down.” The author turns this proverb on its head. Put yourself in the shoes of a manager trying to decide who should get a promotion: If you’re looking at a wooden plank with dozens of nails hammered into it, and there’s one nail sticking out, which nail would you choose? Simply put: When it comes to career advancement, being more visible gets you noticed. But how can you achieve this? Start by asking powerful people for help. For example, you could invite your boss to a lunch meeting and then ask her what steps you should take in order to get a promotion. The boss will likely remember that you were confident and daring enough to ask her that question. Many people are afraid of making these kinds of moves because they feel that people will ignore or reject them. This principle was demonstrated in a study conducted by business school director Frank Flynn and doctoral student Vanessa Lake. Participants had two tasks: (1) To ask other people for a small favor (to fill out a questionnaire), and (2) To guess in advance how many requests they would have to make before someone agreed to do the favor. Unbelievably, participants overrated the number of people they thought they would have to ask by a factor of three. As the study suggests, you shouldn’t be afraid of asking for what you want and being visible. But what should you do when that’s not enough? You also have to be memorable; you have to stand out from the crowd for doing things differently. Just think of world-famous sports stars like Cristiano Ronaldo. Ronaldo is a great soccer player, but there are many great soccer players. Ronaldo doesn't break the rules of the game more often than others but he stands out because he breaks social rules by being overly narcissistic. Most of us can’t achieve power on our own; we need other people’s help to get to the top. But how can we get help? First, you need to provide something of value in exchange. In other words, you need to have resources: social support, money, career advice — any kind of asset people want or need. Sharing the resources you have will compel others to help you, because the exchange involves an element of reciprocity; after all, there’s a social obligation to return favors. For example, imagine you’re telling a colleague that you’re planning to move next weekend. And let’s say the colleague offers her help: if you choose to accept her assistance, you’ll probably have the feeling that you owe her something in return. And even if you don’t accept her offer at all, you still might feel obligated to offer her help next time she seems to need it. And, in fact, your ability to help others is a fantastic resource. In the workplace, there are plenty of boring menial tasks people seek to avoid. Helping a colleague with something like this won’t cost you very much, and will earn you a lot of gratitude. Let’s say your boss decides that your division should spend the day outside the office doing team-building activities. If you volunteer to help organize the day, your boss will be extremely grateful. Here’s another resource you can leverage: treat people fairly and politely. Don’t believe us? Consider Democrat Willie Brown, who was essentially ruled the California Assembly for 16 years. Although he promoted legislation that supported gay equality and the legalization of small amounts of marijuana, he received support from many ideologically-opposed Republican legislators. The reason for this unusual support? Brown had previously chaired a committee in which he treated Republicans with respect and fairness. He won respect, and thus his colleagues were willing to support him on certain matters, even when they personally disagreed. When you turn on any political talk show, you’ll see politicians quarreling with each other about whatever issue happens to be most controversial at the moment. Try to think of a moment when politicians from different sides of the aisle were able to agree about something. Can’t think of anything? Well, there is one thing: politicians agree that the way they speak and behave can communicate authority and influence people. This is an important principle all powerful people have internalized: the way you carry yourself influences the way people interact with you. And how you present yourself goes deep: your emotions don’t simply influence the people around you; they’re contagious. When you walk through a corridor smiling, for example, you’ll be greeted with smiles in return. A study on this very topic and its use in marketing found that people actually become happier themselves when they encounter others smiling. So, in this case, if they see an ad for a product containing someone smiling, the happiness will rub off on the customer — and she will have more positive feelings about the product. In short, if you want to become powerful, it helps to exude power. There are several ways you can do this convincingly. First of all, you should always display dominant behavior when interacting with others — for example, by displaying anger when you disagree with something. This was shown to be a successful strategy by psychologist Larissa Tiedens, who found that people who easily express anger are perceived to be strong, competent and smart. Another way to exude power is to take your time when speaking. This will prevent you from wasting words or contradicting yourself — which will make you seem competent. For example, the most successful politicians speak slowly and deliberately. They think about what they are going to say and make sure it’s clear and consistent. At the 2001 California Medical Association, Albin Avgher, PhD, presented a theory of human communication. Throughout his talk, Avgher expounded on some ideas and theories that went against the accepted practices of other physicians and attorneys in the audience. Nevertheless, most people stayed in their seats and listened attentively: They were truly interested in what this expert had to say. That is, they were interested until Avgher admitted that he wasn’t actually Albin Avgher, PhD, but rather a comedian named Charlie Varon — and that everything he had just said was completely made up. This anecdote highlights how much reputation matters if you want to get ahead. Because once people form a judgment about you, they’ll consistently find ways to back it up. In other words, they’ll concentrate on the things about you which are consistent with their judgement and ignore everything that isn’t. This process is called cognitive discounting. So since Varon had been introduced as a PhD, the audience members immediately assumed that he was an expert with a valuable opinion. This judgment led them to trust everything he said, even when it went against their prior knowledge. But it doesn’t end there: people modify their own behavior when they interact with you based on their assumptions. So if Varon had never gone on to disclose his real profession, the audience would have questioned him — though not by challenging his theories, but rather by asking less critically for supporting evidence about what they could learn from his research. As we’ve seen, reputation is crucial. How can you ensure that you have a good one? Well, nothing beats a first impression. If you fail at first, you might get stuck in an environment where people have a bad opinion of you. It might be easier to change companies than try to change anyone’s already established beliefs. Although most people are conflict-averse — that is, we try and avoid confrontation — the best leaders use a different tactic. These people realize that they’re bound to meet others with different goals and different values. And since they want to succeed, leaders figure out how to face these people head on and win them over. But of course, this approach isn’t about going out and picking a fight with just anyone. There are a few important ground rules to keep in mind. First of all, in order to become powerful, choose your fights wisely and don’t engage in unnecessary conflicts. There’s no reason to get worked up when someone parks in your favorite spot or forgets to put the milk back in the fridge. Instead, feel free to fiercely defend yourself when someone stands in the way of your main goals — by harshly criticizing your work, for example. And then when you do get involved in a conflict, always offer your opponents a graceful way to retreat. After all, you don’t want to make permanent enemies — people who feel compelled to attack you again and again — so act respectfully, even when you disagree with someone. This approach was the key to California Democrat Willie Brown’s political power. After winning a tough campaign fight, he helped his former rivals secure other kinds of desirable posts. Doing so kept them out of his way. Another important aspect of dealing with conflict has to do with how to move forward when you lose a battle. It’s natural to feel the desire to retreat when you experience an embarrassing failure, but don’t give in to the temptation. For inspiration, consider the story of Steve Jobs. When Jobs was fired from Apple, the company he co-founded in 1985, he considered leaving Silicon Valley. But instead he decided to start over. He started two companies, NeXT and Pixar, which went on to great success. He later called the whole experience, “the best thing that could have happened to me.” The key message: Although many of us mistakenly believe that power and success is earned by people who follow the rules, that’s not the most effective way to get what you want. Instead, you should develop your leadership skills, find ways to stand out from your competitors and exude confidence.   Actionable advice: If you want to establish a good reputation for yourself, ask for help! Too often, our attempts to promote ourselves are perceived as arrogance by other people. But if you can get someone else to promote you (by hiring a PR firm, for example), you can avoid this potential drawback.

Taylor","summary":"As the legendary Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu told his readers over 2,500 years ago, the key to victory is engaging your opponent on your own terms. If you can’t prevent conflict, choose the battlefield. Skirmishes in the marketplace aren’t won with cannons and swords, but they’re battles all the same. If you want to come out on top, you’ll need to define the terms of engagement. That’s something the world’s most successful companies do every day. Whether you’re a dog food manufacturer, a Swiss watchmaker or a Las Vegas hotel, the only way to stay one step ahead of the competition is by thinking outside the box. But you don’t have to reinvent the wheel to do that – you can learn from the best. Packed with actionable insights from figures as diverse as Henry Ford and the leaders of Netflix, these blinks are guaranteed to help you up your leadership skills and take your business to the next level.   In these blinks, you’ll learn how traditional industries use their illustrious histories to fend off newcomers; what Henry Ford learned when he visited a modern slaughterhouse; and why the best leaders combine humility and ambition. The world moves fast these days. Even well-established companies can wake up to find that they’ve been outrun by their competitors. Therefore, your best bet is often to get out of the rat race and focus your energies elsewhere. The most effective thing you can do is try to set yourself apart from the crowd. Take the advertising agency TBWA: in 2004, the dog food company Pedigree commissioned them to develop a new marketing strategy. Pedigree was in a sticky situation – it was being squeezed by high-end, health-focused brands on one side and low-price competition on the other. TBWA decided to redefine the rules of the game. Its advice to Pedigree? Stop marketing yourself as a dog food company and position yourself as a brand that simply cares about dogs. Employees were encouraged to bring their four-legged friends to work and even given health insurance plans for their pooches. Meanwhile, Pedigree started running ads for dog adoption. The product itself didn’t change at all, but the company’s image was transformed into a brand that stood for something more than just dog food. The fresh way of looking at things also gave Pedigree a new sense of purpose. Those in the know call this the rule of vuja dé – the opposite of déjà vu. It’s the sense of having already experienced something and finding a new way of looking at something familiar. Established companies have another resource up their sleeve when the going gets tough: their past successes. Nicolas Hayek, the CEO of the Swiss Corporation for Microelectronics and Watchmaking in the 1970s, showed how effective that could be. The Swiss watch industry was in crisis when he took up his position. Cheap East Asian watches had flooded the market. But instead of joining the race to the bottom, Hayek used the industry’s illustrious past to renew its identity. Storied watch brands owned by the company, like Omega, were rebranded as “watches for people who achieve” – a canny way of targeting high-earners willing to pay top dollar for a product rooted in tradition. The corporation’s cheaper watches were also given a makeover. In 1983, it launched Swatch – a brand specializing in less expensive timepieces made in Switzerland, rather than in countries with cheaper labor. Harnessing Switzerland’s association with its long history of watchmaking was a smart strategy – by 2008, Hayek’s corporation was the undisputed leader in its field. In 1912, Henry Ford visited a slaughterhouse in Chicago. What he saw there changed the face of carmaking forever. The slaughterhouse had a unique division of labor: carcasses were attached to a monorail and moved along a line of workers, each of whom had their own particular task to complete. That was the system Ford later employed in his factory. The iconic Ford Model T rolled off an assembly line inspired by what he’d seen at the slaughterhouse. It’s an excellent example of how groundbreaking innovations are often born from borrowing ideas well-established in other industries. Take Commerce Bank: in 1997 it was valued at $400 million. Ten years later it was bought out for a whopping $8.5 billion. So what changed in the intervening decade? The bank decided to look for new ideas outside its own sector. The supermarket chain Walmart was one source of inspiration. Their shops were open for between 70 and 80 hours a week, including Saturdays and Sundays. If Walmart can do it, Commerce Bank’s strategists asked, then why can’t we? Their decision to mimic the retail outlet revolutionized banking – an industry in which such hours were unheard of. But no matter how successful this approach can be, it’s still often controversial. Prepare yourself for resistance if you’re thinking of going down the same road! Just ask Gary Kaplan, CEO of Virginia Mason Medical Hospital in the early 2000s. The hospital was facing serious efficiency issues when Kaplan arrived. His solution was to send a group of employees to visit a Toyota factory in Japan and introduce them to new management techniques. “Just-in-time” manufacturing – what the Japanese call kanban – was starting to make waves. It’s a way of reducing the amount of time materials spend in inventory by optimizing scheduling. Sounds like a pretty useful idea for a hospital struggling with inefficiency, right? But that’s not what the doctors at Kaplan’s hospital thought. They objected to the notion that medical practitioners had anything to learn from a car manufacturer and put up stiff resistance. Many of them even boycotted the trip! Those who did go, however, soon saw why they’d been sent to Japan. The ideas they brought back helped them cut waiting times for lab results by a stunning 90 percent. That amounted to a three-fold increase in the time nurses could spend with their patients. When the author attended a conference for business leaders in regional banking, he was stunned by the results of a small survey of participants. The attendees had been asked a simple question: “Why should customers choose your bank over the competition?” Two-thirds of them couldn’t answer it! That’s a sign that something’s amiss. Your aim as a manager should be to run your company in such a way that everyone knows the answer to that question. Take the online retailer Zappos: it gave Amazon a run for its money until being acquired by them for a cool $1.2 billion in 2009. But how on earth did it manage to compete with them at all? It set itself apart from the crowd by excelling in one area – offering the best customer experience. Repeat customers, for example, invariably received free next-day delivery. The company’s call centers were well-staffed, and employees were free to spend as long as necessary talking to customers. If a customer enquired about a product that wasn’t in stock, Zappos’ agents searched out the best deal offered by their competitors. It didn’t make the company any money, of course, but the quality of customer care left a lasting impression on callers. Going the extra mile is an integral part of success in business. Companies like Zappos show that you can’t do big things when you limit yourself to current standards of excellence. Another company that’s put that insight to use is MGM Grand Las Vegas. When Gamal Aziz took charge of the hotel in 2001, it had profits of around $170 million. A few years later and they’d more than doubled to $400 million. What changed? Aziz looked at things differently. He wasn’t interested in increasing efficiency by a certain percentage, but in figuring out how much revenue the hotel space was capable of generating. Once he had a number, he worked backward from there. The MGM Grand’s restaurant was making a profit of $2 million a year. Aziz’s calculations showed that it could be making $5 million – meaning it was losing $3 million a year in potential profits. It was soon closed down, and a rebranded restaurant opened up in its place. It went on to make $6.5 million – surpassing even Aziz’s predictions! Businesses don’t need to be heartless Scrooge-like enterprises, squeezing every last penny out of their customers. In fact, there are plenty of companies whose human touch has given them a leg up in the modern world of commerce. That’s because successful businesses aren’t just money-making machines – they’re communities. Take DaVita Inc: the company operates just under fifteen-hundred kidney dialysis centers around the US. In 1999, it embraced a new image, summed up by the phrase “community before company.” So what does that look like in practice? DaVita employees are encouraged to create a welcoming and friendly environment for patients – the aim being to make them feel like they’re at home. When the author visited one of the company’s centers, he found the place humming with positive energy. The hallway featured a massive “wall of fame” covered in photos of employees and patients, as well as personal stories and messages. DaVita also runs training programs which assign executives to particular centers. There they learn from caregivers why the business matters and even perform caregiving work themselves. The idea is to make sure managers don’t lose touch with the nitty-gritty of day-to-day life in the company’s centers. It’s a winning approach. Between 1999 and 2009, DaVita turned its business around. From $50 million in annual losses, it started generating $400 million in profits! That makes sense when you know how important emotional engagement is to your customers. Show that you care and you’ll create a loyal customer base. Recent research by Gallup into customer satisfaction found that, according to the consulting group’s data, there’s little difference in customer behavior between those described as “rationally satisfied” and “rationally dissatisfied” when it comes to a company’s pricing and product quality. The real difference is between the rationally satisfied and the “emotionally engaged” – customers who identify themselves with the company and view its services as “irreplaceable.” London Drugs offers an instructive example of this human touch in action. The firm started out as a small Canadian pharmacy in 1945. Since then it’s branched out into a number of different markets, including real estate. Wherever it goes, success follows. An important part of the company’s initial success was its insistence on truly serving its existing customers. Instead of just asking how to get more customers, the company asked what more it could do for the ones they already had. This way, they became an important part of people’s lives. As a result of this, customers simply trust it with any product, whether it’s drugstore items or condos. CEOs are often depicted as lonely geniuses with near superhuman powers. That might make for entertaining movies and TV, but in the real world, this can be downright dangerous – both to managers and their companies. True leaders avoid drinking the kool-aid and take a different approach entirely – they strive to be humbitious. The concept of “humbition” – a blend of humility and ambition – was coined by Jane Harper. It’s a leadership style she advocated during her long stint at the American technology giant IBM. What does it look like in practice? The idea is simple: leaders should be ambitious while recognizing the fact that other people in the company might know something they don’t. Because success is a fruit of collaboration, leaders should give credit where credit is due. After all, no leader – however brilliant – can compete with the combined brainpower of the company’s employees. Dave Marsing is another leader who believes in the humbitious approach. A high-flyer at the tech company Intel Corp, he suffered a heart attack at the age of 36. Since then, he’s been a fierce advocate of rethinking traditional ideas of leadership. Embracing humility, he argues, is key when it comes to achieving results without working so hard that your heart might not be able to keep up. But it’s not just leaders who benefit from taking their foot off the gas pedal – the whole company does. That’s because the best ideas often come from the bottom of an organization. CEOs who understand that have the best chance of succeeding. One example comes from the software company Rite-Solutions: It introduced something called “Mutual Fun” – an internal “stock market” of ideas proposed by employees. Everyone at the company is free to make proposals and vote on those of others by buying “stocks” in the ones they like. The schemes and plans which do best in this marketplace of ideas are adopted by the company, which rolls them out as products, services and innovations. Between 2005 and 2009, this radical initiative generated more than 50 workable ideas, with a total of 15 being put into place. Together, those ideas accounted for around 20 percent of Rite-Solutions’ total revenue! Imagine you had the combined brainpower of the whole world at your disposal. You’d be mad not to make use of it, right? Well, in a way you already do! The information age has created innumerable opportunities for companies to draw on the global hive mind to give themselves a boost. That’s pretty handy since the best solution to a problem usually presents itself after you’ve sought all the help that’s available. Take American media service provider Netflix: in 2006, the company announced a competition to improve Cinematch, its in-house film and TV show recommendation software. The goal was to make it at least ten percent more likely that customers would give movies suggested by Cinematch a high rating. It was an ambitious target – so much so that Netflix’s own employees had little chance of hitting it on their own. So they outsourced the challenge, announcing that the best solution would receive a million-dollar cash prize. The competition created a truly global community. People pooled their resources and shared their ideas and coding skills on online forums, unleashing a wave of international brainpower. The winner? A seven-person team that collaborated online without ever meeting one another in person! Asking strangers for help is one thing, but there’s a more specific group of people who are also likely to have illuminating ideas – your customers. That’s something the t-shirt company Threadless puts into practice every day – all its products are designed by its customers. Here’s how it works: People share their designs on the company’s website and vote on the designs of other users. If their design wins enough people over to be rolled out, they receive a $2000 prize and a $500 voucher to use in the online shop. It’s a winning formula. Threadless only needs a team of 35 employees and sells around a million t-shirts every year. But it’s more than just a business – it’s also a community of customer-designers, some of whom have used the site as a springboard to launch their own careers. The key message in these blinks: If you want to give your business a boost, it’s a good idea to take a look at what today’s most successful companies are doing. Whether it’s IBM or Pedigree, you’ll usually find that their strategies have a couple of things in common – including setting themselves apart from the crowd, being open to new ideas from other industries and building a community as well as a business. Put those into practice, and you’re bound to see your business thrive.  Actionable advice: Ask yourself what makes your business special. If you want your company to stand out from the crowd, you need to know what makes it unique. Asking yourself a few simple questions will help to figure that out. What are you trying to achieve? What do you do that your competitors don’t? The answers will not only give you a clearer sense of purpose, but they’ll also show you what changes you might need to make. Got feedback?

That man is driving a Maserati: he must have found success. That woman is wearing Louboutins: she must have found success. But this take is entirely superficial. As you’ll learn in these blinks, actual success can’t be seen or measured in material trappings. It’s an inner quality, something that anyone can build – no fancy cars or red-soled shoes necessary. So how can you build up these vital internal qualities? You must listen to the advice of self-development behemoth, Steven Covey, and concentrate on working on the 12 levers of success. These blinks explain what these levers are and how you can utilize them yourself. Follow this advice and it won’t be long before you’re enjoying a fulfilling and peace-filled life that’s driven by primary greatness. In these blinks, you’ll also find out why importance trumps urgency; how to find your purpose; and why you should imagine the worst. What does success look like? Is it Armani suits, Rolex watches, cherry-red Ferraris and a daily glass of champagne on the deck of a Long Island beach house? Sure, these might be some of the symbols of wealth – but they’re certainly not signs of success. True success can’t be seen. It comes from within and is generated by what the author calls primary greatness, which naturally comes to those who embody admirable qualities such as integrity, honor, persistence, selflessness and a commitment to a purpose that transcends the personal. Secondary greatness, in contrast, can be seen. It’s the appearance of success – the money and the fame and all the attendant status symbols, from cars to suits to houses. However, whereas primary greatness leads to fulfillment and inner peace, secondary greatness dead-ends at fleeting pleasures and financial security. Now, if you haven’t spent your life fostering stalwart inner attributes like honor and selflessness, don’t fret. It’s been scientifically proven that such traits can be developed. In Michigan, back in 1965, the Perry Preschool Project began following the lives of 123 inner-city preschoolers. They were divided into two groups – test and control – and the test group learned, at an early age, to delay gratification by engaging in boring and low-reward tasks. Fast-forward 50 years, and those in the test group were much more successful. Compared with those in the control group, more of the test-group members had graduated and found employment, and fewer had been arrested. All this because, in preschool, they’d built some primary greatness by developing attributes like integrity and persistence. So what can you do to develop your character? Well, as you’ll soon learn, there are 12 levers of success, a set of principles that will serve as the foundation for your primary greatness. These levers are integrity, contribution, priority, personal sacrifice, service, reciprocity, diversity, responsibility, loyalty, learning, teaching and renewal. These 12 levers are the result of the author’s extensive research. He’s taught and learned from thousands of people worldwide, and distilled his findings into the essentials for primary greatness. Inner peace, a sense of fulfillment, long-lasting prosperity – the benefits of primary greatness are myriad and magnificent. But how exactly do you move toward acquiring it? Well, there are a few handy techniques that will prep your brain and make it more receptive. The first is to use self-affirmations. Self-affirmations are positive messages delivered in the first person and the present tense from yourself, to yourself. They affirm the life you want to live and nudge you toward making your aspirations into a reality. Let’s say you’re a procrastinator, and you want to get better at taking the reins and getting things done. Your self-affirmation might be something like, “It’s gratifying to take control and guide my own life by proactively planning my time and following through on my plans.” Once you’ve cooked up some suitable self-affirmations, you can improve their efficacy by doing two things: First, relax. When you’re relaxed, your brain waves slow down, making you more receptive to sensory input – and you want to be as receptive as possible when reciting your affirmations. Second, recite your affirmations every day. The more you say them, the more likely they are to manifest. The next technique is about your general outlook on life, and it requires you to shift your mind-set entirely. Instead of obsessing about scarcity, you’ve got to start focusing on abundance. Most of us have a scarcity mind-set – that is, we view the world through a win-lose lens, believing that more for others means less for us, and neglecting opportunities for cooperation and shared benefit.   But this is often detrimental to success. Just think of a ball hog on a basketball team. By taking too many shots and refusing to pass, such a player not only robs his teammates of the chance to score, he also lowers morale, flouts the code of fair play and, more often than not, costs his team the game. Now, if that player shifted to an abundance mind-set – where the world is viewed through a win-win lens, and there’s always enough to go around – he might take a huddle with his teammates and realize that, by passing the ball and allowing his fellow players to pose a threat, they can weaken the defense and win the game. Integrity. It’s a word that gets thrown around a lot, but, if asked, would you be able to define it succinctly? Well, since it’s the first of the 12 levers of success and the foundation of primary greatness, it’s important to have a clear definition. So the author broke it down into its component parts, and he found that integrity is a combination of two traits: humility and courage. If you are humble enough to recognize where you can improve and courageous enough to undertake the work of improvement, you’ll be well on your way to becoming a person of integrity. To get a sense of what integrity looks like in action, let’s take a look at a situation from the author’s life. Once, a close friend of the author’s hurt him deeply – but this friend realized what he’d done and gave a heartfelt apology. The author, impressed, asked him how he’d managed it, and the friend said that, after an in-depth conversation with himself, he’d realized he had two options: listen to his ego and give a lukewarm apology or listen to his conscience and give a meaningful one.   It took humility to recognize that he should be penitent and courage to act on this recognition – and it was this combination that resulted in the friend’s displaying true integrity. This act of integrity had a very powerful effect, inspiring the author not only to accept the apology, but to forgive the initial trespass. So, having integrity will positively affect those around you; but it will also shape you in beneficial ways – namely, by aligning your values, beliefs and actions. This alignment is called congruence. If you’ve got congruence, you’ll find it much easier to gain the trust of others. This is, in part, because you’ll simply seem more authentic. By aligning your actions with your beliefs and values, you’ll shed all hidden motives and secret agendas, and walking your talk will simply become second nature. People need purpose. Whether it’s writing novels or raising a family, a purpose imbues life with meaning, giving its possessor a sense of direction and duty. And yet only between five and ten percent of people take the time to define their purpose. Purpose is crucial because, without it, you won’t know how to contribute to the world, and contribution is the second lever of success. To identify your purpose, start by asking yourself three questions: What is the world lacking? What do I excel at? And how could I contribute by doing something I like? Keep in mind that your purpose might be right in front of your nose. Often, we aim too high and fail to notice how we can contribute right here, right now. For example, consider the protagonist of the film Mr. Holland’s Opus. He dreams of becoming a brilliant composer, but he’s forced to work as a music teacher, a job he initially dislikes. But the years go by and he begins to love his students. In the end, he doesn’t become a famous composer. Instead, he pours his passion into teaching and contributes by helping thousands of students. So remain open to the possibility that, without realizing it, you may have already found your purpose – all you have to do is identify it. Once you’ve figured out how to contribute to the world, you can focus on the third lever of success: prioritization. Prioritizing is largely a matter of differentiating between important but non-urgent tasks and urgent but non-important tasks. Important, non-urgent tasks take the bigger picture into account, and they should always be prioritized. Imagine you’re a doctor and, while performing heart surgery, a nurse runs in and says there’s an urgent call for you. Well, it doesn’t matter how urgent the call is, because, in the big picture, the patient’s survival is of the utmost importance. Importance always trumps urgency, so you wouldn’t take the call. This example also demonstrates how a higher purpose – in this case, the purpose of saving the patient’s life – naturally leads to prioritization of what’s most important. Maybe you left some dishes in the sink, assuming your partner would wash them. Maybe you “accidentally” cut someone off in traffic. Or maybe you just didn’t take the time to call your mother. Yes, being selfish is normal. However, if you want to form meaningful and productive relationships, you’ve got to fight those selfish tendencies and nourish the fourth lever of success – sacrifice. Sacrifice means putting aside your ego and focusing on the greater good. It’s about emphasizing the outcome of collaborative work, as opposed to claiming credit for contributing the most, and, like integrity, it requires humility. For example, a company’s president and vice president once took a business trip together. On the second day of the trip, the vice president awoke to a surprising sight: the president was shining his shoes. He was startled to find the president engaged in this humble activity; it seemed the opposite of presidential. However, it also helped the vice president see the president’s human side, and, in the end, it brought the two men closer together. Sacrificing your ego isn’t terribly difficult – and it can go a long way toward creating a lasting bond. In that regard, it’s similar to service, which is the fifth lever of success. Service is about doing things for other people, and it’s the perfect way to strengthen the relationships that sacrifice helped you create. One way to serve is to speak as though you’re only addressing one person, regardless of how large your audience is. This will show others that you’re engaged with them, that you’re doing them the service of being present, and, in turn, it will help them engage with you, as the following anecdote demonstrates: The star of a play was once having trouble capturing the attention of his audience. Luckily, a friend of his had the presence of mind to abandon his seat, approach the stage and mouth the words “talk to me.” The actor understood and began addressing the audience as though it were a pal, a person with real feelings and thoughts. Just like that, the audience recognized this service and reengaged. Now that you’ve got an idea how to establish and strengthen relationships, let’s take a look at how to make them productive. Interestingly enough, one of the best ways to build a beneficial relationship with others is to improve how secure you feel about yourself. A self-assured character is, in fact, the foundation of the next two levers of success – reciprocity and diversity. Self-assurance – that is, a deep feeling of inner security – enables you to remain open to unfamiliar ideas and new opinions. And this openness will imbue you with empathy, something without which reciprocal relationships can’t exist.   If you’re insecure, you’ll be closed off. Different ideas and new perspectives will feel threatening, because to those who lack self-assurance, a threat to a belief system feels like a threat to personal identity. Only after establishing some solid self-assurance should you start focusing on reciprocity, the sixth lever of success. But, when you do activate this lever, there are two things to focus on: First, concentrate on bonding. The firmer the social bond between two people, the less likely they’ll be to act selfishly. Second, keep communication channels open. Sharing and collaborating on problems, and discussing possible solutions, will increase the reciprocity of any relationship. Self-assurance is also the foundation of the seventh lever of success, diversity, which is all about encouraging a range of opinions, skills, personalities and ideas. These things drive innovation and positivity – but they’ll be under threat if you and your team aren’t self-assured. Remember, insecure people think difference is threatening, so, in order to oust limited thinking, you’ve got to encourage people to embrace difference and openly express themselves. In other words, you’ve got to help them feel self-assured. The author points out that, when there’s no diversity of opinion within a team, there’s essentially only one opinion – and that’s bad for creativity and innovation. New and diverse ideas will breed new and diverse projects and products; if you welcome difference, you’re bound to make one. We’ve all experienced it. There you are, at the bar with friends or eating lunch with colleagues, and somebody starts bad-mouthing an absent pal or coworker. Such behavior is common, but it’s also horribly toxic. The eighth lever, loyalty, combats such toxicity by holding you back from ever disrespecting other people, regardless of whether they’re present or absent. Loyalty and respect are important because they remove the negative interactions that often lead to negative labeling, which has a very tangible and toxic effect. Let’s say a colleague of yours insults you and, in consequence, you label her in your mind as “hateful.” Even if you never let on that you find her hateful, she will, on some level of consciousness, pick up on how you actually feel, and her actions will begin to align with your expectations. Just as you should avoid labeling people, you should never say anything about anyone that you wouldn’t want to say to their face. Further, if you’re ever present when people are talking negatively about someone else, you should combat the negative labeling by mentioning a few positive things about the absent person. Speaking up for the voiceless is loyalty at its finest. Of course, we can’t always be perfect. Whether it’s gossiping or some other slip up, people make mistakes. And that’s where the ninth lever, responsibility, comes in. Truly taking responsibility entails fully acknowledging your mistakes and offering an apology that isn’t hedged around with excuses, defensiveness or explanations. If you really want to move past a mistake, you’ve got to take the full blame; that’s the only way to remove negative labels and receive forgiveness And remember: once you’re forgiven, be sure that your actions chime with the apology you made. This will show that you were sincere, and that your apology wasn’t merely an empty expedient. Imagine that, for the next ten years, you learn nothing new. Well, the truth is that, if you stopped learning, you’d become irrelevant: your skills and knowledge would get you nowhere in the world of ten years hence. So how can you keep growing and stay up-to-date? The best way is to keep learning, which is the tenth lever of success. Horst Schulze, the cofounder of the Ritz-Carlton hotel chain, knows this well. Despite the cost, Schulze provides a daily training program for employees, because he firmly believes in the importance of learning. By helping his employees grow, Schulze also grows his company – because a skilled workforce is the backbone of his chain. On a more personal level, there are many things you can do to keep learning. You could, for instance, design a personal curriculum. If you’re interested in business, read Harvard Business Review or Fortune magazine. There are academic journals for every field, so just identify your interests and dive in. And, to broaden your horizons and make you wiser, don’t neglect the classics. A little Shakespeare before bed can only do good.  You could also attend your very own online university. Watch TED talks; enroll in one of the many massive open online courses (MOOCs); make use of Khan Academy. And if you really want to learn something, be sure to use the eleventh lever of success – teaching. As the author learned from Dr. Walter Gong, a San Jose State University professor, teaching is the best way to learn. During dinner, Dr. Gong always had his children teach him what they’d learned that day in school – and all three of them went on to earn PhDs from a top university. Teaching works so well because, when you know you’ll have to make someone else understand the material, you’re forced to really learn it. That’s why every student should learn like a teacher! So we’ve been focusing a lot on the component parts of primary greatness. But if you really want to a serve a higher purpose, and live a fulfilled and peaceful life, you’ve got to take care of yourself. And that’s where the twelfth lever, renewal, comes in. Self-care is a matter of balancing your mental, physical and social health. One way to inspire physical- care habits is to imagine you’ve already had a major health setback – that, say, you’ve had a heart attack or undergone surgery for cancer. Just imagining such a health crisis should motivate you to break any unhealthy habits you might have, be it overwork or smoking cigarettes. To improve your mental health, imagine that, in three years’ time, all your professional knowledge will have been made obsolete by technological advances. This should spur you to prioritize learning and the advancement of your skills. To keep yourself socially healthy, imagine that everyone in your life is always listening to the things you say about them. This should keep you from saying regrettable things and being judgmental. This doesn’t mean you should be uncritical – just that you should be kind in your criticism, and not say things about someone that you wouldn’t say to them. If you regularly engage with these hypothetical situations, you’ll be able to adjust your mind-set. It’s much more effective to put energy toward your physical, mental and social health than to try to pinpoint and alter every single negative behavior, since a more general approach influences multiple behaviors at the same time. Physical, mental and social health are also closely connected, and focusing on all of them is the best, most holistic, form of self-care. For instance, if you neglect your skills and knowledge, you may get fired from your job, which might lead to your feeling like a victim and blaming others. This would affect your social relationships, leading to stress, which would compromise your physical health.        A holistic approach to self-care is the best defense against burnout and the negative chain reaction that neglect of one area can cause. The key message in this book: A life centered on making connections with and in the service of others is far more rewarding than a life spent hunting for self-serving pleasures such as status and money. And the best way to find real fulfillment and inner peace is to establish your primary greatness. You can do this with the help of the 12 levers of success: integrity, contribution, priority, personal sacrifice, service, reciprocity, diversity, responsibility, loyalty, learning, teaching and renewal. Actionable advice: Keep a “journey to primary greatness” journal. Keep a journal to track your progress toward primary greatness and use it to collect your learnings along the way. Jot down your higher purpose and all of your self-affirmations. Use it to record all the situations where you have chosen secondary over primary greatness. This will help grow your self-awareness as you travel toward s your ultimate goals. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Have you asked yourself how to push your team or wondered whether performance reviews really lead to better work? Profit from the Positive provides a complete system that will help you become a better leader and improve your team’s performance. You’ll learn how to get more work done without working more hours, how to control your emotions and improve a bad mood, how to avoid making hiring mistakes, and more. The best part? You don’t have to be an expert, have a budget, or get your boss’ permission. Anyone can use these tools, whether you manage four or 40,000 people. In addition, you’ll learn how putting a pen in your mouth can make you happier; why a bad mood can be as infectious as a cold; and why asking someone to rate their own weirdness can save you lots of money. If you’re a manager, you’re probably always on the lookout for new ways to increase both your own and your employees’ productivity. Let’s take a look at a few simple tricks for achieving that. First of all, always take the time to formulate a plan before leaping into action. The importance of this can be seen in a study by psychologist Peter Gollwitz, where he told his students to write a report on how they spent Christmas, and hand it in on 27 December. While half the students just got the assignment, the other half were also asked to identify exactly when and where they would complete it. It turned out that this “plan” made a huge difference: 71 percent of the second group submitted their reports on time, compared to just 32 percent who’d made no concrete commitment to getting it done. This insight is easy to apply in other areas too. For example, saying, “Could you bring that report to the conference room after the 10 a.m. meeting?” is more effective than, “Could you hand it in tomorrow?” because the former creates a specific plan for the other person to follow. Another way to improve productivity is tricking yourself into getting started. Let’s say you’ve got a long, daunting to-do list and you’re having trouble getting started. Just pretend you’ve already begun! Jot down a few additional tasks that you’ve already completed, and then cross them out. This simple act will make you feel like you’ve already done something, which will motivate you to continue. Finally, if you really want to be more productive, create positive habits and routines. Consider Deborah. She used to check her email all the time, interrupting her other work. To improve her productivity, she decided to adopt a new positive habit: checking her emails only four times a day, at specific times, and not just whenever a new email arrived in her inbox. This allows her to better focus on her work, saving her time in the long run. To be a true leader, it isn’t enough to be productive – you also have to be resilient. Because the truth is, we all experience setbacks and disappointments. What matters most is how quickly we bounce back. So don’t quit just because something went wrong in the past. Rather, be grateful for these mistakes and learn from them. Use these experiences to help you confront current challenges. If your company loses a client, ask yourself: How did that happen? How can we avoid making the same mistakes with our new client? Once you’ve asked these questions about the past, move forward by putting your focus on the present and future. What do you hope to learn from this new project? What mistakes might you make? How can you avoid them? Finding the cause of the failure will help you learn from the experience. One excellent technique for analyzing what went wrong and preparing for new projects is called the Me-Always-Everything Framework. In this framework, you analyze failure from three different perspectives: \nMe: Ask, did I cause this failure? Or did external events cause it? Was it a combination of both? \nAlways: Does this situation always happen to me? Or is this a one-off setback? \nEverything: Will this event spill over into other domains in my life? Or is this an isolated situation? Another key to resilience is to change your perspective on a bad situation. If you’re feeling negative, shifting your perspective to a more positive mind-set may spur you to action. For example, consider the severity perspective: How bad is this compared to other situations you’ve already faced? Remembering bad situations you’ve mastered will allow you to draw strength from them. You might also consider the extremes perspective: What’s the worst thing that could happen? What’s the best? And then, finally, what is the most likely to happen? Thinking about these aspects will help you see things in a more positive light. After all, to err is human. Simply learn from your mistakes and move on! We don’t always realize it, but our moods have a powerful effect on everyone around us. That’s because emotions are catching, as explained by social contagion theory. Basically we humans are hardwired to mimic each other’s facial expressions and moods. According to the theory, just one person in any team of five can “infect” the other four. So when you’re in a bad mood at work, it spreads like a cold, which can seriously damage productivity. On the other hand, positive feelings are equally contagious. Studies show that when bank tellers are in a good mood, they produce greater customer satisfaction by passing on their upbeat emotions. This phenomenon also has a status component. People higher up in the organizational hierarchy are more contagious, meaning that an office leader’s positive or negative mood can spread to others in the team in as little as seven minutes, quickly impacting everyone’s performance. This was demonstrated in a study of 53 sales managers: When leaders were in a good mood, their teams performed better, generating higher sales. So although it’s extremely important for leaders to stay positive, we all get the blues from time to time – that’s natural. But it’s important to overcome your bad moods. Let’s look at four different techniques you can try. These techniques can help you infect your staff with only good moods! Now that you embody productive, resilient and contagious leadership, there’s another attribute you need to master. You need to become a strength-based leader – someone who focuses on strength, not weakness. So for instance, when analyzing your business, ask questions about what your company is doing right: Where is this change or process being implemented well? What can we learn here that could apply to other areas? What makes this employee or competitor successful? Why does this team or location constantly exceed expectations? This approach allows you to focus on solutions, not faults. It’s also a fantastic way to handle challenges your business may be facing. For example, when you’re facing an obstacle, say: “Let’s brainstorm solutions. What are some short-term possibilities? Long-term ones?” This will help everyone focus on solving the problem. Of course, managing a team is stressful. Some managers, in an effort to avoid having problems dumped on their desks, tell employees, “Don’t bring problems if you can’t propose a solution.” But this is flawed logic. If employees aren’t communicating with you about serious problems, you might learn about them too late. Another important aspect of strength-based leadership is that you and everyone on your team actually have to know their own strengths. Research bears this out: A sales team was asked to complete a 40-minute strength assessment followed by a one-on-one discussion of the results. Another sales team didn’t. The team that completed the assessment later generated 17 percent more sales than the other, showing that focusing on strength really lifts performance. So how can you uncover your own strengths? Just ask yourself three questions: What am I good at? What kind of work energizes me? When am I at my best? Ultimately, being a strength-based leader doesn’t mean ignoring problems, just focusing on solutions. Every organization needs new people every now and then. The trouble is, how do you find the right people? This question is a serious one because hiring mistakes are expensive: factoring in everything, each mistake costs a company around five times the hire’s salary! So how can you ensure you make the right hires? Perhaps the most important tool you have at your disposal is the interview, so you need to prepare it well. Don’t make the typical mistake of talking too much. Let them do the talking so you also get a feel for the candidate’s personal skills. They are often more important than technical ones. For example, if you’re looking for a customer service person, it’s better to hire someone with a positive attitude and no experience, than someone with a lot of experience but a bad attitude. After all, you can always teach someone new skills, but it’s much harder to change their attitude. In the same vein, it’s important to only hire people who fit your company’s culture. Google developed a term for inspiring employees: Googly. A Googly employee is a smart, creative, a good problem solver and fun. You, too, need to figure out what kind of employee profile would fit your own company. Of course, to be able to do this, you have to first understand your company’s culture, starting with your organization’s core values. Only then can you tailor your interview to find suitable people. Let’s look at Zappos, which celebrates individuality among its employees. When interviewing job applicants, the CEO always asks: “On a scale from one to ten, how weird on you?” This question helps identify employees who would enjoy the individualistic company culture. This leads to higher employee loyalty and less staff turnover. Finally, give the hiring process enough time: the typical one-hour interview may not cut it. For example, at Rackspace, prospective employees stay at the office for nine or ten hours. That way they truly get to know the company – and vice versa. Here’s something you may find surprising: Focusing on what people do well, rather than their weaknesses, will boost productivity. This means once you’ve assessed your own strengths, you should start focusing on what your employees do best. This was demonstrated in a study that tried to pinpoint aspects of effective leadership. One of the metrics was the intensity of leaders’ focus on their employees’ strengths, and researchers found that managers who scored in the top quartile for this metric achieved 50 percent better project performance than managers who paid less attention. Connecting with your employees about their strengths doesn’t have to be a big event. Make helping them tap into their skills part of your everyday interaction. These conversations don’t have to happen solely on a one-on-one basis, either. When personal strengths are part of daily conversations and team meetings, employees will get to know their colleagues’ core abilities. This will create an environment in which differences are understood and valued, because they’re seen as contributions to the overall power of the team. This helps avoid conflict. To start creating this kind of atmosphere, host a workshop where you go around the room and ask team members to share one or two of their strengths and discuss how they’ve used them recently. And once everybody knows each other’s strengths and weakness, you can collaboratively plan how to position the team for success on upcoming projects, leveraging the sum of those strengths. By identifying and cultivating your employees’ key skills, what you’re really doing is getting people to perform their best. Performance reviews can be an uncomfortable experience for managers and employees alike. But they don’t have to be. Instead of going into a performance review to evaluate your employee, see it as a time to re-energize them. Start by using the language of strength. For example, say something like: “Ann, you’re an exemplar of the achiever strength. You’re focused, hardworking and always deliver. I’d like you to keep using your learner strength to learn new processes.” Also, make sure you don’t set vague goals. When you tell employees, “Just do your best,” they’re more likely to slack off, since they don’t know how to improve. Instead, try something like: “You’re an emotional person. I like that side of you. Please write down your worries and feelings about this new project and send them to me by 2 p.m.” These kinds of specific goals will help you connect with your employees, but to really motivate people, it’s important to also set challenging goals. For proof, just ask Gary Latham, who researches goals at the University of Toronto. In multiple studies of different occupations, Latham found that those who set challenging and specific goals performed better than those who didn’t. That’s because when you accomplish a goal, you feel pride. “Challenging goals facilitate pride in accomplishment,” explains Latham. And to make the most of the goals you set, review them more than once a year. That way, you’re motivating your employees again and again. Finally, go beyond the conventional performance review and make it a preview. Ask your employees to preview their performance for the year ahead. Have them imagine you’re meeting a year from now to discuss their work. Ask them to visualize what a successful year would look like and what they have specifically done to achieve their goals. Then, make the conversation especially memorable by asking your employees to write down their preview. So while performance reviews may get a bad rep, they’re actually a great chance to push your team. Imagine a world in which your employees actually look forward to meetings. It might sound impossible, but you can make it happen. How? First of all, pay special attention to openers and closers. The way you start and end meetings matters because it’s unrealistic to assume that everyone has arrived in a good mood and ready to focus. Consider this: a staggering 91 percent of surveyed respondents admitted to daydreaming during meetings. You don’t have control over anyone’s mind-set, but kicking off with a positive opener will boost the overall mood. To do this, recognize an accomplishment, acknowledge a specific success or tell a funny story. Another way to improve moods at the start of a meeting is by offering a small gift. For example, in one study, two sets of doctors were asked to make a complex diagnosis for a patient. One group was asked to first read the medical profession’s ethical code. The other group received a piece of candy instead. The sweets helped: The second group of doctors were three times as accurate as the first. And once you’ve nailed the beginning, don’t neglect the ending, because people always remember the last few minutes of a meeting. Take time to discuss next steps and end things on a positive note. Another key to running a productive meeting is ensuring everyone has a chance to contribute. Of course, managing the conversation is challenging for any meeting facilitator. To get people to speak up or to stop talking, try this: Before the meeting, draw a circle on a sheet of paper. Label the circle with each participant’s name. As each person contributes, put a checkmark next to their name so you can follow who participates and who doesn’t. If you notice someone interrupting, step in. Acknowledge the point and move on by asking for another perspective. Tell your team you don’t need superstars – you want everyone to participate. Follow these steps and your employees might actually look forward to meetings. By now you’ve read about quite a few tools and ideas for effective leadership. But how can you actually apply them to the real world? First of all, start small. You don’t need anyone’s permission to use these tools; you don’t need your boss or the HR department to get on board. Just pick three techniques you can start doing today and go for it! For example, why not start today’s meeting with a piece of cake and a compliment? Another key to implementing these tools successfully: Use language everybody understands. Avoid jargon – it’ll make people lose interest in your suggestions or think you’re arrogant, and either way, they’ll just ignore you. Remember Gollwitz’s study, which described how specific plans help us achieve goals? Well, never refer to it by that name because no one’s going to know what that means. Instead, coach your employees in layman’s terms: tell them they can achieve their goals by identifying where and when they’ll complete certain tasks. Here’s something else you might remember: Social contagion theory, which explains how emotions circulate. You don’t need to use the term in order to benefit from the insight. Pay attention to the mood you project when you walk into work. If it’s not positive, change it. Finally, a crucial point for anyone who wants to apply what we’ve learned to the real world: Don’t resist resistance. When we try to introduce something new – whether at work or at home – our ideas are often met with resistance. That’s totally natural. If you can expect resistance then you won’t be surprised by it. Instead, you can view it as a promising sign of change. When people in our lives resist our ideas, it typically means that they have their own pain points that need to be addressed. So give them some time to rethink their attitude. That’s it! Now you’re prepared. So make a brief plan and trick yourself into getting started. Good luck! The key message in this book: Productive leaders create positive habits, like checking emails only at specified times, and always make plans before starting projects. They’re also good at controlling their emotions as well as focusing on solutions and strengths, rather than problems. And even when things go wrong, productive leaders are resilient and learn from their mistakes. Actionable advice: Feeling grumpy and irritable? Try the pen smile. Simply hold a pen gently between your teeth for a couple of minutes. Why will that work? Well, the pose is similar to the position our mouths are in when we’re smiling. Holding the pen activates our smiling muscles, inducing the brain to think “Oh, this is funny.” This simple physical act produces a feeling of happiness, which consequently mitigates our bad mood and makes us more productive. This easy trick can help ease your negative mood, putting you in a more positive mental state. Suggested further reading: How to Be a Positive Leader by Jane E.

Many of us see companies and their leaders as obsessed with money, interested in nothing but the pursuit of profits at all costs. Anything that gets in their way – be it employees, customers or the environment – is ruthlessly pushed aside. Yet, this isn’t necessarily the case. As these blinks show, no successful business can hope to reach the top if they are just in it for the money. The only way they can get there is by having a set of values, or purposes, that provide them with the will and drive to succeed.   Most of these values come from centuries of philosophical debate and tradition. To save you from having to trawl through the works of Nietzsche and Aristotle, these blinks provide you with the most prominent forms of purpose, and how businesses from Wal-Mart to IBM have used them to succeed. In these blinks, you’ll discover why Warren Buffett isn’t in it for the money; why Henry Ford succeeded by acting like a dictator; and why many of the best leaders’ main goal is the happiness of others. Why do some succeed in business, while others don’t? Sure, it has a lot to do with economic brilliance and charisma, but that’s not the whole story. A company’s purpose, the set of moral ideas that guide it, is crucial for lasting success. Purpose is the moral backbone that we rely on to make decisions, whether it’s in everyday life or when the stakes are much higher. With purpose, we can discern between choices that are right and worthwhile, and those that are easy or technically correct. Let’s put this into real terms. Do you want to serve your customer, or maximize your returns? This is a question Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton could answer without a second thought. Driven by altruism and compassion, Walton was dedicated to serving his customers. His sense of purpose reverberated throughout the whole company. From senior managers to store staffers, everyone at Wal-Mart was ready to make customer service a top priority. This gave Wal-Mart an edge over its competitors, which it outperforms time and time again. The reality is, without purpose, you’ll only make decisions with the short term in mind – strategy simply isn’t enough. Take Enron, a corporation whose collapse was one of America’s biggest corporate bankruptcies. They had strategies, but lacked purpose. All they were interested in was making money, and were prepared to do anything to do so. This led to poor decision making, which involved dangerous strategies and concealing losses. Unsurprisingly, Enron’s actions caught up with them in the end, a testament to how dangerous a strategy without purpose can be. You now know what purpose is, and why it’s important. So how can you acquire it? Well, purpose takes four forms, each of which stems from ethical traditions that have developed through the work of different philosophers from Classical Greece to the modern era. Let’s start with the purpose of discovery. This purpose is tied to the work of Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard and the existentialists, and their powerful arguments for the ethic of choice. Kierkegaard asserts that it’s simply not enough to hide behind rules and conventions, and blame them when things go badly. Instead, individuals are responsible for the choices they make. Kierkegaard uses the biblical tale of the sacrifice of Isaac to illustrate this principle. As you may well know, Abraham intends to sacrifice his son Isaac after hearing the voice of an angel encouraging him to do so. Abraham claims that it is God who tells him to do this, but ultimately, it’s Abraham’s choice – he is the only one who can be held responsible. In the same way, it is only we who can be held accountable for what we do. So what does this idea have to do with making new discoveries? Well, French existentialist Jean-Paul Sartre builds on this idea, and proposes that since we are responsible for our actions, we ought to constantly question things and decide what is best for ourselves. By using the purpose of discovery as our guide, we should always be ready to question, to create something new and to explore the best decision open to us. This is exactly the attitude that kept Tom Watson of IBM on a quest for that which is “beyond our present conception.” Watson’s purpose for discovery led him and his co-workers to consider situations from different angles, just as existentialists prescribe. THINK became IBM’s slogan, further emphasizing the importance of doing away with conventions and tradition to find new ways to solve customers’ problems. IBM even chose to predominantly recruit freshly graduated college students, ensuring that the status quo was constantly being challenged. Once you’ve discovered a new and innovative way to do business, you’ll need to execute it to the best of your abilities. Enter our second purpose, excellence. The ethic connected to it is virtue, developed by Greek philosopher Aristotle.  Aristotle concluded that people cultivate virtues as a means to become successful and achieve their desired end: fulfillment. In fact, Aristotle even had a particular word to describe the state of fulfillment, success and flourishing: it was called eudaimonia, and for Aristotle, this was the function of Man. By performing your vocation or role in a community to the best of your ability, you could achieve eudaimonia. But in order to get there, you had to nurture virtues, or positive characteristics; these could range from courage and honor to wittiness. Though the particular set of virtues varies depending on your modern context, it’s the time commitment necessary to gain them that is most important. Top investor Warren Buffett is a stunning example of the purpose of excellence in action. Throughout his career, he has been driven to reach fulfillment in his community by nurturing the virtues that the best investors need. His role in life is mainly to allocate capital in order to achieve the maximum return on equity. Fulfillment for Buffett is the optimal performance of that role – he strives for excellence for its own sake, not for profit. He has a fairly modest salary compared to his peers, for instance. Buffet dedicates all his actions toward excellent investment. For example, he honed his mental arithmetic skills, enabling him to remember 2,000 annual reports and all the 7,500 shareholders he is involved with. Buffet’s purpose of excellence has led him to earn $40 billion. Scottish historian and philosopher David Hume is renowned for his development of an ethic of compassion. This is connected to the purpose of altruism. For Hume, the fundamental motivation behind any action is to increase happiness. While this might sound selfish or hedonistic, our happiness is actually a function of how we’re able to make others, as well as ourselves, happy. Hume argued that we have a natural sympathy for others. Adam Smith developed this idea further through his concept of utilitarianism, which posits that the right action is the one that results in the greatest possible happiness for the greatest number of people. So, our actions are driven by the prospect of pain or pleasure that others might be exposed to. In this way, the ability to empathize is central to good decision making, especially in a business context. In the first blink, we gained an insight into how Wal-Mart achieves the success it does. Founder Sam Walton was acting in accordance with the purpose of altruism, ensuring that his decisions made as many customers happy as possible. Walton came from a relatively poor area of rural Arkansas. His upbringing gave him a powerful sense of empathy that made him determined to help as many people as possible. How? By increasing access to low-cost, quality material goods in order to improve standards of living. If his purchasers got an exceptionally good deal, instead of increasing his profit margins, he would pass the gain on to the customers as much as possible. He also ensured that this goal traveled down the company hierarchy. Management information systems were conceived so that managers would be able to focus on the needs of local customers across the US. All of Wal-Mart’s actions are centered around its customers, making Walton the David Hume of modern American business! Although many of us might find the work of German philosopher Nietzsche to be impenetrable, his ideas contain one of the most useful ethics for business leaders: heroism. This isn’t simply the desire to win, but the will to be bold and dare to do something that nobody else has tried. Nietzsche believed that only few people are truly free and thus capable of leading. Those who do not have such capabilities choose to follow those who are endowed with leadership skills. But those who do exhibit them will realize that they should exert their influence, and take on the role of leader with ambition. Henry Ford is a brilliant example of a leader with heroism as his purpose. His goal was to reshape society through his automobile, and his ambition led him to use his company as a means of exercising his will. Ford was not interested in following standard business practice or making compromises. Instead of waiting for customers to tell him what they wanted, he gave them what they didn’t know they needed. Ford pushed forward with his products in the firm belief that they would change the world.   But Ford was most interested in exerting his power, regardless of whether it would alter his company’s direction or impact social welfare, and this sometimes led him to make risky decisions. He was so determined to revolutionize the auto industry, that he recruited ex-convicts as workers, partly to rehabilitate them, but also for the benefit of his production line. Ford even went as far as hiring thugs from Detroit, which led to problems with physical violence among workers. In this way, heroism is a powerful purpose, but also one that can get out of hand when not balanced with other ethical principles. The interplay of all four purposes – discovery, excellence, altruism and heroism – will boost your company in several ways. Read on to find out how! As Prussian general and military theorist Carl von Clausewitz said, physical factors in war are “little more than the wooden hilt, while the morale factors are the precious metal, the real weapon, the finely-honed blade.” The same is true for businesses. Just as soldiers with high morale are more likely to win a battle, companies in which employees have high morale tend to be more successful. In fact, a 2003 study by insurance company Towers Perrin found a positive correlation between strong employee morale and returns to shareholders. So, the better your employees feel about their workplace, the likelier it is that your company will achieve higher returns. And, by the same token, if employees aren’t so fond of their workplace, your company’s performance could suffer: a 2002 PriceWaterhouseCoopers study found a marked correlation between absenteeism – which is linked to low morale – and below-average profit levels. But how can you ensure your employees stay engaged with their work? An effective way is to give them worthwhile reasons for doing their work by defining your company’s purposes. Take 3M, an American multinational corporation famous for its adhesives. The company’s purpose was to solve problems, a principle that their engineers truly believed in. One engineer in particular was so enthusiastic about resolving a customer issue that he ended up creating a brand new form of masking tape, which would lead to the Scotch Tape that we all have in our desk drawers today. Another employee from the same company invented the Post-it Note to solve his own problem of not finding the correct page in his hymnbook. Simply having a purpose inspired these employees to go the extra mile to make a difference and, in the process, create the products that we know and love. It often seems that the most successful companies are the most innovative ones. But while innovation is indeed a great competitive advantage, it won’t provide lasting success without purpose to back it up. Global consultancy Booz Allen Hamilton conducted a survey on the top thousand companies with the largest research and development budgets. The survey found that there was, to the surprise of many, no significant correlation between innovation and the success of the companies. So what does keep the innovative companies on top? Well, many of them make use of the purpose of discovery to drive their achievements. Take Sony for example. Founder Masaru Ibuka founded the company to “establish a place of work where engineers can feel the joy of technological innovations, be aware of their mission to society and work to their heart’s content.” This clear purpose allowed the first Sony team to be freely creative, and their journey of innovation began with Japan’s first tape recorder. A clear purpose enables innovators to radically take risks and change the rules of their industries or businesses. Sam Walton of Wal-Mart’s purpose of altruism saw him radically reinvent his industry, driven by his goal to offer the fairest possible prices to customers. At the risk of losing employees, but in order to keep prices down for his customers, he would reduce costs as much as he could during buying trips. His employees would walk rather than take taxis, and would share hotel rooms. Walton even chose to open stores in disused cattle yards and bottling plants, running the risk of a less attractive appearance than that of competitor K-Mart, but keeping prices competitively low all the while. We’d all like to know exactly how to beat the competition. Unfortunately, there’s no perfect formula, but one of the best ways for your company to achieve a sustainable advantage in the market is through strategic positioning. This simply means that your company must be at a specific position in the market that others can neither choose, nor copy. Admittedly, that’s easier said than done – but it is still doable! It starts with developing routines and relationships. By coordinating what people do and how they connect to each other, you’ll be able to unite your company under a powerful, unique strategy. A company without purpose is likely to change strategies unnecessarily. By switching between different tactical approaches in the hopes that one might stick, companies are unlikely to achieve a consistent edge over competitors. Companies without a clear purpose may also stick to old strategies, even if they’re no longer relevant. With a defined purpose, you’ll find it much easier to coordinate your organization’s routines and relationships. The values of discovery, altruism, excellence and heroism are there to guide your employees in every interaction, and in every task they complete. Thanks to a reliable, shared understanding created through values, Warren Buffett was able to manage his conglomerate with a very light touch. He didn’t have to tell his employees how to act – they already knew the best choices according to his system of values. Purpose is a reliable guide for those making the innumerable day-to-day decisions that contribute to a company’s strategic position on the market. Questions like “Should we invest in product development?” or “What kind of training should we give our customer-facing staff?” can easily be answered when your company has strong purposes in place. The key message: Whether you want your company to be a market leader, a radical innovator or a great place to work, you’ll need values that guide you along the way. The four purposes of discovery, excellence, altruism and heroism have proven to be powerful tools for some of our world’s most successful business leaders. So why not start making use of them in your own vision? Actionable advice: Uncover the purpose that drives you. Is it your passion to discover something new? Or do you want to excel at something for its own sake? Do you want to provide solutions to help the largest amount of people or do you seek to change the world by acting boldly? Think of the purpose that underpins your actions in order to understand how you can channel it into your business.

At the most basic level, a movement is what happens whenever a group of people unite around a single vision. Therefore, a movement could be based around a powerful political idea or an exciting business concept, and the leader of a movement could be either a passionate activist or an inspired entrepreneur. Dulski is well positioned to offer advice for the potential leaders of any movement since she was the former president of Change.org, the launching pad for many of today’s most popular campaigns for change. Dulski has firsthand experience with many of the issues that leaders might face, including how to gain a following and how to keep those followers motivated once they’re on board. Many people today are motivated to see change happen in their lifetime, and they’re looking for the kind of leader who will inspire them to mobilize and fight for what they believe in. So now’s the time to give action to your words and bring your ideas to life. In these blinks, you’ll find the story behind Nike’s first ad that featured a hijabi woman; how to cope with trolls and haters; and why a “festival of failure” is a good thing to be part of. There’s no shortage of great leaders and managers working today. But the real shining stars are the ones who go the extra mile and use their leadership skills to ignite a genuine movement. People are attracted to movements because they offer a sense of purpose, something we all look for in life. When we see others driven by an exciting purpose, it’s easy for that excitement to spread and catch on. Before you know it, large numbers of people are uniting and bringing about change. Manal Rostom is one of those shining stars who used purpose to ignite change. Rostom is an Egyptian Muslim woman, and for years she’s worn a hijab, a religious veil or headscarf that covers the neck and hair. But one day, Rostom began to feel a growing public resentment toward the garment, with many media outlets publishing anti-hijab articles. It got so bad that Rostom wasn’t even allowed to enter some public spaces in Dubai because of her hijab. Fed up with the negative perceptions, she decided to start a Facebook group called “Surviving Hijab” as a place where Muslim women could share their experiences and support one another. It turned out to be a popular idea: in just a few months, the group attracted 40,000 members, and today there are around 500,000. With such a positive response, Rostom saw an opportunity to go a step further. As an athletic woman, she often received annoying comments from people wondering how she could run while wearing the extra layers of clothing. Rostam was sure there were other women who could benefit from a change in the public perception that hijabi women can’t pursue sports. So, in 2015, she contacted the head of Nike’s Middle East division, Tom Woolf, and asked why there weren’t any Nike ads in the Middle East featuring hijabi women. After a productive meeting, it was decided that Rostom would become the first woman to wear a hijab in a Nike ad. But it didn’t end there. Later that year, Rostom was also made the coach of Dubai’s Nike women’s running club. And then, in 2017, Nike released a whole line of athletic wear called Nike Pro Hijab. In addition to being a leader, Rostom is a movement-starter, and it all began with a clear purpose: to show the world that faith isn’t something that gets in the way of a woman’s accomplishments. As it turned out, many people shared this feeling – so much so that a world-changing movement formed. When you think of world-changing people, you might picture Martin Luther King, Jr. or Nelson Mandela. But you don’t have to win a Nobel Peace Prize in order to make a big difference. In fact, even small actions can have a ripple effect that leads to significant consequences. Such was the change that came from the actions of Turkish activist Erdem Gündüz. In 2013, authorities in Istanbul removed tents located in Taksim Square that were being used by activists and victims of police violence. To protest this removal, Gündüz simply stood still in Taksim Square. He was soon known as the “Standing Man,” and after a couple of hours, others joined until hundreds were standing by his side in silent protest. Gündüz stood still for eight hours, and this relatively small action had the major consequence of triggering an international movement that transcended the borders of Turkey. People worldwide were inspired to stand in solidarity against police violence. As we can see from Gündüz standing still, or from 42-year-old Rosa Parks refusing to give up her seat to a white man in 1955, one person making a small gesture can have a big impact. But you don’t have to be oppressed in order to stand up against injustice. In fact, it doesn’t matter who you are or where you’re from – you can make a difference in the world. Still, many of us get stuck behind mental roadblocks, so it’s important to find a way around such barriers and not get stalled. If you come from a privileged background, you shouldn’t feel like you haven’t earned the right to speak out about the issues facing certain communities – you can still speak up on behalf of others. Don’t get hung up on where to start, either. Just take the first step and get the wheels of change in motion – that’s what’s important. Sarah Kavanaugh didn’t let self-doubt stop her from taking that step. One day, she was disturbed to discover that the popular sports drink Gatorade contained brominated vegetable oil, or BVO, an ingredient that was taken off the FDA’s “Generally Regarded as Safe” list back in 1970. Kavanaugh took her first step by going to Change.org and starting a petition to make Gatorade safer for people to enjoy. Before long, the petition had 17,000 signatures and was receiving media attention. It was enough to get the change Kavanaugh was after: Gatorade’s parent company, Pepsi, eventually removed the unsafe ingredient. If having purpose is the first ingredient to change, the second essential ingredient is a well-defined vision. While purpose should answer the question of why you want to take action, vision answers the question of what the future looks like after action has been taken and change sets in. Neil Grimmer decided to take action after he couldn’t find healthy organic baby food in his local shops. So he decided to start his own baby-food company, Plum Organics. In this case, Grimmer’s purpose was for parents to have healthy food for their babies. His vision was a future where the shelves of grocery stores were well stocked with organic baby food. A well-defined vision is like a compass; it keeps you on track throughout the process of creating your movement. This is why you should have a clear vision before you start. Once you’ve started, a good way to get people on board is to use storytelling to communicate your vision. With the aid of storytelling, you can demonstrate how your vision will impact others while getting your purpose across more persuasively than by simply stating your desired goal. Certainly, the tragic story behind the “Kari’s Law” Act was a major reason the legislation managed to get passed in 2017. It all began four years earlier, when Kari, the mother of three young children, was killed in a hotel room by her husband. Kari’s kids ranged from age two to age nine, and they were in the adjoining room while Kari was being attacked. The oldest child tried to use the hotel phone to call the police but wasn’t able to get through because he didn’t know that he needed to dial nine in order to get an outside line. As Kari’s father, Hank Hunt, explained when introducing the legislation behind Kari’s Law, had there been no need to dial nine, his daughter might still have been alive. This was his purpose, and his vision was to ban any hotels or other business from requiring clients to dial extra numbers when making phone calls. Hunt’s harrowing story deeply connected people to his vision, as anyone who heard it immediately wanted to help. It’s a big reason why Kari’s Law is now a federal law in the United States. If you want to change the world, you may think that playing it nice won’t get you very far. But you shouldn’t underestimate the power of a positive attitude, especially when trying to convince people in power to help you. When you approach them respectfully, people will be far more receptive to your ideas, as well as more willing to work with you. This positive attitude means you should avoid thinking of decision-makers, such as politicians and CEOs, as “targets” that need to be forcibly convinced to do what you want them to. For example, attacking someone on Twitter is unlikely to provoke the change you’re looking for. In fact, it’s likely to kill your chances of working with that person now or in the future. Remember, many decision-makers are elected officials and public servants, whose job it is to help. So don’t get off on the wrong foot by thinking they’re inaccessible to the public and will never listen to your story. There are a number of respectful and effective ways to get the attention of decision-makers, such as peaceful demonstrations, organized phone calls, boycotts and signing petitions. Any of these methods could very well lead to a fruitful relationship with those in charge. To make your efforts even more efficient, you should map out all the relevant influencers, including people and organizations, that could possibly help your cause. Sometimes, the obvious person isn’t available or receptive, so it helps to have options. Jennifer Tyrrell was an effective agent of change because she pursued multiple avenues after she was let go by the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) when they discovered she was gay. Looking to change this discriminatory policy, Tyrrell started a petition on Change.org, but it was soon clear that dealing with BSA executives directly wasn’t effective. So she began reaching out to people on the BSA board of directors, like the CEOs of AT&T and Ernst & Young. Unlike the conservative BSA executives, these CEOs were known to support LGBTQ rights, and after Tyrrell urged them to speak out against BSA’s policies, they did just that. For good measure, Tyrrell also reached out to other LGBTQ-friendly companies that partnered with BSA, like UPS and Intel. And sure enough, they spoke up as well. Eventually, in 2013, Tyrrell’s vision was realized when BSA voted to allow gay people into their community. Getting people on board is only the start of a successful movement – you also have to know how to keep those people motivated and engaged for the duration of the movement. To sustain people’s motivation, you need to remind them of three important things about your movement: its members’ shared purpose, their continued personal growth and their strong interpersonal connections. First of all, while purpose attracts people to your movement, it’s also a big factor for keeping them motivated. When people share a purpose, it makes them feel united and as though they’re part of something important, even if the people come from widely different backgrounds. So don’t pass up a chance to remind people of that shared purpose. After Neil Grimmer started his Plum Organics baby-food business, he would remind his team about the shared purpose at company meetings every Monday morning, making it a strong, motivating start to the workweek. Next is to make sure people are growing and continuing to learn. When people recognize that your movement is helping them grow as individuals, they’ll feel more of an incentive to continue fighting for your cause – so be sure to keep challenging them. While the author was working at Change.org, she started an initiative called the 90/10 model for decision-making. It meant that every employee is expected to make 90 percent of the necessary decisions for them to be successful in their jobs. Yes, this put a lot of responsibility in employee hands, but it also challenged them to rise to the occasion. And this ensured that they were always learning and growing on the job. Finally, it’s important to create an environment where you and your team members can forge strong connections. Genuine relationships create an atmosphere of trust, which allows people to feel safer to take risks and be open and honest. This environment benefits everyone. According to a recent study at Google, the highest performers are those who feel psychologically safe. This can apply to online-based movements as well: Facebook has found that its most successful groups are ones with active administrators who create a safe and rewarding environment. They’re welcoming to new members, they ban bad behavior and they continually add new and relevant content. By making members feel comfortable and safe, such administrators set the stage for people to make strong, genuine and lasting connections. No one likes to be on the receiving end of harsh criticism, but when you’re starting a movement, criticism is practically inevitable. No matter your purpose and vision, you’re bound to encounter someone who either opposes your idea or disagrees with your approach. These days, there are two kinds of criticism: there’s the positive and constructive feedback, and then there are the “trolls” and “haters” who offer nothing constructive and only criticize in order to drag others down. So what should you do when the inevitable happens and you’re faced with an obnoxious troll? You stay positive by keeping your supporters in mind. The author spoke to plenty of petition starters while working at Change.org, and nearly all of them relied on the positive feedback of supporters when they were forced to deal with the comments of haters and trolls. By reading and rereading the positive remarks, you can remind yourself of your legion of supporters and not lose sight of the fact that haters don’t speak for everyone. It’s also worth keeping in mind that sometimes criticism can be used to your advantage. Kara Goldin did exactly that when she was considering the next step for her unique beverage company. In 2005, Goldin founded Hint Water, which came as a response to being bored with normal water but still wanting to avoid sugary drinks. Hint Water gets its name from the hint of fruit flavor it has, even though it contains no sugar or artificial sweeteners. When Goldin was exploring the option of selling her business to one of the larger beverage corporations, she was told by a high-ranking executive that they weren’t interested in Hint Water because Americans love sweet drinks and sweet drinks only. Goldin could have been discouraged by this patronizing, closed-minded remark, but instead she saw it as an opportunity. If beverage executives were under this impression and only interested in selling sweet drinks, then she could market Hint Water as a refreshing alternative and have very little competition. After all, Goldin was an American who didn’t only love sweet drinks, and she was pretty sure there were others like her. Goldin’s courage to move forward on her own paid off handsomely. Hint Water became part of a big health and wellness movement in the United States, and its value has been estimated at $100 million. Life doesn’t move in a straight line. It’s filled with ups and downs, especially when you’re trying to start a movement. So don’t be surprised if you stumble when trying to come out of the gate with a new idea. And remember, you’re not alone – every entrepreneur and leader has taken a fall at one time or another. Once you understand that obstacles are bound to appear, you can then be ready to react as best you can. The author refers to rebounding from downfalls as Rocky Moments – as in Rocky Balboa. Every one of these moments has two parts. First comes the failure, which is when you’re down and any possible success seems distant and unlikely. But if you continue to fight, you’ll eventually come to the second part, when you turn things around and triumphantly get back on your feet. Failure doesn’t mean you’re finished. In fact, you can emerge smarter by having understood what went wrong and being equipped to overcome future challenges. Therefore, you should take a close look at the reasons for the failure and share your insight with others. By being open about mistakes with your peers, you’ll be in a position to learn from their mistakes and avoid those potential pitfalls. At Change.org, there’s a regular company-wide event called the “Festival of Failure,” where people come together to share their worst experiences and downfalls. There are also smaller versions of this concept that take place between different divisions, like software engineers who share bad code experiences and discuss what went wrong and what they learned. So, when you encounter a Rocky Moment, remember that there are others out there who not only can offer support, but can help you learn from the experience. Finally, let’s consider the case of Olga Rybkovskaya, who reached out for help during a difficult time in her movement. Rybkovskaya was using Change.org to petition the Russian Ministry of Health to change a law that prohibits families from visiting intensive-care patients in the hospital. She knew success wouldn’t be easy since it would require the drawing up of new policies and guidelines. But rather than despair at the difficulties of this challenge, Rybkovskaya took a chance and reached out to the lawyers who’d signed her petition. Amazingly, she was able to get 30 lawyers to volunteer and help create the documents she needed. Olga wasn’t alone in her movement, and neither are you. If there’s change you want to see in the world, now’s the time to take action. The key message in these blinks: Anybody can start a movement. All you need is a collaborative spirit and the right strategic approach. It starts by defining your vision and moving past any doubts about the validity of your voice or ideas. If at first you fail, don’t despair. Instead, learn from your failure and use that knowledge to keep moving forward. With determination, you can make the social change you and others desire for the future, whether it’s starting a new business or changing an unjust law. Actionable advice: Ignore irrelevant criticism! Sometimes you’ll receive criticism that is helpful but delivered in a mean and unconstructive way. Even if that’s uncool, it’s still worth considering it as feedback. However, if the criticism is irrelevant, such as a comment about your appearance, just ignore it. It’s not worth your time and energy, and it won’t help you to reach your goal. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Some see the sensitive and quiet type as their ideal boss, and others hold the drill-sergeant in high esteem. But in these blinks, the case is made for the radically candid boss – the boss who can be both caring and direct and combine bluntness with empathy. You’ll find out why radical candor is something you need in your workplace, how to practice it on a day-to-day basis, and how it’ll help you handle the inevitable challenges of leadership. You’ll also learn why a fear of hurting people can create the most suffering; when and why it’s OK to fire someone; and how ten minutes of silent listening can benefit your leadership skills. Are you the kind of manager who arrives at the office feeling joyful and excited about the opportunity to shepherd your team through another great day of work? This may not be an accurate description of your current routine, but it’s a good example of how things could be once you start using radical candor. At the heart of radical candor are two principles: a manager should personally care about their employees and challenge them in their work. While it’s true that there are no simple solutions guaranteed to work for everyone, these principles are a great way of developing trusting relationships in the workplace. And even though different people have unique personalities and reactions, radical candor can help any manager improve their relationship with just about any employee. So, the first step is to become more than just a coworker by establishing personal relationships that prove you genuinely care. This means opening up, sharing and talking about more than just business. Contrary to what some may think, a good working relationship is a highly personal one. However, a good manager must also be willing to challenge their employees when they’re not meeting expectations. This can be difficult for managers. Being candid and direct doesn’t always feel like friendly and caring behavior. But as we’ll explore further, challenging your staff to be their best is indeed the hallmark of a boss who truly cares. We’ll also look at the many benefits radical candor has for performance and office culture. By being honest and direct with your employees, you’ll find that new lines of communication readily open up. Staff will be quick and willing to accept your feedback, and they’ll feel free to offer feedback regarding your work as team leader. This attitude will spread throughout your workforce. When you’re radically candid with your staff, they’ll soon become radically candid among themselves, which makes for a healthy, productive and efficient work environment. So, now that you know the basic principles let’s dive in and have a closer look. If you have experience as a manager, then chances are you know what it’s like to have someone react aggressively or defensively to constructive feedback. Even when your intentions are positive, there’s a delicate skill to providing guidance and criticism while coming across as helpful, rather than mean. And this is exactly what radical candor can achieve. When the author, Kim Scott, was first starting out as a manager for Google, she had a boss who was brilliant at delivering feedback with radical candor. Once, after Scott delivered a successful presentation, her boss took her aside to give her some constructive criticism. But her boss didn’t just blurt it out; she began by honestly complimenting Scott’s performance and the way she handled the questions from the audience. Only then did she bring up the criticism, which was about Scott’s habit of saying “um . . . ” too often. At first, Scott didn’t think this was too important – after all, the presentation went well. But then her boss elaborated: When someone says “um” too often, they can sound dumb, which would be a shame, especially when they’re as smart as Scott. This kind of comment is radical candor at its best. She made her point clear while managing to compliment Scott at the same time, and the author was soon working with a speech coach to become even better at her job. This example shows us how radical candor gets results by being open, honest and direct. First of all, Scott’s boss didn’t let the overall success of the presentation discourage her from pointing out how it could have been even better. And she didn’t wait to provide feedback, either, which allowed Scott to immediately improve her performance. Perhaps most importantly, her boss was honest and direct about both the positive and negative aspects of the work, and she didn’t sugar coat anything. This ensured that Scott got the point and didn’t mistake it for a personal attack. Anyone who’s seen the movie The Devil Wears Prada has seen a good example of a toxic workplace. The film features a terrifying and abusive boss played by Meryl Streep and based on Anna Wintour, the editor of Vogue magazine. This depiction of leadership is quite the opposite of radical candor; being honest and direct does not give you the right to be obnoxiously aggressive. Remember, radical candor is about expressing care for your staff, as well as being open and direct. Ultimately, when a boss humiliates an employee with their criticism, they create enemies, destroy morale and cause people to quit their job. However, if you have to choose between being an unpopular asshole who tells it like it is or being a friendly boss who can’t be critical of your staff, choose being unpopular. In the long run, it will be better for business and everyone involved if you are clear and honest. But, of course, radical candor is the best of all options. Other behavior traits that a successful boss should avoid are manipulative insincerity and ruinous empathy. Manipulative insincerity is another result of not caring and not challenging your employees to help them grow as professionals; it often stems from the manager being lazy. For example, if an employee gives a poor presentation, a manager with manipulative insincerity may respond by saying it was adequate. They’ll do this because it’s easier than getting into a discussion about what needs to be improved. A manager with ruinous empathy, on the other hand, will avoid conflict not out of laziness, but rather out of a misplaced fear of hurting an employee’s feelings. Yet the result of ruinous empathy is that the employee will only suffer more due to a lack of improvement. When a boss refuses to be critical of an employee whose performance is deteriorating, that employee will only grow more incompetent until the manager is forced to fire them. So if you truly care about an employee, being honest is always in their best interest. In a perfect world, everyone would have a fulfilling job for which they have genuine passion. But in reality, some jobs are tedious, and it isn’t the manager’s role to make them appear otherwise. Being radically candid means that you’re honest and don’t sugarcoat things to motivate your employees. Having a job with meaning and a noble purpose can inspire employees to perform to their best ability, but it’s not up to you to manufacture that meaning and purpose when they’re not there. Doing so can backfire and make matters worse. When the author was a manager in Google’s customer support department, she tried to manufacture meaning and convince her staff that their work was of vital importance to Google’s creative workers. But at least one employee saw right through her phony pep talk. And he was absolutely correct when he told her that it would be better to tell the truth and admit that a lot of necessary jobs can be tedious and unfulfilling. There’s no use dodging the fact that some jobs have only one reward: earning enough money to pay the bills and live comfortably. So be honest with your employees and tell them that there is still satisfaction to be had in doing a job well, and make sure that good work is acknowledged. There’s no need to feel you must solve your employees’ existential dilemmas. However, you can provide them with perspective on their careers and the tools to help them grow and develop as professionals. To do this honestly, you’ll need to spot the difference between a superstar and a rockstar. Superstar employees need to be challenged and permitted to grow quickly so they can move up the corporate ladder and reach their full potential. Rockstar employees offer a steadier presence, and they will be great as long as they’re given the stability and time to excel at the job they’re given. Up next, we’ll look at a different employee, the falling star. If you’ve been fired, there’s a good chance you felt some animosity toward your ex-boss. This is a natural reaction, but it can blind us to the fact that this likely wasn’t the outcome that the boss wanted, either. Any manager will tell you that firing people is one of the hardest parts of the job. Firing someone is tough because you’re making someone else’s life incredibly difficult, even if it’s only temporarily. And in many cases, it’s not only the employee who’s suffering but their spouse and children too. Not only are you taking away a source of money, but entire families can lose health insurance, and the whole incident can cause all sorts of marital strife. This is why a manager needs to ensure someone is fired for the right reason. It’s also important to remember that other employees are aware when someone is let go, so the incident should still reflect you as being an honest and caring boss. For this to happen, you need to consider three main points before a firing takes place. First of all, every effort should be made to help the employee improve their performance. This shows that you care and that firing is your last resort. As always, you should use radical candor to support their good work and be honest and direct in how they can improve, while avoiding any personal attacks. Second, you need to consider the effect a bad employee has on the overall team. If the person is an annoying and demoralizing presence, then it makes sense to let them go. The third aspect to consider is an outside opinion. If you have any doubts, it’s good to bring in an impartial third party and get their opinion on the matter. When all of this is taken into consideration, you should have a clear understanding of what needs to be done. No one wants to be involved in a firing, but there’s also a good chance that the departing employee needs to find a job that better suits his skills. There’s a good way and a bad way to approach team leadership. The bad approach is to think of it as an opportunity to boss people around. The right approach is to see your team as a great opportunity to collaborate with talented individuals. Nevertheless, many managers mistakenly believe their job is to tell people what to do, which will only lead to problems since leaders make mistakes. Steve Jobs knew he could be wrong, so he relied on his team to speak up and challenge him when they disagreed with his ideas. On at least one occasion, Jobs was furious when an employee gave up and let him win an argument because it later turned out the employee was right. Jobs had to remind the employee that he was hired to ensure Jobs didn’t make these kinds of mistakes, and not back down from a fight. So, how do you lead a team without giving orders? It might sound like a paradox, but the answer is collaborative leadership, and there is an art to practicing it. The first step is to really listen to what the people in your team have to say. When you do this, your team will feel safe to speak their minds and have the kind of discussions that lead to brilliant ideas. The second step is to give your team the time and space to develop their ideas. Otherwise, they can end up being shot down before they ever have a chance to be clearly understood. The third step is to allow for healthy debate so that the best ideas are presented and agreed upon. The final step is for you, the manager, to persuade other company executives that your team’s idea is worth pushing forward. Then it’s up to you to execute the idea and make sure everyone gains valuable insight from the results. This process gets repeated over and over again. There are a lot of tutorials on how a boss should speak, yet knowing how to listen is just as important. The first thing you should know is there are two ways of listening, and you should practice the one that suits your personality. On the one hand, there is quiet listening, which suits leaders who prefer to let others do the talking. Apple CEO, Tim Cook, is one such leader. He’s notorious for using painfully long stretches of silence to get others talking. If you’re practicing quiet listening, you should spend at least ten minutes of an hour-long conversation patiently listening to what the other person has to say. This is especially useful for people who want honest opinions. Too often, managers will interrupt people and share their own opinions. As a result, those who are talking will change their message to match the manager’s opinion. So, for quiet listening to work, you must provide the encouragement and freedom for your team to feel comfortable saying what’s truly on their mind. Only then can you settle in for a good, quiet listen. Loud listening, on the other hand, is good for leaders with a more confrontational personality. This was how Steve Jobs listened. He would make a strong statement and insist that others provide an equally strong response to keep the discussion going. Since loud listening pushes people into talking, it is an effective way to draw shy employees out of their shells. However, you will need to instill confidence in your teammates if you want them to speak up. For this to happen, you’ll need to respond positively to their opinions, even if you don’t agree with them, so that they’ll continue to speak up and challenge your ideas. Listening to your employees is key to promoting an effective and creative team. And as we’ll see in the final blink, it also puts you in a position to help move their careers forward. While there’s nothing wrong with working a job just to pay the bills, you’re bound to have people in your team who have big dreams they’re hoping to realize. Managers should support the dreams of their staff and help them approach those dreams in a realistic fashion. To do this, you must first talk (and listen) to your employees so that you understand their aspirations, and they know that you are personally invested in helping them get on the right path. When Russ Laraway was the director of sales at Google, he used career talks as a way to help keep his team motivated. One of his employees was Sarah, and when he asked about her aspirations, she initially responded with some hesitation and said she hoped to one day be a boss, like Russ. But Russ sensed that Sarah wasn’t being completely honest with him, so he asked her if she had any other visions for her future. Sure enough, Sarah described her dream of owning a farm that grew spirulina, an algae-like super food. Russ was now able to talk to Sarah about her upbringing and identify her main motivators, such as helping the environment, working hard, and being a financially independent leader. With this in mind, they could now focus on developing Sarah’s management skills rather than her analytical skills to make sure her current job was preparing her for running that spirulina farm. To understand your employees’ dreams and identify those important motivators, use one of three kinds of conversations. The first is the life story conversation where the employee tells you everything leading up to the present day, and you try to find their motivating factors. The second is the dream job conversation, where they describe their biggest career desire. The third is the 18-month plan conversation, where they look into the immediate future, and you identify everything that can be done to keep them on the right track. By following these guidelines, it won’t be long before you have a team of highly motivated individuals working together and achieving great things. The key message in this book: By using radical candor, you can become the best possible boss. Radical candor helps you listen and express genuine care for your employees. It also allows you to directly challenge your staff members in a constructive way to which they’ll be receptive. This makes leadership a collaborative and personal process that brings out the best in everyone. Actionable advice: Have a growth plan for your employees.  Don’t just think of your staff as people who are only there to do what you assign them to do. Think of them as individuals on a career path and work with them to develop a plan that keeps that career on track. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Reboot promises to help you find your feet again, through the process of radical self-inquiry. Rather than the quick tips and management strategies that so many leadership books provide, Reboot shows you how to look deeply into yourself and ask the fundamental questions. What has shaped you as a human being? Why are you irrational sometimes? How do you act in times of crisis?  It’s only by dealing with these essential questions that you can grow as a human being and leader. And it’s only in this way that we can rethink and redefine our approach to leadership, and create a less toxic, more forgiving workplace. In these blinks, you’ll learn how the Buddhist saint Milarepa conquered the demons in his cave;  why standing still can be the best thing for us; and why horses choose the best leaders. At the leadership workshops that author Jerry Colonna runs across the United States, a CEO will sometimes interrupt him and demand a quick fix to her problems. As a high-powered executive, she just can’t understand why her world seems to be falling apart. She wants to know the “One Quick Trick” to remedy this feeling of professional anxiety or helplessness. But Jerry tells her, kindly but firmly, that there is no immediate fix, no “One Quick Trick” that will solve it. What he recommends instead is called radical self-inquiry. This process is often difficult for CEOs and business leaders. To rise to the very top of an organization, or to make it as an entrepreneur, requires a certain degree of mental toughness. This means hiding deeper feelings, locking up vulnerability – focusing only on the practical how of running an organization and forgetting the more fundamental why.  What can happen, then, is that underlying psychological problems begin to accumulate and make themselves felt in the workplace. This might manifest in overbearing professional oversight, a lack of connection with the team, or irrational, emotive decisions. To understand these problems, leaders need to go right back to the roots of who they are. They need to move beyond the illusory stories they tell about themselves and look at the difficult truths that have shaped them. As the author has found at his workshops, the reason why a high-powered executive may feel anxious often isn’t because of something specific in running an organization, but because of unresolved trauma from childhood. A hectoring father. A whole year at school being bullied. Poverty. Loneliness. When the author conducted his own radical self-inquiry after a personal crisis in 2002, he found that his feelings of professional anxiety were linked to his poverty as a child growing up in Queens. Even though he’d become successful, he was still troubled by the latent memory of having little to eat or the ferocious arguments he witnessed his parents having over money. What was driving him, but also fuelling terrible anxiety, was this old fear of being left with nothing. So rather than digging desperately through management books to solve seemingly inscrutable problems, we need to pause, take a deep breath – then peer beneath the surface into who we really are. Sometimes, in the middle of a successful career, something comes along and turns everything on its head. Our company falters. We’re fired by the board. The investors pull the funding. But in the midst of such crisis, true leadership qualities can be born. Just consider the case of a good friend of the author, Chad Dickerson, the former CEO of the e-commerce website Etsy. When Etsy’s board fired him, rather than sinking into depression and inactivity, he continued to work late into the night during his few remaining weeks at the company, looking out for his colleagues and making sure that company data was correct. He remained as solidly reliable as he always had been. Such moments of crisis are the great tests of leadership – if we can emerge from them with grace and steadfastness, then no matter the severity of the blow, we’ll become better leaders, and better people. This is what leadership expert Warren Bennis calls the crucible moment. It’s only under extreme pressure that we learn that we can face the worst with courage, humility and inspiration. We come out the other side with new confidence. It’s always best to face the crisis head-on. Take the tale of Milarepa, the tenth-century Buddhist saint and teacher. One day he left his meditation cave to gather firewood, then returned to find it full of demons. He waved his arms at them, trying to shoo them out. But they stayed put, and simply multiplied. So he taught them Buddhism. And the demons sat down and were quiet.  But they didn’t leave. So Milarepa asked them, “What are you here to teach me?” Stumped, the demons began to disappear, except for one enormous demon with great fangs. Exasperated, Milarepa put his head in the demon’s mouth and said, “Eat me if you wish.” With that, the demon vanished. Milarepa surrendered to his demon and was rewarded with this freedom. As a leader, you too can choose to face your demons head-on. For instance, if you’re in a business partnership that has become toxic, the best thing to do is put your head in the demon’s mouth, so to speak, by confronting your partner. You’ll either resolve the relationship, or it will break. But either is preferable to stumbling on in toxicity. We often feel uncomfortable if we’re not getting on with something – answering the next email, developing a new project, looking for promotion. We go on like this, day after day, in a blur of activity. But then we can lose track of who we are, and why we’re doing what we do. Often we rush ahead, from one thing to the next, to escape something.  The author recounts a client he had – a young CEO in charge of a new start-up – who’d come to him because he was suffering from a general unease in his professional life. Upon further investigation, it turned out that he barely got to see his partner, a woman he loved very much. He’d simply buried himself in work.  When the author asked the client why he didn’t make time to see her, he told Colonna that he was trying to outrun the past. “I’m afraid that if I don’t work hard, I’ll end up back there,” he said. Back there was his childhood, in a faraway country destroyed by war, where he’d also been bed-bound with cancer for many years.  Though this is an extreme example, it’s illustrative of a feeling many professionals have. You have to keep moving, keep doing – otherwise, you’ll slip back to some dark place.  But this endless movement leads to a toxic work environment. If you’re always rushing ahead, it can leave others with the impression that they’re not moving fast enough. The faster you seem to be moving – burning through meetings, conferences, interviews, etc. – the slower everyone else feels. And the slower they feel, the more they think they must catch up.  The result is a work culture in which no one takes a moment to figure out why they’re doing what they’re doing. Everyone is caught in the rush – like a frightened herd of wildebeest, they trample over their colleagues. And although it is inspiring to keep reaching, to have real ambition – to go for the “moon-shot,” in corporate parlance – it’s less inspiring if, in reaching, you lose your footing and bring everyone else down with you. Instead, you must have the courage to be still. So for a moment each day, practice mindfulness and just listen to yourself. Where is it you are heading in such a rush? Think of those times when a lie – a white one, or worse – has caught up with you and made you wish the earth would just swallow you then and there. What you learn is that at some point – often when we’re least expecting it – the lie will wind its way toward you. You learn the hard way that it is better to be truthful. As a leader, you should always be comfortable with the truth. Think of those stories of corporate malfeasance – like VW’s infamous cover-up of diesel emissions, in which the company deceived emissions regulators about their vehicles. Think of those times corporate leadership told employees, investors and government a complicated web of lies.  Then picture the consequences of that deceit: an oil spill from a tanker choking fish and seabirds, because regulatory guidelines had been flouted, or the bankruptcy that means hundreds of employees are suddenly without a livelihood. People, whole communities and the planet suffer because someone high up hasn’t been able to face the truth. This culture of deceit begins at the top, so it is at the top that change needs to happen. And that change is personal, before it is anything else. It begins with facing reality, and having the courage to turn away from the delusionary dreams that have kept things heading slowly, like the Titanic, toward disaster. Consequently, a new culture of honesty needs to pervade our workplaces. This is what the author calls broken-open-hearted warriorship, where leadership figures are unafraid to be vulnerable, truthful and strong at the same time. A great example of this comes from one of the author’s leadership workshops. There, a young woman confessed that she’d recently been diagnosed with a rare blood cancer. She was terrified of telling her company’s investors in case they withdrew their support. Only a few people, including her husband and some close friends, had known about her illness, until this moment at the leadership workshop.  In the months that followed, inspired by the author’s call to honesty, she shared her story with her colleagues and, eventually, her investors. Rather than panicking and pulling out, the investors rallied ‘round and supported her. Vitally, she’d broken the spell of deception. She’d made the first move toward a culture of broken-open-hearted warriorship. And she was rewarded for it. Remember those arguments in which you’re hollering at your partner, parent or sibling, and then, in the midst of it, both of you simply burst out laughing? You both know how silly and irrational the whole thing is.  Well, irrationality doesn’t stop there.  There are parts of us, bits of leftover, residual psychology, carried with us from childhood. These old habits, fears and complexes were forged in us when we were young. This mirrors what software developers (borrowing from the writer Arthur Koestler) call “ghosts in the machine,” referring to bits of outmoded code dormant in the current version of a program. While it was once useful in the program’s development, this defunct coding can interfere with current operations. For the author, his own bit of defunct coding can be traced to his childhood in Queens. As a boy, he’d watch his father sit at the table and obsessively correct all the typos in the newspaper, as a way to take charge of something in a life marked by the powerlessness that comes with poverty.  As the author grew up, he noticed how, much like his father, he would pedantically correct colleagues, picking at them for the slightest things. It was a form of hypervigilance that occasionally served him well, but also caused professional tensions. Well, we all have these ghosts in the machine – every one of us. This irrationality, with its irritating habits, complexes and fears, is everywhere. We’re essentially messy, asymmetrical beings. And to survive our professional lives, we have to accept this fact about ourselves, and about the people we work with. For instance, the author coached a business partnership, a man and woman who couldn’t stand each other but needed each other professionally. As he interviewed them, he found that, deep down, the man reminded the woman of her father, and the woman reminded the man of his mother. They’d been drawn together as business students, many years ago, and were now driving each other nuts. They’d both unconsciously replicated patterns and old complexes. Now, to survive as a business partnership, they needed to accept this bit of old coding. Rather than storming out of meetings and hollering at each other, they learned mindfulness. They learned how each of them was complicit in this dynamic. And guess what? They overcame it. Sometimes life is all set out: success, a family, a beautiful house. But then – crash – we find that this isn’t enough. The life we’ve carefully made, with its routine and certainties, has stifled us. So how do we find ourselves again? We need to embrace not-knowing. Take the author’s story. From journalist to magazine editor to venture capitalist, he’d moved from one thing to another, always having to know his next move professionally. Without pausing, he made sure his days were filled with plans and strategies, which led him to professional prestige and material riches.  However, in early 2002, he found himself balanced on the rim of the still-smoking crater of Ground Zero in Manhattan, contemplating suicide. His life had become regimented, lacking something integral. For years, it had rushed before him, from one board meeting to the next, without feeling like it belonged to him. But rather than ending his life that day, he went on a personal journey. He traveled: he crossed the ice caps, rafted across Chilean rivers and learned to meditate. Crucially, he embraced not-knowing. Rather than living for an endlessly scheduled future, he learned to take things one at a time, and embrace the infinite potential of the present.  A part of this great change meant letting go of mistakes and regrets, and moving on – just like in his childhood games of stickball on a Brooklyn street, where, after a period of intense debate over whether something was a foul or a hit, his friend would shout, “Do-over!” That meant it was time to move on, time to start again. And so the logic of the “do-over,” in which we forgive, forget and move on, is something that he applies to life now. Rather than getting hung up on something, he gives himself one of these do-overs – he hits refresh. This is a crucial aspect of the pathless path, the one we take when we move forward refreshed, open to change, attentive to the moment. It means being mobile, ready to say yes to fortuitous events. Let’s say that you’re an investment banker and your life seems to be plotted out in neat, predictable segments. It all feels terribly stifling. Well, as the poet Rilke emphatically puts it, You must change your life. You, like the author, can embrace the pathless path. We all go through life plagued by doubt. We may constantly believe we lack our colleagues’ admiration or think we’re underachieving. But what can we do about it? First, we must learn to embrace our personal Crow. When he was in college, Colonna took writing courses with the poet Marie Ponsot. She’d talk about a Crow that sits on our shoulder, cawing things like, “That’s nonsense,” and “How could you write that?” And she would tell her students emphatically: “Shoot. The. Damned. Crow.” For the author, the Crow is the niggling voice at the back of our minds. The one that says we’re unworthy of success or love, and don’t deserve to belong anywhere.  However, the author decided not to shoot his Crow. He reasoned that the Crow signifies the insistent self-criticism that comes from caring about our actions in the world – because we’re invested in what we do. Thus, we should learn to accommodate and live with our Crow, because it’s a part of our flawed, though basically good, humanity. Next, we must learn to embrace our Loyal Soldier. The figure of the Loyal Soldier is another metaphor the author deploys to describe the way our minds work. It uses the image of a soldier, cut off from his regiment, defending an isolated rock just off an island, armed with only an old rifle.  Convinced that war is still raging back on the mainland, the soldier maintains his watch on the rock, oiling his rifle, keeping up his routines, drilling himself in the rules of survival. These rules are: Stay small, don’t stand out, don’t make mistakes. The Loyal Soldier embodies our survival strategies. We might see him as the voice that makes us too cautious or unwilling to stand out. However, like the Crow, which is the voice of self-criticism, the Loyal Soldier – the instinct for self-preservation – is a natural part of us all. Rather than trying to reject him, we should learn to accommodate him in a spirit of acceptance. We should remember that he’s just like a protective parent saying, “Don’t hurt yourself.”  So, by acknowledging our Crows and Loyal Soldiers, and not beating ourselves up if we have a negative thought or a moment of doubt, we can be more at ease with ourselves and face the world with courage and openness. Think of the CEO whose fearful presence makes employees shrink in their chairs, stop chewing gum, take their feet off the desks. These might be the heroes of Hollywood movies, but what if we’ve outgrown this leadership style? Let’s consider an alternative. What if, rather than inspiring fear, leaders created a space where others on their team could open up and grow?  Just think of the family home, where loving parents create a space in which their children can become fully themselves – where they can try on silly faces, make dumb mistakes and ask endless questions without fear of being cut down and diminished. Or consider the relationship that exists between partners. We allow space for both darkness and light, and trust that our whole irrational, messy selves will be accepted and loved. And sure, it takes a special kind of bravery to create this space in a corporate environment. But by living in this embracing, unsheltered way, we create much more fulfilling, authentic workplaces.  As well as allowing individual members to open up and flourish, the best leaders also allow the group to work as an organic whole. This means corporate leaders who can understand their teams intuitively and with compassion.  In the animal kingdom, we find this kind of leader within a herd of horses. With their specially attuned nervous systems, horses possess an almost supernatural ability to discern things. It seems that they can tell the moods of other horses and their riders – or predict a coming storm.  And this sensitivity is illustrated in the type of leader they choose. They never select the horse that appears to be the smartest, or the strongest, the one that could protect them from wolves, or the one with the showiest mane. Instead, they choose the horse – nearly always a mare – that feels the group best. It’s the one that can calm the herd intuitively, that knows the needs of each horse and can lead them as a whole. In human terms, this type of leadership is a real departure from the competitive, individualistic culture that permeates the corporate world. But perhaps it offers a roadmap by which we can move beyond the toxicity of so many workplaces. Perhaps it’s where the future lies. The key message in these blinks: To grow as leaders, we need to be more mindful human beings who pay close attention to the things that have shaped our present behavior. This will improve and deepen the way we interact with colleagues and how we lead the team as a whole. Above all else, it pays to become more humane, courageous people, because that is the path to less-toxic workplaces and companies that act responsibly regarding their employees, communities and the environment.  Actionable advice: Make time for yourself outside of work. Don’t be afraid to just enjoy a box of candy, a foot massage or a crime thriller. There is no shame in nourishing the parts of yourself that can’t be fulfilled with a big promotion or a pat on the back from the boss. We’re human beings with diverse needs: don’t neglect the parts of you that work shuts down. You could even head to the bakery this instant! Got feedback?

Well, there are companies out there who are happy to do this for you – and no, we’re not talking about insurance fraud. These kinds of companies are known as red teams, groups of specialists hired by organizations to plan a bomb attack or a similar catastrophe as a way to find out about any security gaps in an organization, or the weak points in a business strategy. In these blinks, you’ll find out how red teams work, what they can do for many government organizations, how they help to keep us all safe from terrorists and why they constantly face criticism and resistance. You’ll also learn about the link between red teamers and method actors; why your government might be making plans to kill you; and how your last flight via Frankfurt may have been a lot riskier than you thought. As humans, we’ve got a rather peculiar blind spot for our own mistakes. This is why, for example, we get friends to proofread our essays in university. And it’s also why organizations hire red teams, groups of experts whose job it is to work out the weaknesses in a company’s strategies, structures and security measures. Though red teams can be incredibly effective, many leaders are reluctant to accept their help. Authoritarian figures or personalities don’t enjoy being contradicted and often refuse to enlist red teams in the first place. This was the case with the head of Federal Aviation Administration. It took a terrorist attack on a Pan-American Airway plane in 1988 with 270 fatalities before he decided to bring a red team into his regular operations to uncover security weaknesses. Red teams also require the right members in order to be effective. Red teamers are those who can think outside the box, and there are fewer of those people around than you might think. Psychologist Scott Eidelman demonstrated how we often fall victim to existence bias by assuming things are fine just the way they are. An excellent red teamer does not have this bias. Instead, they have an incredible eye for detail when it comes to working out what could be done better. Red teamers must, of course, be able to think like the enemy. CIA analyst Rodney Faraon even likens sharp red teamers to method actors capable of immersing themselves in the minds and identities of someone else. In the case of a red teamer, they’re becoming one with the enemy. Finally, organizations must ensure that red teams play an appropriate role in day-to-day life. Being assessed is stressful for both leaders and employees, so don’t let your red team run rife! Restrict them to where their expertise is needed to keep staff from feeling like they’re under constant surveillance. What comes to your mind when you think of the US military? For many people, the instant association is with blind loyalty, absurd rituals and old men rambling on about the good old days when people stood up for their nation. This is not a flattering or particularly modern image, which is something the army realized themselves. Before the 2003 US invasion of Iraq, the operating military was repeatedly warned by both experts and Iraqi expats that an invasion could result in an insurgency by the Iraqi people. Military superiors decided to stick to their guns, as it were, and ignored this rather crucial advice. Chaos ensued and demonstrated how certain traditional attitudes were causing the military leaders to repeat the same avoidable mistakes. To shake things up, red teaming was institutionalized. Unfortunately, old habits die hard. Even in recent years, military leaders have still failed to make full use of their red teams. In 2010, for example, the head of the Marine Corps decided to make red teams an integral part of the force. This angered many Marine Corps officials, who thought they were doing just fine on their own. In 2011, a red team was deployed to support marine activity in Afghanistan. Unfortunately, the marine colonel leading the operation ignored red team findings and analysis. For example, the red team found that Afghan farmers would be better off transitioning from heavily-taxed opium crops to quinoa crops. However, the colonel insisted that wheat crops be grown, even though red team findings showed that quinoa could be grown far more effectively. Despite their expert knowledge, the red team’s efforts were ignored and they thus became redundant. This is, unfortunately, a common theme for red teams. And yet, they have the potential to be powerful tools in several forms of security. Find out more in the next blinks. Though we’d perhaps like to believe otherwise, the life of a spy isn’t all gadgets, glamor and car chases. The CIA is more about the best and brightest science nerds joining forces to collect intelligence on anybody or anything that may help officials make the right move. However, even intelligence groups make mistakes. The most significant intelligence output is the National Intelligence Estimate, which gathers data about specific countries or regions, and reveals corresponding trends. This data is highly confidential, accessible only to a handful of influential policymakers. But despite the crucial nature of this information, the National Intelligence Estimate has featured mistaken and misleading findings for decades. In 1949, for instance, the CIA issued an intelligence report stating with confidence that the soonest that Soviet forces could produce an atomic bomb would be in 1950. The reality was that Soviet researchers had been conducting nuclear tests long before the report was even published. In some ways, the CIA is like any other organization. It has a hierarchy, which often means that good intelligence slips through the cracks. After the 1998 terrorist attacks on US embassies in Tanzania and Kenya, for example, the CIA was certain that Osama bin Laden was the perpetrator. A group of powerful US officials secretly planned a military retaliation. They decided to bomb the Al Shifa chemical plant, even though several insiders advised against this. The officials ignored the insiders’ advice, and the bombing caused a diplomatic disaster. Contrary to CIA intelligence, the plant had no relation to bin Laden, nor did it have the capacity to produce nerve gas. In order to stop the upper rungs of a hierarchy from silencing accurate advice from less influential intelligence officers, the CIA requires an independent red team to highlight possible problems. Red teams can be of tremendous service to the public when highlighting security gaps and thus offering citizens better protection against terrorists; of course, this is only when they’re listened to. Long before 9/11, red teams had used their strategies to test the safety of air traffic. A 1996 operation saw a red team assess the security of Frankfurt’s International Airport, with frightening results. Out of 60 simulated attempts to smuggle a suitcase bomb onto a flight, none were unsuccessful. No airport staff detected what should have been a severe hazard. One of the red teamers even succeeded in obtaining a baggage handler’s uniform and ID and posted himself in the baggage transit line. An accomplice would then drop off a bag containing bomb equipment and notify the member when the bag was going through. These 1996 findings could have made a big difference to air safety – had they been acted upon. Ultimately, nothing was done. But there are certainly cases when a timely response to red team advice has led to great success. One of these is plane vulnerability to shoulder-held missiles. After an Israeli Boeing 757 was the target of two missiles launched by Al-Qaeda, the US Department of Homeland Security was determined to develop preventative measures. Red teams were deployed and, this time, found their audience to be far more receptive. The red team posited that a shoulder-held missile attack was likely to target planes from a specific country. Such an attack would also require exhaustive but undetectable surveillance of airport takeoff and landing patterns. The red team discovered that the most likely place to launch an attack on a plane at JFK International Airport would be from the cemeteries in the borough of Queens, which offered good vantage points for the airport runways. The Department of Homeland Security took this finding on board to eliminate vulnerabilities, making their efforts to hinder terrorists all the more effective. For some reason, companies seem to think that one aspect of their business they can skimp on is security. Sure, an investment in security might reduce immediate profits. But failing to tie up loose ends can prove disastrous. A 2008 episode of the reality show Tiger Team follows a red team as they demonstrate just how easy it is to rob a car dealership. By scoping out the office through an unsecured skylight, the team was able to find out which IT company supported the dealership. The red team then posed as tech support from the company, accessed the company server room and proceeded to delete the ID numbers for every car. The team finally posed as customers to discover that security cameras are positioned too high to capture a human crawling on the ground. After all this, the break-in itself was a cakewalk. A company’s online presence is often even easier to break into than its physical headquarters, though the results are often just as damaging. Discount retailer Target learned this the hard way in 2013, after hackers infiltrated their system to steal the credit card numbers of over 40 million customers. Savvy companies avoid catastrophes like this by recruiting white-hat hackers who are paid to test the susceptibility of their IT systems to intruders. These digital red teamers typically find it very easy to hack into the company’s system. If the company is smart enough to take the advice of red team hackers on board, they’re looking at a far safer future. Red teaming has a whole range of benefits for any organization. But it’s not all positives – red teaming has its own inevitable limitations, including a changing future. Find out more in the final blink. Do you enjoy getting recognition for your efforts, receiving praise and being patted on the back by others? Then don’t join a red team. Red teams don’t get to call the shots; they just advise the decision makers. If their advice is taken on board, it’s that decision maker who gets the credit for success, not the red team. This is nearly always the case, even in the capture of Osama bin Laden by American forces. Huge resources were deployed in order to determine whether bin Laden was hiding inside a well-secured Pakistani mansion. Three red teams examined the data and came up with 75, 60 and 40 percent probabilities, respectively, that bin Laden was inside. It was up to President Barack Obama to decide whether to take the risk despite these discordant estimates and storm the building. When the operation was a success, it was a credit to Obama, not the work of the red teams. Nevertheless, the future of red teaming is set to be interesting, particularly as human labor comes to be replaced by artificial intelligence in the coming decades. Even today, red teams make use of computer models and complex algorithms to uncover information that a rival doesn’t want to be known. White-hat hacker specialist Raphael Mudge has developed a range of computer programs to assist red teams in their attempts to probe the vulnerabilities of security systems. Armitage is one such program that allows red team members to work from a common server to share information instantly. Mudge is also working on a scripting language called Cortana, which makes it possible to build virtual robots to simulate the activity of red teamers within the Armitage program. These developments, among others, are sure to make red teaming incredibly effective in the future. The key message in this book: Far too many military and security mistakes have been made because of these institutions’ traditional, hierarchical decision-making structures. Red teams work to find the weak points of leadership decisions and security measures, thereby making them stronger.  Actionable advice: Use red teams to challenge the biggest, and only the biggest, decisions you have to make. The author recommends that the White House create a temporary red team that can be gathered before any critical decision is implemented. This team will not have been invested in the whole decision process and will therefore look at the problem with more objectivity, spotting potential pitfalls.

You’re only as slow as your broadband. But while the logistics of being the boss are undoubtedly easier in the modern world, that doesn’t automatically make us better leaders. In fact, in our rush to use technology we have lost the personal, human touch required to get the most from our employees. And if you want to inspire those employees as a real person rather than a management borg, you have to go further: the key to respect lies not in your job title, but in your dedication to your principles. These blinks are a guide to being an approachable, in-touch boss who gets things done. In these blinks you’ll learn why the best leaders get out of their offices and get their hands dirty; why you need to attract wannacomes to your meetings; and why Obama had to apologize to an art history professor. How often do you see the head of your department walking around the workplace? Rare occurrence? Department heads usually stay in their offices unless they have to come out to lead meetings. That means they don’t connect with their employees very much – they just keep in touch through periodic meetings and reports. But you’ll never truly understand your business and how it can be improved until you form strong connections with the people you work with. You need to get out of your office and interact with the people under you. In other words, you need to manage by walking around. The author did this when he first got his post as the president of Rhode Island School of Design (RISD). He wanted to know everything about the school, so he left the office and got to know the people in the departments around him. He brought them food and even helped the new students carry their luggage when they moved in, among other things. This style of personal management doesn’t mean taking over other people’s jobs, however. If you get too invested in working right alongside your employees, you might end up accidentally taking someone’s work from them, or making all the important decisions yourself, so your team members have nothing to do but the menial tasks. That will make them feel useless, as they won’t be contributing much to the team. Leaders need to lead, after all! A manager has to find the balance between working with their employees and giving them their space. Leaders have a variety of ways to communicate with their teams nowadays. If you can’t meet your team in person you can always connect with them on Skype or by email. We can communicate with more people over wider distances, but this also presents problems. As a leader, how do you ensure that your team members fully understand the messages you’re sending out? There are many strategies for clear communication, but the best is to use examples to back up your points. Facts are easier to understand when they’re presented with an example – it makes the information more real to your audience. Say you’re sending an email about the necessity of taking responsibility for one’s actions. You’ll need to explain what you mean and define your terms. As an example, you can point out that another employee will have to stay late if the others don’t do their work properly. That will help drive your point home. These skills are important but remember that it’s still always best to talk face to face. There’s no substitute for the warmth of personal communication. It’s not possible to meet in person with everyone all the time, however. So give your virtual messages a human touch when you can’t make it. The author once had to send an email to a campus at his college. He wanted to meet all the recipients in person but he knew that wasn’t possible, so he gave the email a nice personal touch: he attached a scan of a handwritten letter. The special touch worked. A lot more people responded to the email than usual – a bit of warmth made a big difference. Imagine your company has just created a product and they need to assemble a new team to manufacture, market and sell it. You’ve just been appointed leader. What’s the next step? The first step to making people feel like they’re part of a team is to get them all together in the same room. Teams don’t feel especially real when they’re first formed, but when the team members actually meet they’ll start feeling like they’re part of a group. After all, they’re united because they’re working toward the same goal. This meeting won’t be the last, of course. A team has to meet several times over the course of a project to discuss their strategy or work out any problems that arise. There are three types of people who come to meetings: wannacomes, havetacomes and wannaeats. Wannacomes do actually want to be there, havetacomes don’t, and the wannaeats are just there for the food. The best meetings are always those that are dominated by the wannacomes. If you want to make sure they’ll turn up, focus on keeping your meetings as snappy as possible. That means when you write up the agenda, you should only include the really important issues that need to be discussed. Wannacomes might not attend meeting about things they’re interested in if it means they’ll have to listen to pointless discussions about things they’re not interested in too. So keep your meetings brief. Short running times for meetings ensure that everyone stays on topic and keeps productive. And, more importantly, it’ll be more appealing for everyone who’s invited – the havetacomes and the wannaeats might just turn into wannacomes. Being a strong leader is about getting the job done – it’s not about morals or principles, right? Wrong. You don’t automatically become a leader because you have a great idea. You also need a solid method for pushing it forward into reality. The story of Jerome Wiesner, the former president of MIT, illustrates this. When he was younger, Wiesner served as a physicist for the Manhattan Project that developed the atomic bomb during the Second World War. After Wiesner saw the destruction of the war, he devoted his life to “fostering world peace and integrating the arts into the sciences at MIT.” Wiesner’s ideals turned him into a leader. He was so devoted to them that he started overseeing actions to realize them. He ended up becoming a leading voice in the global discussion on nuclear arms. So good ideas are important but they don’t make you a leader. Ideals do. And your principles shouldn’t just guide you at work – if you want to be a great leader, they must guide the rest of your life too. The author, for example, gets a number of benefits from being the leader of a college. He has a private car with a chauffeur, a mansion and membership in a private dining club. He doesn’t use any of these privileges, however. Why? Well, in a meeting during the financial crisis, he was once asked to imagine a parent struggling to pay for the child’s fees. He was asked how she might feel if she saw a faculty member getting those kinds of flashy benefits. The author has used this as a guideline for himself since then. He’s careful to think about how his image comes off. He knows that using his privileges as the president of RISD would go against what he believes in. Don’t forget that at the end of the day, leaders are just people. They’re influenced by their environment just like everyone else. So show your team members your human side! They’ll respect you if you live by your ideals. Leading by doing is always the most effective method. As you might imagine, a great leader needs a great team. So you need a team that supports you, but how do you earn their support? Great leaders always truly respect the people they’re working with. The best leaders usually go out of their way to show their staff that they appreciate them. Ikko Tanaka, one of Japan’s greatest designers, embraces this idea. He’s the mind behind several successful Japanese brands, including MUJI. He once invited the author to join him and his entire staff for dinner. When the author arrived, he was surprised to discover that Tanaka had prepared all the food himself. He also spoke about how thankful he was to have his staff because he knew they were the ones behind his success. He wanted to show his thanks and keep their respect. You can also keep your team’s respect by acknowledging and apologizing for any mistakes you make. It’s rare to find leaders that do this publicly. In fact, a high profile figure once apologized to the author for being hostile during a heated public meeting, but he asked him not to tell anyone about it. Don’t do this. Admit your mistakes publicly – it shows your humility. President Obama, for example, has apologized to the public several times. In February 2014, he even apologized for making a joke about art history majors. Ann Collins Johns, an art historian at Texas University, was so upset that Obama sent her a handwritten letter of apology, which she accepted. You can’t always be right, even when you’re a leader. If you admit to your mistakes, people will respect you a lot more. The key message in this book: When you become a leader, don’t forget that you’re a still a human being too. So live by your ideals, connect with your employees in personal ways and communicate as clearly as you can. Keep your meetings on point and remember that respect isn’t guaranteed – it’s earned. Only a great leader can inspire a great team. Actionable advice: Don’t take your team for granted. Give your team members freedom - they’ll perform better if they’re given space. So trust their creativity and don’t forget to show them your appreciation. Teams should be founded on respect.

But perhaps the struggles and obstacles Pao had to endure leading up to the trial are less well known. What was it like working at Kleiner? What were the challenges faced by Pao and other women working at the firm? And how did she come to pursue a lawsuit against one of the most powerful venture capital firms in the world? These blinks will give you an insight into the events leading up to and surrounding the case, as well as how Pao dealt with the blow of losing to Kleiner. In these blinks, you’ll learn: how deeply the “boys club” culture permeates the workplace; which highly popular social media site Pao was the former CEO of; and about an office romance that went astray. Ellen Pao grew up believing that a good education would inevitably lead to success, and so when she graduated from Harvard Law School in 1994, she saw endless career opportunities laid out in front of her. When she began working at the well-known New York City law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore as a corporate lawyer, however, she quickly realized things weren’t going to go quite how she’d expected. One of the things Pao noticed was that sexual discrimination had become so deeply rooted in the workplace that it often happened without anyone noticing it, sometimes not even the person on the receiving end. A coworker who was black and female was constantly mistaken for an administrative assistant or a paralegal, despite being dressed in suits donned only by attorneys. Furthermore, even though as a lawyer she had the authority to use company cars, Pao’s coworker faced difficulties in doing so. At the time, Pao’s coworker didn’t think too much about it, and thus never reported what happened. Ultimately, however, she was so distressed by these experiences that she ended up leaving the profession entirely. The case of Pao’s coworker serves as a reminder of how it’s nearly impossible to ascend the corporate ladder if you’re not one of “the boys,” despite your hardest efforts. Pao relates a time when the head of her department invited 12 male coworkers to dinner, following it up with a visit to a strip club. Pao pointed out that going to the strip club allowed the male coworkers an opportunity to get to know their boss on a more personal level, which is a massive advantage. These men-only events happened all the time. Pao managed to get a ticket to a hockey game once, but she was only allowed to come if she didn’t sit beside the senior partner. Such behaviors excluded women from important conversations and opportunities, and as a result, they had to double their efforts just to keep pace with their male counterparts. Pao finished her two-year MBA at Harvard Business School and in 2005 joined the influential venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers as chief of staff. Venture capital firms receive financial support from wealthy individuals, universities, families and pension funds, which they invest into startups, hoping for a return on investment. The venture capital industry is dominated by men, being a real “boys club”, and is predominantly white. On a business trip to New York, Pao shared a table with four white male colleagues, one of whom was a tech CEO and investor named Ted. The tech CEO expressed his desire to have a woman join his board, which consisted of only men, and Pao suggested that he invite one of Google’s founding partners, Marissa Mayer. Upon Pao’s suggestion, Ted said Mayer would be “too controversial,” while the rest of the men remarked that they would like her to join because she was hot. The men at the table then continued to openly discuss the type of sex worker they liked and bragged about meeting Jenna Jameson, a porn star, leaving Pao cringeing and uncomfortable. She was aware that the male colleagues didn’t like her being there. This feeling of exclusion was confirmed when they landed at Teterboro Airport, and the men organized a night out without extending an invitation to Pao. As a result, Pao missed out on the exchange of advice and information that occurs during these men-only events. A sad reality of the business world is that men are praised for having ambition and being forward-thinking; however, when women show those qualities, they’re often ignored. During the early days of Twitter, Pao saw promise and potential in the platform’s ability to connect people all over the world, and so she decided to get in touch with their CEO, Jack Dorsey. She then pitched Twitter to a partner at Kleiner, but he showed no interest and dismissed her proposal. Almost four years later, Kleiner would finally invest in Twitter, upon the suggestion of a male junior partner, of course. By that point, Twitter’s value had gone up by 400 percent, but the male partner was celebrated as a genius nonetheless, while Pao’s foresight was completely disregarded. Though she was aware of the inequality rampant in the world of venture capital, Pao decided to stay at Kleiner because she enjoyed the work. But even following her promotion to junior partner in 2007, her male coworkers still didn’t take her seriously nor did they listen to her opinions. One incident that comes to mind is the pitch of an Indian classifieds website to their fund’s investors. During preparation for the pitch, a colleague of Pao’s suggested that she “search for turbans!” When she refused to do so, her colleagues branded her a “killjoy.” Furthermore, when Pao brought this incident up with her managing partner, he simply told her she was overreacting and making a big fuss about nothing. The managing partner repeated the same distasteful joke at a fundraising meeting and had to apologize immediately when he saw that one of the investors was an Indian woman. This insensitive behavior toward women in the workplace is perpetuated by the “boys club” dogma of protecting its own members. While on a business trip, Pao’s coworker Ajit Nazre told her that he believed they would make a good couple, even though he was a married man at the time. After he told Pao that he’d separated from his wife, the two began dating. He would give her the inside scoop on who had left the company and share Kleiner’s various philosophies and beliefs on investment. During this time, Pao felt like she’d finally been accepted and seen as an equal at the firm. However, it turned out that Nazre had lied to Pao about divorcing his wife, and so when Pao learned the truth, she stopped seeing him romantically. The problem was that she still had to face him at work. It became evident that since the break up, Nazre was intentionally misleading Pao and excluding her from important email threads and meetings. Pao alerted her managing partner, Ray Lane, to Nazre’s misconduct, but her concerns fell on deaf ears. Lane had gotten to know Nazre from the male-only dinners and events, and they bonded over conversations about women. Due to Lane’s fondness for Nazre, the managing partner defended him in the face of Pao’s complaints. Having been promoted to senior partner, Nazre was now in a higher and more powerful rank than Pao. He gained the authority to impede her career aspirations by writing negative performance reviews about her. In an attempt to do something about this abuse of power, Pao filed a number of verbal and written reports, but, after a while, the HR consultant at Kleiner told her to stop complaining. Additionally, Pao confided in her fellow junior partner, Trae Vassallo, about her unfair treatment, hoping to build her case. Much to her surprise, however, Vassallo admitted that Nazre had sexually harassed her. Nazre had asked Vassallo to join him on a business trip to New York – which turned out not to be a business trip at all. Nazre had lied, again, and showed up at her hotel room wearing nothing but a bathrobe, unsuccessfully insisting that she let him in. With this story up her sleeve, Pao relayed Nazre’s series of misdemeanors to the managing partners at Kleiner. He finally left the firm after negotiating the conditions of his severance package for two months. Though she had won this small battle, Pao wasn’t satisfied. She wanted to see real, long-lasting change and to eradicate the “boys club” culture at Kleiner. Furthering her efforts, Pao convinced the firm to hire an independent investigator, but Kleiner seemed less than interested in her and Vassallo’s experiences of harassment in the workplace. This disinterest became apparent when Kleiner failed to introduce anti-discrimination and anti-sexual harassment training in the workplace. Unsatisfied with these results, Pao contacted the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing and filed a lawsuit against her company for their inaction, the inadequate investigation efforts and the unfair treatment and exclusion of women in the workplace. She was advised by her lawyer to continue working at Kleiner, as this would strengthen her case. But she only lasted a few months before being fired on the claim that she had performed poorly in her latest review. Pao vs. Kleiner escalated when the company’s lead defense lawyer started to publicly shame Pao, using private information from her therapy sessions and from conversations between herself, her husband and her lawyers. Public shaming, Pao discovered upon becoming Reddit’s CEO, is found all over the internet. Back then, Reddit was a small startup that called itself “the front page of the internet.” Reddit users could share news and photos that would be either upvoted or downvoted in real time. It was through Reddit that Pao familiarized herself with the dark side of the web. Journalist Eron Gjoni created a blog in August 2014 called “The Zoe Post,” where he wrote about his ex-girlfriend Zöe Quinn’s infidelity. Via the internet, he rallied supporters whom he would encourage to continue publicly shaming her on other platforms, such as 4chan, 8chan, Internet Relay Chat, and of course, Reddit. His supporters published her personal information online, hacked into her account, sent her death and rape threats and made computer games depicting violent acts against her. This type of online behavior was unacceptable to Pao, and, in 2015, she banned revenge porn and unsolicited nudes on Reddit. Her actions encouraged many well-known websites, like Facebook, to take the same zero-tolerance attitude. Emboldened to do more, Pao employed Reddit and the internet as her weapons to take down discrimination and harassment. To help her with her ambitious task, Pao sought the advice of investor and entrepreneur Susan Wu. Wu became an activist after hearing about the case of a woman raped by Stanford University swimmer Brock Turner. Wu created the hashtag #IWasRapedToo in an attempt to encourage more women to speak up about their experiences. Meanwhile, online press coverage began picking up Pao’s lawsuit against her former company, and many women reached out to her. It was clear that sexual discrimination was happening everywhere. Reporters began to call this sudden flood of women speaking up about their experiences the Pao Effect. Pao was convinced that she had enough evidence to win the case against her former employer, but the firm had the financial capabilities and the human resources to build a strong defense based on hundreds and thousands of emails. During her trial, Pao was also busy with two full-time jobs: being the CEO of Reddit and a mother. On 27 March 2015, the final verdict was in: Pao had lost the case. Nevertheless, the support she received throughout the trial was of immense importance. Though she had lost, Pao never once felt she was alone in her battle. She was forever grateful for the support of her family and friends, who stuck with her right to the end. She also received a lot of unexpected support from women all around the world. Her inbox on LinkedIn alone was flooded with hundreds of supportive messages. Pao hadn’t won the case, but she’d won the hearts and minds of many women across all industries, including the tech industry. With this overwhelming support, Pao decided to gather other women in executive positions to brainstorm how they could reset the tech industry. Pao’s initiative resulted in the founding of Project Include, with a mission to provide CEOs and venture capital firms with the tools and solutions they needed to effectively fight against workplace discrimination. The co-founders are influential women who all share similar experiences, like former Google engineer, Erica Joy Baker, diversity advocate Brianna Wu and Pinterest engineer Tracy Chou. These women developed the project’s three core solutions to combat discrimination at work: inclusion of all employees, comprehensiveness and accountability. Project Include gives CEOs useful advice on how to diversify their teams and lead them to success. Since its founding, the project has become an award-winning non-profit organization, spreading the word for more inclusivity in the workplace. The key message in this book: No matter your race, gender, age, sexuality, disability or if you’re pregnant, everyone is entitled to equal career opportunities. This means fair allocation of jobs, a workplace that doesn’t tolerate discrimination or harassment, and the assurance that every employee is paid according to their performance. Pao’s journey shows us that we shouldn’t be discouraged after one knockback, and that speaking up against these injustices can have wide-reaching effects. Actionable advice: Introduce and enforce zero-tolerance discrimination and harassment policies. To help end misconduct in the workplace, the first thing companies need to do is clearly communicate to their employees which behaviors are appropriate and which are not. This means equal opportunities based on performance, plus devising and implementing anti-discrimination and anti-harassment policies that provide clear-cut reporting processes. There should be zero tolerance for violations regardless of company rank. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Finding the ideal price for your product is often a struggle. Most take the easy way out, looking simply at what it costs to make a product, and doubling that sum. But by not taking a serious look at your company’s pricing strategy, you’re potentially missing serious profit opportunities. Consider this: A study showed that a 1 percent price increase can generate an 11 percent growth in operating profits! This is the secret behind “The 1 Percent Windfall,” a strategy that will help you price your company’s product to its best advantage. These blinks pull from real-life examples to show you exactly how strategic pricing can transform your profits, crush the competition and help your company grab a broader market share. In these blinks, you’ll discover why Disney World is comfortable with customers tiring of its services after three days; what exactly is Morton’s greatest beef steak trick; and what pricing strategies from Ralph Lauren and American Express have in common. How do you determine your product’s price? If profit is your priority, the best way to do this is through value pricing. Value pricing uses the customer’s next-best alternative as a base price and adds or subtracts cost, depending on the product’s attributes. There are two ways to calculate this: one-on-one pricing and multi-customer pricing. Which pricing strategy should you use, and when? To set a one-on-one price, first identify your target customer. Then identify your customer’s next-best alternative product, and the difference between your product and the other product. Based on this calculation, you can then determine your product’s value. One-on-one pricing is your best option when a product or service is sold to a single customer, such as selling a home. One-on-one pricing is also the most viable option when pricing a new product.   Say that you and your neighbor are renting your homes. The only difference between the two homes is that your house has a pool. In this situation, there are three possible outcomes: In the first outcome, the rental price your neighbor has set, $1,000, is reasonable. You know that people are willing to pay 20 percent more for a pool, so you then set your price at $1,200.   In the second outcome, your neighbor’s rental price, $2,000, is too high. But you can’t charge above a reasonable market price just because competitors are doing so. Knowing that a reasonable price is $1,000, you add the value of the pool to come up with a price of $1,200. In the third outcome, your neighbor has set a too-low rental price: $500. You’ll have to accept this low price as a base. But since people can rent your house at such a discount, they’ll be willing to pay more for a pool, say 30 percent more. With this calculation, your price is then $650. Our next step is understanding how to sell to many customers: Read on for more! While one-on-one pricing works in specific circumstances, companies that produce products on a large scale for many customers need to employ a different strategy. Multi-customer pricing is the most effective strategy to set prices for a broader customer base. Setting a value-based price means finding the optimum trade-off between margin and quantity sold. In general, a high price brings higher margins, but you’ll sell less; a low price brings lower margins, but you’ll sell more. With these two things in mind, let’s set a multi-customer price. To start, follow the initial steps for one-on-one pricing. Identify your target customer, their next best product alternative, and then differentiate your product from that other product. Here’s where things are different. Now, you’ll need to create a demand curve and perform a comparative analysis to determine the most profitable price for your product. A demand curve is the correlation between a product’s price and the corresponding number of customers willing to buy it at each price. Where do you get such information? This is where market research comes in. Company XYZ, for example, identified that the highest and lowest possible prices for its  product were $5 and $1. Research showed that among 100 customers, 20 customers would buy at $5; 40 would buy at $4; 60 at $3; 80 at $2; and 100 at $1. With this, determine the most profitable price for your product by calculating revenues, costs and profits at different prices and production levels. Let’s say Company XYZ’s production cost is $2 per unit. The company will lose $100 if it sets its price at $1, and will break-even if the price is set at $2. What price would you set, and how many units would you make? According to market research, the optimum profit is achieved when Company XYZ makes 40 units, which would costs $80, and then sells a unit at $4. This would bring in $80 of profit! Often your prospect will be close to buying, only to say “no” due to financial concerns. To avoid this, consider pricing strategies that will turn the “no” into a “yes.” If convincing your customer of the value of your product is the problem, consider offering a success fee plan, which has a lower base price but offers additional payments in the case when key success metrics are achieved. For example, when the Boston Red Sox signed star pitcher Curt Schilling, the team offered a base salary of $8 million, with an extra $2 million if Schilling stayed in shape and $4 million more if he pitched the whole season without interruption. What about price fluctuations? You can attract a customer by offering a peace-of-mind guarantee, which sets a fixed price for a product for a specific period. High-end steakhouse chain Morton’s has such a plan. The chain needs to have a steady supply of high-quality meat, and even a 5-10 percent unexpected price fluctuation in the market can easily destroy company profits. And if its supply chain is somehow interrupted, market share – not to mention reputation – can be seriously damaged. So to secure both prices and supply, Morton’s bought peace-of-mind guarantee contracts to ensure that 70 percent of the beef it purchases is locked into a certain price, no matter what the market conditions. Sometimes customers want to buy a product but can’t afford a big, one-time payment. Financing plans allow customers to spread payments over time. Electronics company Best Buy offers a two-year financing plan without interest for customers who spend over $999. And since a minimum purchase was set, many customers actually added items to their cart to hit the minimum – which in turn raised Best Buy’s sales volumes above Amazon’s. And importantly, the company was able to reach out to the low-end market without actually lowering prices. We all have our own comfort zones when it comes to prices, which explains why a jacket that’s too pricey for you is a bargain for your fashion-minded friend! Differential pricing helps bring in higher profits from those customers willing to pay more, while at the same time winning new customers who’d prefer to pay a bit less. New York’s Omni Berkshire Hotel puts differential pricing in action by varying the price of its hotel suites in different listings. On Priceline.com, the hotel lists suites with prices starting at $136 per night. But with hotel agent NY City Luxury Hotel, the very same suites are listed from $231 to $257, including the option to cancel without penalty. In this way, the hotel can attract a wider range of customers, depending on budget and need. But how do you differentiate between customers? Differential pricing tactics are largely based on customer characteristics and selling characteristics. The price of insurance plans is affected by customer characteristics. All U.S. insurance companies offer data to the Comprehensive Loss Underwriting Exchange database. Companies can track a prospect’s previous claims, to then offer an adequate insurance premium. What about selling characteristics? Remember that the more units of a product a customer consumes, the lower the next unit is valued. At Disney World, customers relish the first day’s visit. A second day is equally exciting. The third, however, is tiring; a fifth and the thrill is gone. Disney incorporated this diminishing valuation of selling characteristics into the pricing of a five-day pass. A single-day pass costs $75; a second day costs $74; and a third costs $63. Yet a fourth day costs just $7 and a fifth day $3. The idea to offer a fourth and fifth day for a hugely discounted price – instead, for example, of just offering a three-day pass – is that it brings Disney not only that extra $10 but also the additional revenues from food and souvenirs purchased on those extra days. It’s hard to resist spending a few extra dollars for a premium package. But how exactly do companies convince us to do so? The truth is that just a few minor modifications of a product can attract tons of new customers. We call this tactic versioning – different versions of a product are created to meet basic, premium and unique customer needs. Take American Express. The credit card company offers three different cards, each with unique benefits. The basic option is its “green” card, at $95 per year. A “platinum” card costs $450 per year but comes with additional premium benefits. And the “black” card, with a price tag of $5,000 per year, meets the needs of those looking for a more exclusive option. Simply by enhancing a product’s features to make it faster, better or more accessible allows companies to both attract new customers and encourage existing ones to upgrade. For example, in 1994 Ralph Lauren created its Purple Label menswear line, using only the finest quality cloth for its existing fashion designs. While a “regular” shirt from Ralph Lauren costs $79.50, a Purple Label shirt was priced at up to $365. By creating a high-end version of its existing product, Ralph Lauren was able to compete in another market segment, with exclusive brands like Gucci and Armani. While adding special features can attract high-end clients, stripping your product to its basic functions can draw in even the most price-sensitive customers. The Los Angeles Lakers, for example, sell tickets to its basketball games ranging from $2,500 to sit courtside to $10 to watch the game near the top of the vast arena. Economic recessions are something every business must cope with. What’s your plan of action? As demand for your products drops, lowering prices seems like a logical move. This is a double-edged sword, however: just think of how difficult it may be to raise your prices again. To avoid this dilemma, arm yourself with a well-structured pricing strategy, as this will keep your organization afloat no matter what the world throws at it. Instead of lowering prices on products that ought to cost more, a more effective recession strategy is the introduction of a fighter brand. This is a line specifically designed for times of crisis, to meet demand for low-priced products that have basic functions. Guitar maker C.F. Martin & Co. suffered from a 20 percent sales drop during the 2008 recession. Though its most-popular models cost $2,000 to $3,000, these prices were simply too steep to attract new customers. So CEO Chris Martin introduced a new, basic model that cost less than $1,000. The new budget guitar proved incredibly popular, and over 8,000 were sold within the first year. This strategy boosted the company in three ways. While high-end customers continued purchasing more expensive models, price-sensitive clients had a budget option. And after the recession, the company withdrew its budget model, enticing its newly expanded customer base to upgrade to its line of higher-end guitars. But what if recession isn’t the issue, but a period of inflation? There are pricing strategies for this too. One strategy companies use to accommodate inflation is to reduce quantity yet keep prices stable. For example, in 2008, prices were rising and companies had to react. Unilever decided to reduce the size of its Breyers Ice Cream containers, from 56 ounces to 48 ounces. This way, it could accommodate rising material costs without charging more, all with one subtle, almost unnoticeable change. The key message in this book: No matter how big your market, elusive your prospects or deep the market recession, there are always strategies to help you get the most profit out of your products. Think ahead and plan for every market eventuality so your pricing strategies keep you growing even in the worst of times!

Unfortunately, these unconscious leaders are quite common. Although this kind of leadership can be effective, producing good results in the short run, it never leads to true growth over time – neither on a business nor a personal level.

Many leaders consider themselves successful, even if their workplace has a stressful atmosphere or they don't have strong relationships in their personal lives. Success, however, doesn't have to come at the price of true contentment – you can find success and personal happiness if you lead a conscious life. A person can live – and lead – in one of two ways: consciously or unconsciously. Unconscious leaders don't respond well to changes in their environment. They cling to old models and patterns, even when it's counterproductive – that's why they always view themselves as victims of circumstance. They think their success and personal happiness is produced by outside factors. Conscious leaders, on the other hand, are much better at living in the moment. They learn from whatever situation they're in and know they have the power to change it. Don't think of conscious leading as a stage you reach. It's really a state of mind – and you can deliberately enter it at any time. How? By always staying honest with yourself and the position you're in. Living unconsciously might sound unpleasant, but it's actually the norm for most people. If you're happy, there’s nothing wrong with unconscious living; however, if you want to be a leader who fosters creative energy in the workplace and builds strong relationships, you have to be honest with yourself about where you stand. After all, you have to make a conscious effort to lead a life of conscious leadership. You can aim to be a conscious leader by using the 15 Commitments of Conscious Leadership. Contrary to popular belief, commitments are not promises for the future. They're statements about your present reality. When you can determine the things you're committed to, you can assess whether you're a conscious or unconscious leader. The first two of the 15 commitments are the core of conscious leadership. The first commitment is about taking full responsibility for every aspect of your life. When things don't turn out as planned, unconscious leaders try to place the blame on something or someone else. To avoid acting in this way, hold yourself accountable for everything you do. If quarterly numbers are lower than projected, for example, an unconscious CEO would look for where to place the blame. And, depending on their personality, they'd see themselves as either the victim or the hero or the villain of the situation. Victims attribute their problems to the world's injustices; villains point the finger at someone or something else; and heroes try to take on more than their share of the responsibility. All three are equally detrimental to the group: victims don't have the drive to change anything, villains lose control of the situation and heroes overwork themselves until they burn out. Conscious leaders, however, are committed to taking full responsibility for themselves – neither more nor less. They understand that their actions have consequences, so they don't hasten to blame someone else. The second commitment of conscious leadership is to learn by staying curious, rather than aiming to prove a point. Unconscious leaders don't seize the opportunity to learn from their mistakes when things go wrong. Instead, they get defensive and stubbornly insist that they're right – even if it's obvious they aren't. Conscious leaders know that each experience – good or bad – is a learning opportunity. They're realistic about their own views; they know they aren't always right, and they're eager to learn new things. Instead of looking for something to blame, they look for a lesson to learn. Conscious leaders are adept learners. They are students of both themselves and their environment. They also know how to learn through themselves, by exploring their own feelings. That's why the third commitment of conscious leaders is to not resist or recycle any emotions. There's little room for emotions in the workplace. People are taught to think with their heads only. That's even truer of leaders: unconscious leaders think feelings and emotions distract from work, so they try to repress them. We repress our feelings in a lot of ways, and we all know how it feels. Just think about the last time you felt uncomfortable about something at work but didn't say anything about it. Another way unconscious leaders resist dealing with their feelings is by recycling them: getting stuck in a cycle where they feed their emotions with thoughts that support them, like a jealous person looking for evidence that their partner is cheating on them. This gets you stuck in a self-perpetuating cycle of bad feelings that you never actually address. Conscious leaders, on the other hand, are committed to having high emotional intelligence. They know that feelings are a source of wisdom. Anger, for instance, is a sign that something isn't harmonious – some part of the whole needs to be fixed. Sadness is your body's way of telling you to let something go. Joy is a sign that things are going well, that you need to celebrate! That's why conscious leaders don't turn away from their emotions. They know that emotions are powerful tools for learning or bringing others together to overcome challenges. They accept and enjoy their emotions for what they are. The next two commitments of conscious leadership are all about communication. The fourth commitment is to always speak and listen carefully. It's important to keep a realistic perspective, and it's impossible to do that alone. You have to consider other points of view if you want to get a well-rounded picture, and that means listening to what others say. It’s important to keep in mind, though, that people often withhold information, not out of malice, but because of things like fear or shame. This is dangerous, because when you withhold your feelings, you run the risk of judging others for the problems you're uncomfortable addressing with them. For example, if you're upset with a friend because they cancelled an appointment, and you don't tell them, you'll probably just pull back and expect them to apologize. And when you withdraw like that, you'll view your friend through your own judgmental lens. You'll see them as a person who disrespected you, and think they're disrespectful in general. Listening consciously is equally important. Leaders usually don't fully listen to others; they filter their words through their thoughts, adding their own meaning to them. For example, if an employee says they have a problem with a colleague and their unconscious leader has an avoid-conflict filter, the leader will be looking for clues that the employee has good intentions. Conversely, conscious leaders listen to what the other person is really saying. The fifth commitment of conscious leadership is to avoid gossip. It's important to be truthful, but it's equally important to make sure you're sharing the truth at the appropriate times and with the appropriate people. Gossip is widespread in office culture, and though it's widely accepted, it's very toxic. It prevents employees from building trust and hinders their creative energy. Gossip is harmful for everyone involved – the person gossiping, the person listening and the person being gossiped about. Everyone in the workplace should aim to reduce gossip. Don't be afraid to discuss the issue openly with your employees. The sixth commitment of conscious leadership – living a life of integrity – is closely intertwined with the others. Integrity is important to leaders, because leaders, when they slip up, demoralize their team. If a leader is dishonest or unreliable, it poisons the company as a whole. A person has integrity when they're fully whole. That means they take complete responsibility for their actions, speak honestly and express their feelings openly. The final part of integrity is keeping your word. Breaking even the smallest promise – like not buying juice when you said you would – can seriously disturb the group's energy flow. So when you're making a promise or dealing with someone, be clear about your terms so that they know what to expect. Make sure you keep up with any arrangement you've made at least 90 percent of the time – and negotiate in the times when you absolutely can't. And if you ever do have to go back on your word, make it up to the person by asking if there's anything you can do. The seventh commitment of conscious leadership is to be more appreciative. When you show your appreciation for your employees, for example, you help them gain appreciation for themselves and, in turn, each other. It allows you to see them in a new light, because you'll always be reminding yourself of why you value them in the first place. Appreciating others is kind of like wine tasting: an experienced wine enthusiast is much better at distinguishing between subtle tastes. Likewise, an experienced appreciator is much better at discerning people’s uniqueness, and giving them credit for it! A person who never thinks about wine can't tell the difference between a Chardonnay and a Pinot Noir. So think about what makes your employees special. It’ll only help you see (or taste!) more. The eighth commitment of conscious leadership is to express your own brilliance as much as you can – and still have fun! Most people work and operate in one of three zones: the zone of incompetence, the zone of competence or the zone of excellence. You're in the zone of incompetence when you're doing something you're not good at and don't enjoy. In the zone of competence, you're good at what you do, but it isn't truly fulfilling. When you can perform a task extremely well but you don't really enjoy it, you're in the zone of excellence. You might produce fantastic work, but you aren't being creative anymore. We tend to stay in these zones because we subconsciously limit ourselves. Have you ever given up on something because you thought you'd never be good enough? Feelings like that are what keep you down. If you want to be a conscious leader, you need to spend as much time as possible in the zone of your genius. That means doing what you love and are good at – tasks you love so much they don't even feel like work! This dovetails nicely with the ninth commitment of conscious leadership, which is to play instead of struggle. Since conscious leaders spend so much time in their zone of genius, they naturally work in a more playful and fun manner. That doesn't mean that they don't work hard; they're just committed to working in a way that’s more creative and laid-back. There are always ways to combine work and play. That's why Dan Cawley, the CFO of Hopelab Inc., once presented the quarterly financials while impersonating his mother's Irish accent! Doing so not only added an element of fun; he got people to pay attention, too! The next three commitments are the secret to how conscious leaders find their inner peace and happiness. The tenth commitment is to be open to interpretations other than your own. Most of the pain in our lives comes from our wanting to change a situation that we perceive as bad. But conscious leaders know that experiences are never purely good or bad – those are just the labels we assign them. That's why conscious leaders strive to explore alternative interpretations of their thoughts and surroundings. Jim Barnett, the founder of Turn Inc., struggled with this when he reached a point at which he no longer wanted to work in business, but felt that leaving his position as CEO would be irresponsible. The authors helped him realize that leaving his position would, in fact, be a very responsible decision, as it would allow the position to go to someone with more passion for it. The eleventh commitment of conscious leadership is to find internal security, control and approval, rather than seeking it from the outside world. Nearly every dream, goal or desire you've ever had was essentially about wanting approval, control or security. It's natural to want those things, but it's unhealthy to endlessly chase them. Conscious leaders know how to appreciate the approval, control and security they already have. The twelfth commitment of conscious leadership is to recognize that you already have enough of everything. And it's not only your material things that are abundant – realize that you've also got plenty of time, money and love. Most people assume that all resources are scarce. Conscious leaders, however, appreciate what they have, and that allows them to live in the moment. The final three commitments of conscious leadership are about communication – both with individuals and the world as a whole. The thirteenth commitment of conscious leadership is to view everyone and everything as a potential tool for personal growth. Unconscious leaders tell themselves that other people or circumstances prevent them from reaching their goals. Conscious leaders, on the other hand, know that virtually everything they encounter in life helps them grow in some way. For example, an unconscious leader might view a strike as nothing more than an obstacle to meeting his numbers, but a conscious leader would see it as a chance to improve her work environment. The fourteenth commitment of conscious leadership is to create situations where everyone wins. Unconscious leaders assume that competition and compromise are the only ways to solve problems; conscious leaders know that this isn't true. Consider what the authors did when they wanted to become more invested in The Conscious Leadership Group, but their colleague Kaley wanted to spend more time at home with her newborn daughter. Instead of just compromising on the situation, they talked through it carefully and found a new solution that worked well for everyone: ending the partnership on a high note. That's why the final commitment of conscious leaders is to become the solution to the problems in the world. Since conscious leaders see things in terms of abundance, they don't view problems in the world as the result of a lack of something. When something is missing, they just see that as more potential space for other things. They can choose to become the solution to the problems they see. The key message in this book: Conscious leadership is the key to living a fulfilling life, both in your professional life and at home. So never stop learning – about yourself, your environment and the people around you. Stay open to new ideas, take responsibility for yourself and appreciate what you have. Becoming a conscious leader benefits everyone – you, the people around you and the world as a whole. Actionable advice: Trick your brain into always staying happy. Whenever you experience something great – like getting a promotion or going on a fun date – do something ordinary afterwards, like the dishes! You'll trick yourself into thinking that happiness and success are normal, and be happier as a result.

Maxwell","summary":"Do you consider yourself a born leader? Few people do – and for good reason. Even if you’re a naturally imposing person and have headed up every single group you’ve been in since entering kindergarten, this only means that you’re more dominant than others. Fact is, no one is born a leader. Leadership is a skill and it’s completely up to you to develop it. It’s all about getting others to follow you – and these blinks will show you how. They lay out the most important of the 21 laws of leadership, from which you’ll glean the traits and skills that will boost your ability to lead, even if you focus on just a few of them. And you’ll also find out how an employer’s age affects whether he’ll hire you or not; why Ray Kroc, and not the McDonald brothers, turned McDonald’s into a global player; and how a woman who escaped slavery became a heroic leader. There’s a McDonald’s on just about every corner these days. But do you know how this behemoth got started? It began in 1937, in Pasadena, California, when brothers Dick and Maurice McDonald opened a small drive-in restaurant that actually specialized in hot dogs, not hamburgers. A few years later, they relocated to San Bernardino, California, where they reorganized their kitchen into a fast-moving assembly line and included hamburgers on the menu. In 1952, the brothers decided to franchise their fast-food concept, but immediately ran into problems.   This was due to the Law of the Lid, one of the 21 irrefutable laws of leadership. It states that the potential success of you and your company is limited by one single quality: your ability to lead. And that’s why the brothers had trouble franchising their business. Despite being great with customers and having innovative ideas, they were horribly inept leaders, which meant that very few franchisees were willing to put their faith in the concept. This became even more apparent after they struck a deal with Ray Kroc to expand the business. A great leader in his own right, Kroc got to work fixing the apparent problems by recruiting other leaders for all the critical positions. And even though he couldn’t really afford to pay them, he took out personal bank loans, cashed out his life insurance policy and sacrificed his own salary for years in order to get things running smoothly. The results speak for themselves. While the McDonald brothers only made 15 franchise deals on their own, Ray Kroc closed 100 in his first four years with the company and nearly 400 additional ones in the four years that followed. The vast importance of the leader also means that when an organization is hurting, it’s typically the leader who’s going to take the fall. For instance, when the consultants at the advisory firm Global Hospitality Resources are called in to rescue a struggling hotel, one of their first solutions is to fire the boss. For them, it’s obvious that, if the hotel had a good leader, it wouldn’t be asking for help in the first place. The Law of the Lid shows us that leaders are in a vulnerable position if they don’t perform well. So how can you ensure that this doesn’t happen to you? Enter the next law – the Law of Influence. If you want to hire someone who has shown previous leadership ability, you need to look for signs of the most important skill: the ability to influence others. Instead of just checking for appropriate job titles on a resume, look for followers. If someone is a true leader, they should have a long line of people that they’ve influenced. Take Mother Teresa: She might have appeared small and frail, but she was an amazing leader who created a personal army of followers to help further her mission of feeding and assisting the poor. And whenever she spoke, people would stop and listen because they respected her impressive ability to lead. These thousands of followers and volunteers formed her worldwide organization, the Missionaries of Charity. She even continued to gain followers during a time when most Catholic churches were struggling to hold on to their members. So how can you learn to influence people? You need to show intuition and pay attention to the intangible factors that can affect your followers. For example, you should be able to spot when someone is feeling as if they’re being treated unfairly. With intuition you can sense rising tensions and resolve issues before they really start hurting your business. Another helpful method for boosting morale and convincing people to follow your lead is to highlight past successes. It will be easier to get people motivated and confident that they’re heading in the right direction if they can see evidence of past successes rather than a trail of disappointments. To see what happens when leadership comes crumbling down, let’s take a quick look at the Watergate scandal. In the early 1970s, members of President Nixon’s administration were found guilty of illegal activities, including a burglary at the offices of the Democratic National Committee. As a result, Nixon lost the trust of the American people and was forced to resign. This brings us to the Law of Solid Ground, which states that leaders must work on a solid foundation of trust. After all, people won’t follow just anyone; they need someone they can put their trust in, someone who is reliable and treats his followers with honesty, fairness and good judgment. One common way of losing trust is to take shortcuts instead of following the proper procedures. Most organizations have guidelines on how things should be done, whether it’s giving someone a promotion or firing an employee. If a leader doesn’t follow these rules, he can come across as disrespectful. Leaders are supposed to be the ones who enforce the rules and hold others accountable for following them; therefore, if you suddenly decide to take shortcuts, you can end up losing the trust of your entire organization by giving the impression that you’re above the rules. This is what led to Nixon’s downfall: by approving of something illegal, he gave the impression that the rules didn’t apply to him. The author gives a personal example as well. He was working as a senior pastor for the Skyline Church in San Diego, and during an especially hectic holiday season, he realized that it was necessary to let a staff member go immediately. The author made this decision on his own without talking it over beforehand with the community, and even though his intentions were good, his shortcut unsettled the church congregation, and he had to work hard to earn back their trust. Influence and trust are two important qualities for any leader, but it’s also crucial that a leader enjoys the respect of her followers. The Law of Respect goes into effect when people encounter someone with strength, a leader who’s more skilled, determined and courageous than they are – the exact kind of qualities that followers look for in a leader. Harriet Tubman is a great example of a respected leader. Born a slave in 1820, she eventually escaped to the free state of Pennsylvania, where she began helping other slaves safely escape by becoming a leader in the Underground Railroad. Tubman, with her impressively strong-will, was respected by everyone she worked with, especially the fugitive slaves she helped free by leading them on dangerous journeys to the North. The risks that Tubman was willing to take played a big part in how she earned others’ respect. Every time she traveled to the South to embark on another mission, she displayed courage and determination. Failure and death threatened at every turn. Each time she freed more slaves, Southerners raised the bounty on her head. But these threats didn’t deter Tubman, and respect for her only grew as she courageously continued to go on a total of at least 19 missions. It’s clear that Tubman was loyal to her cause, and this is also a powerful driver of respect. As a leader, you can show your loyalty by being devoted to the welfare and goals of your followers. This is a valuable quality, since, these days, loyalty can be hard to find. CEOs, professional athletes and coaches often go wherever the money is. Such shifting loyalties, however, can lead to their losing the respect of their followers. On the other hand, leaders earn respect by hanging in there when the organization is struggling. That’s why great athletes and coaches stick with their team even through a losing streak, and true business leaders will fight to save the jobs of their followers when the company hits a rough patch. Now that you have your leadership qualities in place, it’s time to make sure you have a good team. First, imagine your ideal team. What kind of people do you see? There’s a good chance you see a group of people that are similar to you, in everything from age and background to personality and ambition. This is known as the Law of Magnetism. So, if you’re 35, you are more likely to hire someone who’s also in their thirties, instead of someone who’s 16 or 65 years old. We saw this law in action during the dot-com explosion of the 1990s, when thousands of businesses were founded and then staffed by entrepreneurial folks who were all in their twenties or thirties. But it’s not just age; it’s personality as well. If you’re a tidy perfectionist, chances are you won’t want to hire someone who comes in all disheveled and makes a mess of your office, no matter how brilliant that person’s résumé. Instead, you’d probably pick someone who’s meticulous and detail-oriented, just like you. Even Theodore Roosevelt followed the Law of Magnetism when he was recruiting people to fight in his infantry during the Spanish-American War. Roosevelt grew up in a wealthy aristocratic family from the Northeast before moving west to the Dakotas and living the life of a cowboy and hunter. So, during the war, Teddy recruited people who came from similar backgrounds, resulting in a militia of Northeast aristocrats and Western cowboys. Therefore, keep in mind: a leader’s own traits can shape a team, or even an entire organization. Back at the Skyline Church, the author’s predecessor was Dr. Orval Butcher, a great leader and also a fantastic musician. When he put together a new staff for the church, Butcher gathered people like himself, and the church went on to be widely known for its terrific music. Are you a poor loser? If so, don’t feel too bad, because if you want to be a leader, you need to be a terrible loser. For great leaders, losing and giving up the fight are not valid options; this is called the Law of Victory. Winston Churchill is a perfect example of this kind of leadership. During World War II, he refused to accept defeat even when Nazi Germany controlled most of Europe and bombed England. Even when all seemed lost he continued searching for ways to win, eventually joining forces with the United States and leading the Allies to take down Hitler’s regime. All great leaders should abhor defeat and always strive to find winning options like Churchill did. Another secret to being a victorious leader is knowing how to create a winning team that is made up of diverse talents. A team can’t win if everyone has the same skills, just as a soccer team made up only of goalies won’t be any good at scoring. Therefore, successful leaders build teams made up of people with diverse skill sets that can face any number of challenges. But you need to make sure that these different people all share the same vision. If everyone is focused on different things, talent can be wasted. Winning coaches know the importance of teamwork and getting their players to focus on overall success instead of individual glory. For example, they make sure that players will pass the ball if a teammate has a better chance of scoring a goal. In the final blink, we’ll explore the importance of timing and its role in leadership. If you’ve ever tended to a garden, you know the importance of planting the seeds at the right time. Too early, and the soil might freeze; too late, and you might end up with a poor harvest. It’s the same with leadership and the Law of Timing. If a leader makes the wrong decision at the wrong time, it can often end in disaster. But it can be just as disastrous to make the right decision at the wrong time. This is what happened when hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans in 2005. Mayor Ray Nagin knew the right decision was to call for an evacuation, but he hesitated. Even as the cities around New Orleans issued mandatory orders for people to leave, it took another half day for Nagin to make the right move and turn his call for a voluntary evacuation into a mandatory one. But by then it was far too late for citizens to safely leave the city, and many of them perished. Successful leaders, on the other hand, know the right time to make the right decision. They are decisive and have the experience to recognize when they need to seize an opportunity or prevent a catastrophe. Take Churchill again. He recognized the dangers of Hitler and reacted in time to increase the military preparedness of Great Britain, enabling it to persevere and eventually win. By understanding these fundamental laws of leadership, you can greatly help your team surmount any challenge it may face. The key message in this book: Leaders are trustworthy and influential individuals who command respect from those who follow them. To earn that kind of respect and loyalty, there are certain traits and skills you should have: You must be influential, strong and trustworthy. You also need to be loyal to your followers and pursue victory single-mindedly, no matter how bad the situation. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

We get a gym membership and decide we’ll have those abs by summer. But then February rolls around, and we’re as gym-shy as we were in December. Why is that? Quite simply, it’s because we fail when it comes to execution. The same is true for companies. Being capable of change is what makes companies succeed – but changing requires execution. So how do you do it? As these blinks will show you, there are four disciplines you should try to follow to improve your execution and reach your goals. We aren’t talking about screaming at your employees or implementing draconic strictures. If you learn to incorporate these disciplines into your company it will become clear what your most important goals really are and you’ll succeed in one of the most difficult things there is: changing people’s behavior. In these blinks, you’ll learn what whirlwinds have to do with reaching your goals; why fuzzy goals won’t get you to the moon and back; and why you should always have a scoreboard in the office. Change is good, especially from a business standpoint. Why? Well, look at it this way: If you aren’t always improving, you’re creating an opportunity for your competition to swoop in. Preventing that is a big challenge. And here’s why: Even though there are an infinite number of possible growth strategies, there are only two ways to execute those strategies: with the stroke of a pen or by changing human behavior. Of course, stroke-of-the-pen actions are easy for executives. All they have to do is sign a paper and then someone, somewhere, will take care of the rest. But these are normally quick-fix actions. Lasting change, on the other hand, requires people to alter their behavior. That’s where most executives come up short – and not surprisingly. Anyone who’s ever stopped smoking or gone on a diet will concur: change is hard. And these examples only involve changing yourself. Changing others is even harder! After all, your staffers might not understand the company goal or have a clear sense of how changing their behavior will help achieve that goal. Alternatively, they might simply not care. At first glance, it may seem like there are easy fixes to these problems. You could just hand out detailed descriptions of company goals, be precise about each team member’s responsibilities and fire anyone who doesn’t care. But the heart of the problem is far more complex. All of these problems and decisions are called the whirlwind – a term the authors use to describe the daily tasks that take up your time and drain your creative energy. The whirlwind is the biggest foe of change. Imagine you spend an hour persuading someone to make certain changes; meanwhile, they’re busy thinking about the ten urgent things that need to be taken care of ASAP. Although it’s difficult, you can achieve major strategic goals despite the whirlwind. Mastering the four disciplines of execution makes it easier. And we’ll explain those to you in the upcoming blinks. The first discipline of execution is to focus solely on what matters. We understand the instinct to strive to do more. Since most executives are overachievers, they are particularly motivated in this respect. But the more you try to do, the less you’ll be able to focus on and put effort into individual tasks. If you want to achieve something truly excellent, you have to concentrate on it. Accordingly, your strategy should prioritize one or two Wildly Important Goals (WIGs), which you can pursue from within the whirlwind. Cutting costs by 20 percent by the end of the year is one example of a WIG, but here’s a general rule of thumb when you’re coming up with these goals: WIGs should be specific and have a huge impact on your team’s performance. Specificity is especially important because a WIG shouldn’t function like a vision or a mission statement. Rather, it’s about outlining a clear goal that the whole team will work toward. To understand why specificity can be so powerful, consider this story: In 1958, NASA operated under the vague goal of expanding “human knowledge of phenomena in the atmosphere and in space.” But that changed, in 1961, when President John F. Kennedy publically called on the agency to put a man on the moon and then return safely to Earth before the end of the decade. And that’s how, with one clear goal and a defined timeframe, Neil Armstrong ended up setting foot on the moon on July 21, 1969. As the NASA example makes clear, it’s important to find WIGs that make a major impact. You don’t want to use up all your blood, sweat and tears on something that doesn’t really make a difference for your company. As we learned in the previous blink, you have to focus on achieving wildly important goals. And to do so, you should concentrate on measures that help you win, not measures that make you depressed when you come up short. This is easier said than done, since most people naturally focus on lag measures. To clarify, lag measures reflect past performance, showing your position relative to your goal. Profit margins and customer satisfaction rankings are examples of lag measures. And although concentrating on those measures is natural, it does little to help you achieve your goal. The point is, these indicators reflect past events you can no longer change, which is why focusing on them can be disheartening. For instance, let’s say you’re trying to lose weight. It’s not a great idea to wait until the end of the month to jump on the scale and measure the result. Because if you don’t meet your goal, you’ll feel like a loser. And, by that point, it’ll be too late to do anything about it. This is why, to achieve your wildly important goals, you should instead focus on lead measures. In contrast to lag measures, lead measures reflect current behavior, meaning you can still influence them to help meet your goal. With the losing weight scenario, calorie counts and exercise metrics would be great lead measures, since they’re predictive of the weight-loss goal. After all, if you monitor your diet and exercise, you’ll most likely lose weight. Furthermore, these are two factors you have direct control over. Of course, we all know that the path to weight loss involves eating less junk food and exercising more. But knowing and doing are two different things. And you’re more likely to actually follow through on your plans when you keep track of lead measures, since these metrics show you how your current actions directly influence your goal. With the first two disciplines, you define your wildly important goal and identify which metrics will help you achieve it. The third discipline is about helping your staffers identify with the goal, thereby motivating them to help you achieve it! To that end, you should have your team keep score of team-member performance. This will improve performance, because, after all, everyone likes winning. And people instantly become more engaged when there’s a victory at stake. Accordingly, keeping score is a way of activating that game-face energy and motivation. For instance, when you watch kids playing football in the park, you can probably tell right away whether they’re keeping score – the way they cheer for every touchdown is all the information you need! And that’s why your team should create some kind of scoreboard tracking each person’s progress on the WIG. Whether you use a sophisticated online tool or an old-school chalkboard, the point is to show everyone how they’re performing. Since motivation is the goal of the scoreboard, you should make sure it’s comprehensible and also easy for your employees to manage autonomously. It should also include lead and lag measures, along with essential information about where the team should be and where it is in reality. With all this information clearly laid out, every team member must be able to tell, at a glance, whether they’re winning or losing. Let’s say that increasing production by 20 percent by year’s end is one of your WIGs. And to meet that goal, your team has to increase production by five percent each month. Your scoreboard should show lag and lead measures related to this specific goal, so your team knows how they’re actually performing. With the third discipline, we learned how to motivate staffers to be part of your wildly important goals. But the fourth discipline is the real heart of the execution process: It’s about making team members commit long-term to the goal. And in order for that to happen, your employees have to be accountable to each other – not just to you. No one wants to disappoint their peers, so staffers will feel a greater sense of responsibility if they have to answer to their colleagues, too. That’s why holding regular WIG meetings will ensure a lasting commitment to the goals. These gatherings should include: 1) an overview of the commitments from last week, 2) a review of the scoreboard and 3) a plan for the following week. These meetings will guarantee steady progress toward the WIG, since every team member will be responsible for setting and meeting weekly commitments that have an impact on the lead measures. It’s important to allow staffers to choose their commitments themselves, so they are engaged in the process. As team leader, your role is simply to make sure that commitments are specific and directly connected to the WIG. Valet parking services company, Town Park, offers a great example of how this works in action. When they adopted the Four Disciplines method, team leaders decided on the WIG of increasing customer satisfaction. To this end, they identified “reducing retrieval time” (i.e. the amount of time between a customer’s call for a car and the valet’s delivery of it) as an important lead measure. By focusing on this metric, the valets came up with an innovative solution: They would rotate cars from the back of the parking lot to the front whenever they knew a customer would soon be calling for it. So much for the four disciplines! But it’s not quite so simple: It takes real effort and commitment to implement them in your own workplace. Read on to learn how! Introducing the four disciplines to your own workplace might be tricky at first, but it will be well worth the effort! To install the first discipline (identifying a WIG), just follow these four easy steps: Start by gathering many ideas. Have conversations with both leaders and staffers to make sure you’re getting as much information as possible. Then, for the second step, rank these ideas based on the impact they would have on the overall WIG. For example, one big hotel chain’s WIG was to increase total profit from $54 to $62 million by the end of the year. So as their secondary WIG, the hotel decided to strengthen the alliance between its restaurant and local sports and culture venues. They figured this would drive more customers to the restaurant and hotel, ultimately helping them meet their profit goals. Next, test your ideas to ensure they’re aligned with your overall WIG. The restaurant in the example above could have mistakenly decided to broaden their restaurant menu as their secondary WIG – but that wouldn’t have necessarily boosted profit. That’s why testing your WIGs is so important. And then comes the final step, which is to identify a simple and clear definition of your goal. Ideally, you’d begin with a verb and follow by identifying the lag measure, a deliverable and a deadline. For instance: Reduce (verb) production costs (lag measure) from 20 to 15 million (deliverable) by December 31st (deadline).   You can follow these exact same steps to select your lead measures, thus implementing the second discipline. It’s especially useful to constantly re-evaluate and test your lead measures, thus making sure that they are predictive, precise and measurable. As we saw in the previous blink, you can follow a few simple steps to install the first and second disciplines. You can’t introduce the third and fourth disciplines with such methodic neatness – but some kind of plan is required. Let’s start with the third discipline. Setting a scoreboard requires less involvement from you than any other step. All you have to do is come up with the preliminary theme – a speedometer, a bar chart or something else entirely. Then step back and ask your team to design and build the board. That way, they’ll be even more engaged with the process. (Remember to tell them that a good scoreboard should only include essential information: the goal and the lead and lag measures.) And once the board is up, appoint someone to update the score on a regular basis. Then comes the fourth discipline. Installing a culture of accountability requires you to set an example for your team. This is a critical step – the fourth discipline is the heart of execution – but it’s also a difficult one, because it requires true commitment and dedication. Remember: Once you decide on a weekly meeting, you have to attend each time. Start the meeting by reporting on your own commitments, to show that it’s not a scary or painful thing to do. Then, make sure to review the updated scoreboard and celebrate every success. Keep in mind that the whirlwind has nothing to do with the WIG meeting, and make sure you’re only discussing WIGs. All team members who don’t meet their WIG commitment because of the whirlwind should be held accountable. If they don’t meet a commitment, make sure you handle it respectfully. Let the staffer know you value their work, but explain that it’s crucial, for the sake of the whole team, that everyone follow through on their WIG commitments. And then, make sure to give them a chance to catch up on their commitment. If you want to implement the Four Disciplines at a large organization with more than ten different departments, make sure you plan it out carefully. This process involves six steps: First, clearly define your overall primary WIG. Next, involve the team leaders: Each department head should define one individual WIG (and appropriate lead measures) that aligns with the overall WIG. As the institution leader, you can veto certain goals that seem incompatible with the organization’s broader goals, but make sure each manager has the freedom to choose her own WIG. Otherwise, you won’t get the level of engagement that you’re looking for. Third, sit down with the team leaders to teach them about the Four Disciplines model. After all, they’ll need to execute this process within their own departments! After that, each team leader goes ahead and launches the process with her own team. They should also ask for feedback and get their department’s approval for moving forward on the WIGs and lead measures. In the fifth step, individual teams work on perfecting the method. Ideally, department heads should get additional coaching on the process for a period of at least three months. And, finally, wrap it all up by setting up quarterly meetings with all the team leaders to discuss the progress you’re making together as an organization. And there you have it! You’ve implemented a process that allows you to execute your vision and achieve your goals. The key message: Executing strategic goals requires changing people’s behavior in the midst of a whirlwind of urgent daily tasks. But to execute their vision across the organization, company leaders should focus on just one or two strategic goals and useful key measures.  Actionable advice: Choose a goal that will impact your performance. When you are choosing a wildly important goal, consider two sources: things within the whirlwind and things outside it. A wildly important goal from the whirlwind could be something that needs fixing as soon as possible or something your team already excels at and needs to use as leverage. Outside the whirlwind, you can usually choose among things that offer you the chance to gain strategic advantage, like including new product features.

Of course, for salesman and bankers the need to negotiate the best price is clear. But negotiation is important in other jobs too. When you need a pay raise you have to negotiate; if you want to buy a new home, you have to negotiate. In short, we could all benefit from learning a few negotiation skills. These blinks will show you those skills and how you can put them to use. In these blinks you’ll discover why having the wrong map is better than having no map at all; what jazz musicians can teach you about negotiation; and why negotiation is all about being flexible. Imagine you’re in an important salary negotiation, and you know exactly what you want: you know that you’re worth $120,000 per year – not less! – and so you naturally demand this amount. But what do you do when they say no? More than likely, you’ll lose confidence and control of the negotiation, and consequently leave the negotiating table with far less than you had expected. Well, it’s good that you knew what you wanted. But you hadn’t prepared a map that considers many acceptable paths and outcomes so that you can make the most of your negotiations. Your map should start by first identifying what your ultimate target is, i.e., your stretch goal, along with several baselines, or minimum acceptable outcomes. This way, if your negotiating partner doesn’t accept your stretch goal, then you have something else to fall back on. Baselines are important, as your negotiating partner has their own goals which often contradict with your own. Let’s look at that hypothetical salary negotiation: if your stretch goal of $120,000 is rejected, then you can fall back on your baselines. Your baselines might be things like “a yearly salary of $100,000” or “$90,000 plus stock options.” While maps are practically useful, they are also useful in another crucial way: just feeling like you know where you are going can give you the confidence you need to succeed. It was this very principle that saved a military patrol unit from certain death after becoming lost in the Swiss Alps back in the 1930s. The unit was in danger of dying in the wilderness when one soldier found a map in his pocket, which the team then followed to safety. The interesting thing here is that this wasn’t even a map of the Alps, but the Pyrenees! Yet, the assumption that they knew where they were heading nevertheless gave them the confidence to make it out alive. Just like you wouldn’t make a recipe without first preparing the ingredients, you should also thoroughly prepare yourself before negotiations. Before approaching your negotiation partner, ask yourself: “When is the best time to negotiate this particular deal?” You should always try to schedule negotiations at the most advantageous time. You wouldn’t, for example, try to sell your ski equipment in the spring! You’d be more prudent to wait until fall, when people are more interested in skiing, and thus your offer. Then ask: “How likely is it that we will come to an agreement? How much would I benefit from this agreement?” You should seriously reconsider putting a whole lot of effort into a deal that you think is unlikely to succeed. It would be better to spend those resources on something with a stronger chance of success. For example, you won’t get very far if you try to haggle down the price of vegetables at a supermarket. But you might at your local farmers’ market. If you’re in the mood to haggle, then that’s where you should concentrate your efforts. But even with the most thorough preparation, things won’t always go as planned. For this reason, it’s important to stay flexible and creative, and willing to come up with a Plan B. In the author’s workshops on negotiation, he often uses the example of a small business owner who wanted to expand his business by buying another small company in town. Unfortunately for him, the largest offer he could possibly make was still much less than the minimum price than the other owner expected. So, instead of buying the other company, the small business owner then offered to sell his own company to his negotiation partner, and made a very profitable deal out of it. As this example shows, when your plan has no chance of succeeding, then you sometimes have the opportunity to consider options that you hadn’t even considered before. Despite their knack for putting on a good poker face, professional negotiators get nervous, too. Sometimes they’re unsure about their odds of success or fear that they might embarrass themselves. Nevertheless, as professionals they are able to control their emotional reactions, which is crucial in negotiations. While you can’t control the circumstances you find yourself in, you can control your emotional response. Good negotiators must be able to embody several characteristics at once: they need to be calm and alert, patient and proactive, practical and creative. While each of these pairs seems like a direct contradiction, in reality they go hand-in-hand. A surgeon, for example, has to be calm and confident in his skills while also staying alert to the possibility of complications. And just like a surgeon, a good negotiator must be in an emotionally strong state of mind at all times. A good way to make sure you’re in the right emotional space is to identify the circumstances that trigger negative emotions, and avoid them altogether. For example, if you’re the kind of person who becomes angry when stuck in traffic, then you should plan in extra time on mornings when you need to negotiate. In addition, good negotiators are careful not to fall into “autopilot.” A routine that has helped you in the past can hinder you in the present, so never be too sure about anything. One great way to keep yourself from dozing off or turning on autopilot is to focus on more than just what your conversation partner says. Pay attention not only to what they say, but how they say it and what their body language is saying. So far, you’ve seen how to successfully prepare for negotiations. Our following blinks will show you what to do when things don’t go as planned. Successful negotiators know that they should always expect the unexpected. But how can you prepare yourself for these inevitable surprises? You’ll need to learn how to think on your feet – to improvise – and the best way to learn how is to think like an actor. Improvisation is an acting technique that forgoes learning text by heart, but instead focuses on spontaneous and impromptu interactions. The golden rule of improvisation is to “never say no.” If one actor opens by saying “Hi Patrick, how was Australia?” no one would reply with “Actually, my name is Andrew, and I just came back from India.” You work with what you’re given! The same goes for negotiation. Try not to say “no” unless something is truly unworthy of discussion. Instead, try to work with the offer. Moreover, actors also stay relaxed under pressure, and don’t frantically wonder what they are supposed to say next. Don’t try to find the perfect answer at the negotiating table. Not only is this unrealistic, but it will also cause panic and hesitation. Instead, approach negotiations as if you are an improvising actor, and trust that, with your preparation and mental presence, you will always be able to come up with a good answer, even if it’s not the best. You can also learn a lot about improvisation from jazz musicians. While orchestral musicians read notes from a sheet, jazz musicians can improvise a masterpiece without any sheet music simply by listening, adapting and influencing each other via melodies and rhythm. Likewise, adapting to circumstances, listening carefully and influencing others are fundamental for success in negotiations. It’s absolutely essential that you understand what the other party wants and expects from the negotiation. Only by paying close attention to subtle cues, such as the tone of their voice or nonverbal signs of anxiety, will you know when to address or avoid certain topics during the conversation. What do chess and negotiation have in common? Success in both require experience and foresight. Take this psychological experiment, for example, in which chess pieces were arranged in random order on a chessboard and then given to participants. Participants had only a glimpse of the board before they were asked then to recreate the arrangement of chess pieces. The results revealed that all of professional chess players’ knowledge and experience did nothing to help them recreate the board. In fact, they did no better than the average of participants. But when the experiment was repeated with arrangements from an actual chess game, professional players were much better at recreating them. They remember similar games from the past and were able to use those experiences to recreate the board. The same applies to negotiation: your ability to interpret the other side’s offers or tactical moves depends on your knowledge and experiences. And while your experience grows with every negotiation you handle, you can supplement your skills by doing things like reading books on negotiation, taking part in workshops and observing other people negotiate as often as you can. Taking it back to chess: even the best chess players can’t anticipate all possible moves. After 80 moves, they would have more options to consider than there are stars in our galaxy! It’s impossible to follow possible lines of play. So, instead, chess masters anticipate the lines of play that seem to have the best chances of winning the game. In a negotiation, this means considering those options which have the greatest possible benefits and the best odds of agreement (based on what has worked in the past). Nevertheless, your decision can always turn out to be wrong. Your opponent – both in chess and in negotiation – might see through your tactical moves, which would thus require you to change your strategy altogether. That’s why it’s so important to be able to improvise! People often say that “you never get a second chance to make a first impression,” and this is especially true in negotiation. First impressions establish both the atmosphere of the negotiation as well as your relationship with the negotiation partner. As such, it’s important that you follow these guidelines: First, watch your language! Use words and phrases that emphasize your shared interests. For example, rather than saying “I need to do X,” say things like “Let’s solve this problem together.” Second, be aware of your posture. Though you might not think it, your posture can have a great effect on your mood. If you have a confident and positive posture, like standing up straight and not crossing your arms, then you’ll feel confident and positive, and others will get that impression of you. Once you’ve made a good first impression, then you’re in the position to either accept or reject an offer. Only say “no” directly when their offer itself is totally unworkable. If the offer is workable but suboptimal, then it’s often worth continuing the conversation. If this unsatisfactory offer is their first offer, then there’s most likely room for improvement. Just be aware that pushing the other side too far could result in no deal. If you are in a situation where you have to reject an offer but don’t want to lose the deal altogether, then you can try the yes-no-yes approach. Imagine, for example, that a working mom’s boss asks her to work on a new project over the weekend. In order to say “yes” to her responsibilities as a parent, she’ll have to say “no” to her boss. But if she’s creative, then she can still say “yes” to her boss’ needs, for example, by offering to create a system whereby occasional weekend work is rewarded with free afternoons during the week. By using the yes-no-yes approach, you can stay true to your own wishes but also concede to the other person’s interests, thus allowing the negotiation to continue. Sometimes you will get stuck in your negotiation. So, what should you do? Give in, or get creative? Thinking outside the box is more than just a cliché – it’s essential. Sometimes, it’s the difference between success and months of wasted work. The writer commissioned to write FDR’s biography handed over a 1400-page manuscript to his publisher. The publisher asked him to significantly reduce its length, and because he didn’t want to waste all that work, the contract was canceled. Luckily, he later found another publishing company that liked his manuscript the way it was, and they suggested that he split it into two volumes. Both volumes were a huge success and are still in print today, but this was only possible because of the second publisher’s willingness to think beyond the traditional “one person one biography” and split the material into two books. Creativity also involves bringing in an outsider’s perspective. In fact, research has shown that people are better at solving problems for others than for themselves. This psychological distance between us and others can help to see things in a different light. Just think about how easy it is for you to give advice to your friends when they are struggling, yet you likewise struggle when you’re in the same situation. By being removed from the situation, your perspective may present more insight. It’s also important to think outside of financial terms. When we think of value in terms of money, a negotiation becomes often a zero-sum-game, whereby the more one party profits, the worse off the other party becomes. However, there is always a way to ensure that all parties benefit! One way is by offering security. For example, if you’re a basketball player, you might be more willing to accept an offer for less money if it means that your contract is for a longer term. What you lose in money you gain in security, thus sweetening the deal. All your hard work leading up to the negotiation is worthless if you don’t know how to close a deal and persuade your negotiation partner to say yes to you in the future. It’s important to always be honest and polite. Not only will this help you close the deal, but it will also make your negotiation partner more likely to agree with you in the future. When it boils down to it, would you want to make a deal with someone you felt was trying to deceive you? Even when it’s hard to be honest, it’s nonetheless important in forging the kinds of relationships that result in repeated business. But nicety alone won’t close the deal. You should also adopt these basic rules: First, emphasize loss. Studies on loss aversion have shown that people are far more likely to agree with you if you focus more on what they might lose than on what they might get. Imagine, for example, that you want to convince your boss that your company should get on board a new project. You can increase your chances of success by pointing out not only potential benefits, such as gaining new clients, but also the negative consequences of not getting on board, like the possibility of losing clients to innovative competitors. Second, keep it simple. Research shows that people are less likely to come to any decision at all when they’re faced with too many options. In one famous study, for example, supermarket customers were offered tastes of different jams. Of those who were offered only a few different types, 30 percent decided to buy a jar. But of those offered a selection of 24 different varieties, only three percent decided to buy any! Don’t leave your negotiation partner befuddled by an over-abundance of choice. Just stick with the few options you think have the best chances of success. Imagine that you want to buy a cabin in the woods. One day you discover a “For Sale” sign on a beautiful little house, where the owner, a kind looking elderly woman, invites you in for tea. Her asking price is surprisingly low, meaning that you could easily afford it. So, what do you do? Accept the offer immediately, make her a counteroffer for less or tell this kind old woman her house is worth far more? Let’s assume you buy the house for the asking price without reservations. Yet, some years in the future you decide to sell the house because you’ve discovered that a new highway is planned for construction nearby. A young couple is interested in the house and asks you why you want to sell in the first place. What do you do? Do you admit the truth or lie to them about your motivations? While these questions might be difficult to answer, they do offer some insight into the negotiation process. Firstly, as a buyer, make sure to always ask specific questions about the condition of the item and the circumstances surrounding the sale. Most people tell the truth when asked directly. Secondly, as a seller, always consider what information you can give potential buyers. But try to keep things in perspective: think about whether you would recommend someone else to do the same in your situation, or whether you would want others to treat you the same way. And don’t forget, the way people feel about the deal will be the way they remember you forever! If the old woman was your grandmother, wouldn’t you want buyers to pay her a fair price? And if you were this young couple, wouldn’t you expect to be informed about the planned construction? Ultimately, the way you decide to handle the ethics of negotiation is up to you. Just think about how you would feel if the situation were reversed. The key message in this book: Just like no two people are the same, likewise no two negotiations are the same. Each comes with its own quirks, which means that the ability to think on your feet and improvise is of utmost importance. Actionable advice: Make some time to meditate this evening. Studies have shown that yoga and meditation not only help to reduce stress, but can also help increase your problem-solving skills and productivity – both of which are essential to negotiations.

Business leaders who hide in the shadows, waiting their turn, will never succeed.  Today’s dynamic, ever-changing economy requires a businessperson to be aggressive to keep up. Once-thriving markets can disappear at the drop of a hat, and previously ignored backwaters can transform into money-making tidal waves in moments. Only those with their finger on the pulse of industry, executives poised to attack the next hot opportunity, will succeed. So how do you learn how to attack and win an advantage in business? These blinks will give you the tools you need to seize the day. In these blinks, you’ll discover how Ted Turner’s mind-set is what made him a media mogul; why Finnish technology giant Nokia lost its market edge; and how passive executives can block your best attempts at forward thinking.  The world economy will grow by $30 trillion over the next decade – great news for any business!  To make the most of this growth, however, you’ll need to know in which industries to invest and which technologies will dominate the market.  This isn’t easy. Why? Because every industry faces structural uncertainty. Structural uncertainty arises from external circumstances, and by nature cannot be controlled. For example, internal issues concerning supply or human resources create operational uncertainties, which are easier to spot and prevent. Structural uncertainties, on the other hand, can land even long-established business leaders in trouble.  A technological innovation that turns an industry inside-out is a classic case of structural uncertainty. For example, computer manufacturer Dell was a market leader and enjoyed massive profit margins. That is, until the 2000s when Apple introduced the tablet. This new technology triggered a drastic drop in demand for personal computers and laptops, Dell’s bread and butter. This structural uncertainty resulted in Dell’s share price plummeting. And Dell never saw it coming!  Though structural uncertainties often take a company by surprise, it is possible to spot them ahead of time. Signals and hints are often right under our noses. The thing is, leaders fail to take them seriously.  This was Nokia’s mistake in the wake of the market introduction of the smartphone, a structural uncertainty about which the company was undoubtedly long aware.  Nokia executives had been researching smartphone technology, and knew that Apple was also filing a series of patents. It was the company’s failure to act on these warning signs that led to it relinquishing its dominant position in the cell phone market.  If you don’t want to become a Dell or a Nokia, you need to learn how to spot uncertainty – and how to act quickly when you do. But what’s the first step? We’ll explore some strategies in the following blinks.  What do you call someone who responds to a change before it even happens? Not a psychic. Individuals who can spot developments early in an industry and do something about them are called catalysts.  Catalysts have the ability to pick out patterns in a mess of possibilities to see how and why industry-wide change might occur. We call this perceptual acuity.  So how do catalysts use perceptual acuity to their advantage? A catalyst starts by identifying seeds. Seeds are the events that could grow and flourish into a truly innovative idea. Patents are great examples of seeds. Filed and granted, but never widely used, patents for underrated innovations often provide the spark for any massive shift in how an industry works.  It is these sorts of innovations that catalysts identify and work to build upon.  Catalyst Paul Breedlove rediscovered a particular speech recognition technology that was invented in the 1960s by researcher Bishnu Atal of Bell Labs in New Jersey. Atal had won awards at the time, but his technology was later forgotten.  Breedlove however decided to hire Atal as a consultant in the late 1970s, investing $25,000 with the goal of creating a children’s digital learning game called “Speak and Spell.” The device was a huge success, yet it wouldn’t have been possible without Atal’s seed technology.  A seed in the form of a patent is relatively easy to find and identify. But catalysts with sophisticated perceptual acuity can find seeds in the most unexpected places. This can happen when a catalyst uses a seed to bring two unrelated industries together.  Thanks to the perceptual acuity of Ted Turner, we enjoy the innovation that is satellite TV. Before Turner, satellites were used to transmit data to research centers, while television cable networks were still an early industry.  Turner saw a seed in the potential merger of these two unrelated technologies, creating a nationwide television broadcast system to beam signals to satellites and transmit them via cable to television sets.  As a catalyst, you’d be a great asset for any growing, innovative business. But what if your perceptual acuity isn’t quite up to scratch? Here are three strategies to improve your seed-spotting ability.  Start by testing your perceptive acuity by chatting with people from other industries or executives who deal with different challenges than you do on a daily basis.  One CEO of a $10 billion business did just this, bringing together four other CEOs from different sectors, including consumer goods, finance, information technology and heavy industry.  These executives decided to meet four times a year to bounce ideas off each other and share perspectives. By combining their knowledge specialities, each business leader individually boosted his or her ability to see the “big picture,” gaining excellent foresight as a result.  It wasn’t long before these same CEOs made a habit of seeking advice from experts from different sectors all the time. This helped them spot potential structural uncertainties ahead of the competition.  Reading broadly is another way to gather the knowledge you need to hone your perceptual acuity.  Warren Buffett reads 500 transcripts of investor calls, in which companies discuss financial performance and corporate vision, every year. This incredible amount of information allows Buffett to make insightful decisions across industries.  You can hone your perceptual acuity by continuously keeping your eyes peeled for possibilities. Blackstone Group CEO Steve Schwarzman dedicates each Monday morning to identifying anomalies in the external business landscape. He invites other sharp-sighted guests to these meetings, to share what they’ve noticed, what they feel is “new” and who key industry catalysts are.  You’ve probably heard that the best defense is a good offence. This statement is especially true when it comes to structural uncertainties. You might think you don’t need to use aggressive tactics, as your industry seems so stable. The reality is, no industry is truly stable or safe.  Every industry can suffer structural uncertainty. Change is inevitable, so you need to learn how to grapple with change when it happens. How? By making change your own.  Cloud computing started to emerge in the early 2000s. Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen early on recognized its potential for his company. He realised that cloud computing would reduce fixed costs for customers, replacing Adobe’s existing model of providing hard copies of licensed software.  He encouraged his company’s board to invest early in fostering new computing capabilities and successfully acquired some smaller cloud computing companies before they got big.  And as Narayen predicted, the era of the cloud finally arrived. Yet Adobe was ahead of the game and not only crushed the competition, but also made cloud computing its own.  Despite the advantages of pursuing aggressive tactics, not every company or individual will be able to adopt such a strategy. Yet people who are passive can create blockages and slow your business down.  The author tells the story of Tiptop Snacks CEO Gail Jones, who was concerned about a declining sweets market and growing competition. She hired a consultant with the resolve to get her managers thinking more about attack than defense with regard to the company’s strategy.  All her managers developed a new, aggressive mind-set and applied courageous lateral thinking to day-to-day operations and plans for future growth – except three managers who didn’t feel up to the challenge. Although they were valued employees, their passivity was holding the company back and they were let go.  Have you worked out where to find the seeds in your industry and how to map a path forward? Great! Now you need to make sure your company’s internal decision-making is aligned along this path, too.  Every person who makes key decisions in your company needs to know which pivotal choices your business will be making. On top of this, nodes, or points where decisions are made, must be identified.  To identify decision nodes, we start with the action that needs to be taken, and work backward.  For instance, to succeed in a foreign market such as Guatemala, choices about a company’s product mix and pricing should be made by local managers – and not by executives far away in New York City. Expert knowledge of the local market makes local Guatemalan managers a crucial decision node for successful company growth.  After identifying your nodes, you need to ensure your employees have the skills they need to succeed. Crucial decisions require expertise and a range of talents, from communications to negotiations to marketing.  Employees in decision nodes must also be in agreement with company goals, and should not use their power to prevent changes they don’t like or don’t want to see. The assumptions made and factors influencing these decisions should also be observed and evaluated.  Communications company Acme Media used this process to ensure it moved smoothly from print to digital. Countless meetings helped prime the company for this switch, yet for some reason, things weren’t moving along efficiently.  The company CEO finally identified the senior officer who was the stick in the mud. This executive was responsible for driving the digital transition, but had made her name in print media and lacked the skills and desire to make the shift. New talent was brought in; and the transition proceeded smoothly.  It’s great to have innovative ideas, but there’s no point if you can’t turn them into reality. Of course, working out how to implement a radically new idea is by no means easy! But there are ways to do it.  Your plan should begin with your final destination. If you know what you want to achieve, work backward to identify the necessary steps along the way. These steps are your short-term goals.  Though working toward these goals might hinder short-term performance, this is only temporary. Transition is never easy, but it’s worth it if you want your company to thrive long term. The final destination, not just quarterly sales numbers, is what forward-thinking business leaders keep in mind. In 2014, Tata Consultancy planned to create a new business to help clients make the digital shift. The journey to this destination was made possible through the mapping of short-term goals, such as recruiting software experts and negotiating contracts.  Tata’s Seeta Hariharan recruited 300 engineers within seven months, a pivotal short-term step that made further progress toward the company’s end goal possible. A great plan needs great team members to make it happen!  By maintaining constant communication among leaders, managers and team members, you can ensure your company stays on track.  Verizon CEO Ivan Seidenberg in 2004 proposed a visionary plan of creating a nationwide fiber optic cable network in the United States. This project was very expensive.  To ensure costs didn’t bring the plan immediately to a halt, Seidenberg held multiple meetings to ensure board members were updated on changing external factors, including competitor activity, emerging technologies and new regulations.  Seidenberg also invited experts to talk about new opportunities and ideas for future developments. By keeping tabs on anything and everything that could impact the project, Seidenberg made sure that the company stayed on track and was able to reach its end goal.  The key message in this book: By developing your perceptual acuity, you can learn to identify the seeds of structural uncertainties that may shake up the market in the future. Use your knowledge to push for change in your company ahead of time, and work to embed this sort of attack attitude in management circles.  Got feedback?

It’s either a ruthless, greedy backstabber like Gordon Gekko or an awkward, socially inept geek à la Mark Zuckerberg. Whichever image you think is more accurate, we can all agree that business is not a romantic occupation. Well, maybe this needs to change. In order to attract the customer and employee of the twenty-first century, businesses need to adopt a more human, romantic approach. Of course, no one is saying that CEOs should shower their customers with candle-lit dinners or bouquets of roses, so what do we mean? These blinks will show you how romance works in a business sense. In these blinks, you’ll discover why society is teaching us to reach out to people and to distrust them at the same time; why one social network has grown by paying people in pizzas; and why when you leave a business, you should get out of there fast! We live in a strange world. In an age where likes are currency, connecting with others and sharing our lives seems to be our number one priority. Yet we’re more distrustful than ever.  More than half of the Millennial generation – those born between the early 1980s and the early 2000s – have shared photos of themselves online. This would seem to indicate a desire to reach out to other people, right? Why, then, do less than a fifth of Millennials say they trust others? This is a paradox that leaves us increasingly unhappy. How did we find ourselves here? Although social media platforms promise to connect us with others, they only serve to amplify our anxieties about social and economic status. There’s always going to be someone in your news feed who is making more money, traveling to more exciting places and, apparently, having more fun than you.  Of course, we won’t stand for this! Many of us work harder and harder, chasing pay rises and promotions to assure ourselves that we’re just as successful as our Facebook friends. Unfortunately, this means we’re drifting further and further away from what we really need: true connection with others.  But if we’re going to build authentic relationships with those around us, we don’t need to delete our Facebook accounts, leave our jobs and go off the grid. We can actually continue, more or less, the same activities. All we need is a change in mindset. Why not be a business romantic? Rather than working himself to the bone for financial reward, a business romantic looks for work that offers valuable experiences, and is happier because of this. Research by the Harvard Business Review reveals that employees who find meaning in their work are more likely to stay with their company, indicate higher job satisfaction and be more engaged. Unfortunately, business romantics are a rare breed. According to a 2013 Gallup poll conducted in 140 countries, only 13 percent of employees worldwide are fully involved in and enthusiastic about their jobs. Some 63 percent are “not engaged” and “lack motivation.” About 24 percent are “actively disengaged,” meaning that they are unhappy and unproductive, and subsequently spread negativity to coworkers. Companies would benefit enormously from turning their employees into business romantics. But how are they supposed to do that? Read on! What does your company care about more: your opportunities to have a chat with colleagues or getting your tasks done on time? Of course, the latter is the top priority. But should it be? A 2013 study conducted by the London School of Economics claims that there is only one aspect of work that creates happiness similar to that experienced outside the workplace: casual interactions with coworkers. Why, then, don’t our employers encourage socializing? The answer is obvious enough. It is widely believed that too much chatting harms productivity. Because efficiency and productivity are the foundations of businesses, we’re faced with the same message over and over: shut up and get back to work! Where does this leave businesses? With 87 percent of the workforce experiencing negative feelings that range from “lack of motivation” to “active disengagement,” that’s where. If businesses want to engage their Millennial employees, they need to flip their approach. Instead of policing workplace banter, businesses should let it thrive. Happy employees experience higher satisfaction. And nothing makes people happier than connecting with others. Case in point: The author invited 15 people for a dinner called the “15 Toasts” during the World Economic Forum. His guests were leaders in the private sector, government and civil society, and they were all total strangers to each other. Not for long, though. The author asked each guest to offer a toast that answered the question: What is a good life? The toasts began slowly but the guests soon rose to the occasion. Rather than forcing 15 strangers to discuss prearranged topics, this dinner gave them the opportunity to engage as human beings. One guest remarked that it was the first dinner he’d been to where he didn’t know anyone, yet left feeling genuinely connected with every single guest. There’s nothing more deeply human than the act of giving. By giving a gift, we don’t only make the recipient happy. We experience joy, too, feeling like a better person. It should come as no surprise that giving is a cornerstone of romantic business.  Wharton Business School professor Adam Grant explored the power of generosity in the workplace in his book Give and Take. He asserts that altruism at the office works wonders for employee motivation. Grant suggests that by creating a workplace culture of giving, companies can expect an incredible improvement in collaboration, innovation, service excellence and quality assurance.  And the best way to generate an altruistic atmosphere? By offering employees the chance to give during one of their tasks. This a great chance for leaders to get creative. Chocolate manufacturer Anthon Berg created a pop-up store in Copenhagen where customers pay for their chocolate with the promise of a good deed for a loved one.  Social platform and entertainment website Reddit gives us another great example of embedding altruism in company culture.  Their campaign “Random Acts of Pizza” allows Reddit users to buy pizza for fellow users based on how funny, entertaining and creative their pizza requests are. This campaign centered on the simple act of giving without asking for anything in return, and it made working for and using Reddit even more fun.  Today, we enjoy the luxuries of instant shipping, near real-time delivery and an abundance of services on demand. Life has never been so convenient. But is this what we really want?  If so, then why do people camp out for three days in front of the Apple store? Because most customers are actually more interested in experiences, challenges and receiving rewards that they feel they’ve earned. Dramatic moments and grueling challenges are ultimately what makes a buying experience unique. As a result, the perceived value of a product skyrockets. Consider also why IKEA is so popular. Aside from the timeless design and great prices, customers love the fact that they can assemble the products themselves. A frustrating hour with an Allen key in one hand and a deceptively simple manual in the other make the finished piece of furniture all the more exciting.  Of course, companies have to strike a balance. If too little effort is involved in acquiring a product, customers won’t value it. But too much effort will only annoy them! If you can find the happy medium, you’ll have happy customers that love to suffer just a little for your product. Remember the saying, “what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas?” These days, what happens in Vegas seems to end up on Vine.com.  Our society loves to overshare, and many businesses decided to follow suit, thinking that openness and transparency would make them more appealing to their customers.  However, honesty isn’t the antidote for poor service. Twitter learned this the hard way during a six-hour Q&A session that users promptly filled with excruciating criticism, complaints and jibes.  Honesty is always the best policy, but firms can do their PR team a favor by instead playing up their mystique.  One master of mystique is McKinsey. Fortune has labeled McKinsey both the most well-known and the most secretive consulting firm on Earth. So how have they crafted this image? They don’t share what they don’t have to. Although they are happy to tell the world about their professionalism, their efficiency and their analytical rigor, they don’t overshare the nuts and bolts. Even clients who work with the firm are asked not to share what the company has done for them. All of this helps create a mysterious image that draws prospects in. If you want your company to connect with business romantics, be alluring! By keeping the secrets of success to yourself, you’ll pique customers’ interest. Most businesses place great importance on the beginning of a customer relationship. But it’s not just first impressions that are crucial. What really determines whether your customers return is the way transactions end. Companies that aren’t able to control their first impression on customers know this well. Take the airline industry, for example. The beginning of a flight experience is very rarely positive. Airlines have to grin and bear it while delays, waiting lines and frustrating regulations pile up. Because of this, they ensure the end of a flight is all the more pleasant. They thank us over the PA for flying with their airline, and flight attendants personally say goodbye to each passenger. The Dutch airline KLM even hands out miniature ceramic houses containing schnapps to charm their business-class passengers. Happy endings aren’t just for customers either – business relationships deserve them too. This is particularly important when things go awry, like they did for the author during a botched attempt at merging a design company and an engineering firm. After the project failed, the author decided to return to his previous job. But he felt he owed it to the other companies to clean up the mess, which meant his farewell lasted for three whole months. Goodbyes became tedious, relationships petered out and his authority faded altogether. This wasn’t the ending he had hoped for! The best ends to partnerships are always clear and clean. When Groupon founder and CEO Andrew Mason resigned, he wrote a letter to his 11,000 staff members. It opened with a joke and closed with the words “I was fired today.” His letter explained to his employees that he had lost the vision that the company needed, but was sure that the new CEO would restore it. This was a graceful and definite exit, and one that the whole company appreciated. Both Mason and the company then moved on to great successes. The key message in this book: If businesses want engaged employees and loyal customers, they’ll need to make some changes. Whether it’s through altruism, creative challenges, exclusivity or a personal touch, companies that create authentic experiences within the workplace and customer service will lead the new Millennial market.  Actionable advice:  Open up your office!  Bring your employees closer together through your office design. Swap closed doors for open-plan spaces, cold conference rooms for comfortable discussion spaces. Employees love nothing more than having a good chat with coworkers. This makes them happier, more engaged, and more productive!

However, many of them neither hold a higher-education degree nor come from a wealthy background. In fact, corporate success often has little to do with book smarts or a massive bankroll. Authors Botelho and Powell ran several extensive studies to pinpoint what is truly needed to become a leader of a successful company. These are skills that anyone can learn, and the steps to acquiring and implementing them are clearly outlined in these blinks. Supported by examples of eminent CEOs across an array of industries, you’ll see that there’s nothing stopping you from becoming the next Elon Musk or Indra Nooyi. In these blinks, you’ll discover what percentage of CEOs are introverts; how a garbageman became CEO of a $9 billion company; and when it’s OK to ask people about their underwear. Many of us believe that CEOs are somehow special and entirely different from the average employee. Furthermore, we believe that wealthy parents or exceptional intelligence is necessary to run a large company. However, the ghSMART project, which the authors were involved in, surveyed over 2,600 CEOs and what they found contradicts these beliefs. The majority of CEOs are just regular people who have developed leadership qualities over the course of their career. More than 70 percent of the CEOs surveyed claimed that they had no intention of becoming a CEO when they first started working. Let’s take Don Slager, for example. At the time of writing, Slager is the CEO of Republic Services, a $9 billion company and one of the top-500 wealthiest companies in the United States as rated by Fortune magazine. He never went to college but was ranked the number one CEO in the United States by the website Glassdoor. In fact, he started out as a garbageman for the company. By working his way up the ranks, Slager eventually became the head of one of the most well-known companies in the American waste-services industry. It was his knowledge of and familiarity with the general public, as well as the insights he’d gained from working in all areas of the company, that made Slager the best candidate for CEO. What’s more, the survey showed that you don’t need to be a genius to become a CEO. Indeed, those who put forth complicated ideas or use long words are typically viewed as bad CEOs. Moreover, they’re less likely to be hired at all. To give you some stats – only seven percent of CEOs graduated from an Ivy League school. Though Fortune 500 companies usually have Ivy League graduates among their leaders, the smaller, less-known firms don’t. But Ivy League schools aside, consider this: like Don Slager, eight percent of CEOs have never attended any college, so, clearly, lacking a formal higher-level education is no hindrance. You also don’t need to be an exceptionally outspoken person to be a CEO. Egoistic people make the worst CEOs since they’re too focused on their individual success. And, in fact, 30 percent of CEOs are introverts. Previously, we’ve shown that a college degree isn’t necessary to become the CEO of a lucrative company. But being highly intelligent is not a prerequisite either. In fact, CEOs who have a high IQ typically experience information paralysis. They are required to make important choices every day. There are many different avenues by which to arrive at a decision, such as being thoughtful, impulsive, logical or decisive. Out of these options, high-performing CEOs often opt for decisiveness, meaning the ability to decide quickly and with conviction. Indeed, the authors found in a study that decisiveness made CEOs 12 times more likely to be top performers. In addition to being quick, an overarching decision is usually better than one that’s detailed. To illustrate this argument, let’s take a look at Steve Gorman, who took over the bus company Greyhound Lines in 2003 when it was $140 million in debt. After being advised to either divide up the regions and sell off the company’s business in them, or to increase fare prices, Gorman had to decide quickly. Instead of consulting sales figures, he looked at a map of America. Gorman compared this map with the Greyhound route map and made the bold decision to stop all of the routes that serviced low-density populations. Thanks to this decisiveness, after four years, Greyhound Lines was making an annual profit of $30 million. So, like Gorman, find a winning formula for your specific business, and to stick to it. This is what Doug Peterson, CEO of McGraw Hill Financial, did. He succeeded by following the policy of Jack Welch, legendary CEO of the gigantic conglomerate General Electric. According to Welch’s rule, the company had to have the potential to become a number one or number two player in every new sector it entered, or he would turn down the opportunity. By following this formula, Peterson simplified decision-making throughout his entire organization and enabled his staff to make quicker decisions about market opportunities by themselves. The company sometimes turned down potentially lucrative takeover deals, but the simplicity and speed were worth more than any single buyout would have been. As mentioned earlier, a surprisingly large number of CEOs are introverts rather than extroverts. This is because, in order to be an effective CEO, you’ve got to be able to consider other people’s perspectives. Company owners need to understand what motivates customers, board members and stakeholders, which means that CEOs need to listen and have empathy. Introverts tend to be particularly adept at this. By truly listening to people, you avoid making assumptions, which is important. When it comes to other people’s perspectives and outlooks, you shouldn’t assume you know what they think. Instead, you should show genuine curiosity and pay attention when they’re talking about themselves. One CEO who employs this tactic particularly effectively is Neil Fiske. Though he is mainly known as the man who rescued the surf company Billabong, his biggest achievement came when he worked for a lingerie brand. Fiske interviewed women about their opinions on clothing, and he was mindful not to make assumptions. By listening and gathering as much information as he could, Fiske managed to turn the previously small company into a billion-dollar business. As the example illustrates, it’s important for CEOs to spend time getting to know their customers. Jim Donald has had leadership roles in many well-known successful brands, including Starbucks and Safeway. He attributes his success to spending half of his time out of the office and in the shops themselves. Donald’s strategy stemmed from advice given to him from his former boss at Walmart, Sam Walton, who said that the real business occurs among the customers and employees on the shop floor. Similarly, it’s vital to know the motivations behind the company’s board members. The benefits of getting to know board members shouldn’t be underestimated, and you should be aware of their individual aspirations and hopes, as well as how your company fits into that vision. Some key questions to be addressed include: How did they become a board member? Are they obligated to an investor or founder? What’s driving them to stay on the board? Is it money, prestige, intellectual stimulation? Finding the answers to these questions could help you achieve your goals for the company, because you’ll know what kind of decisions board members will be likely to back. If two candidates are competing for a CEO position, the one who appears most reliable will get the job. In fact, CEOs who are known to be reliable are twice as likely to be offered a position than those who don’t have that reputation. To present yourself as a reliable person, you must always follow through on your commitments. The Genome Project studied the personality traits of thousands of CEOs and found that 94 percent of them scored very high in the category of following through on commitments. Furthermore, those who displayed discipline, thoroughness and conscientiousness were highly favored, unlike the “mad geniuses,” who were less favorable due to their erratic behavior. So if your main argument for getting the job is that you can come up with crazy ideas and schemes, you may wish to rethink your strategy. Board members want leaders who they know will follow through on promises, even if the promises aren’t extravagant. They prefer a guaranteed modest outcome over an outlandish promise that has a low probability of being delivered. Thus, you can build your reputation for reliability by promising small things, but ensuring that you deliver on those small promises. You can also appear reliable by behaving consistently. To do so, you should not let yourself be swayed by mood swings or emotions. The CEO of Timberland, Jeff Schwartz, argues that your staff rely on you to be consistent so that they can approach you professionally. Whether you are consistently serious or always friendly, you’ll seem more approachable to your colleagues and employees if your moods are predictable. Additionally, preparing anecdotes about your prior experiences will help you sell yourself as a reliable CEO. When in an interview for a leadership position you can prove the fact that you’re a reliable choice by sharing a few anecdotes from the past. Think of previous situations in which you’ve overcome a mutual problem, highlighting how you’ve learned from those hardships and redeemed yourself. This will help you come across as someone who can be relied on to work through common problems should they arise in the future. When you’re leading a big organization, it’s almost impossible to micromanage everything. Therefore, you need to implement self-sustaining systems that have easily repeatable steps to ensure employees work efficiently. To do so, imagine yourself as a conductor of an orchestra. Rather than playing music, a conductor watches over everyone else from afar. To pull off a spectacular show, the conductor must work with the performers during rehearsal and ensure that everyone knows their role. Together, they work through the piece multiple times in order to reduce the likelihood of errors. On the big day, the conductor doesn’t need to do much, since the performers know what to do, having practiced the same pattern hundreds of times. This is what you should aim for as a CEO, too. In addition to envisioning yourself as a conductor, it can also be helpful to think like a Navy SEAL. Imagine you’re in a fight. You might think that the best thing to do would be to rely on your instincts, fight back hard and hope for the best. But this is exactly what Navy SEALs don’t do. They are taught to build a strong foundation beforehand so that in the face of rising pressure, they can call upon their repetitive training and avoid making any mistakes. Lastly, creating a well-planned system can also help prevent errors. In some cases, a reliable system can mean the difference between life and death. For example, the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia sometimes encountered errors in their treatment system. Not only were doctors and nurses making mistakes with dosages and treatments; they also tried to cover them up. Then it was revealed that it wasn’t the mistakes themselves that were causing most of the errors; it was the attempts to cover them up. So the hospital changed the system and decided to rename the errors, or near misses, as good catches. The staff member who disclosed the most near misses – either their own or somebody else’s – was given an award. As a result, medical errors fell by 80 percent. What do Blockbuster Video and Kodak have in common? Both are businesses that failed because they didn’t adapt to the future. One important aspect of planning for the future involves making room for new ideas by letting go of old ones. Though Kodak invented the first-ever digital camera, they waited 18 years to pursue the opportunity further. This missed opportunity was fateful for the company, which filed for bankruptcy in 2012. Similarly, video-rental company Blockbuster passed on all three opportunities to purchase Netflix, because it didn’t see the potential of an online business model. We now know that this was a big mistake, and Blockbuster, too, filed for bankruptcy. Both Kodak and Blockbuster failed because they weren’t able to let go of their old practices and adapt to the changing business landscape fast enough. In contrast, when Intel saw that Japanese companies had begun to produce memory chips at a lower cost, it knew it needed to act quickly. This new competition led to a drop in Intel’s profits, from $198 million in 1984 to $2 million just a year later. So Intel decided to focus wholly on producing microprocessors and drop its memory-chip-manufacturing business. The company’s willingness to adapt resulted in their market cap rising from $4 billion in the mid-1980s to $197 billion today. Clearly, then, staying on top of upcoming trends is vital for a company’s sustained success, but how can you manage that in an increasingly information-loaded world? The answer is to become a trendhunter. Jean Hoffman, CEO of pharmaceutical firm Putney, is a great example of a trendhunter. Hoffman was able to stay ahead of the game by studying the trends in human pharmacy and applying them to better forecast changes in veterinary medicine. But looking into the trends that lie outside of your industry is helpful, too. For instance, Disney World didn’t look at other theme parks to find a trend that they could adapt. Instead, they compared themselves to any case that involved family entertainment, meaning games, films, sports and toys. From their research, they learned that it would be beneficial to incorporate trends such as the Harry Potter phenomenon and trampolining into their operations. If you think you’re more important than the company you work for, then the chances you’ll get hired as a CEO are pretty slim. Employers look for team players who will act according to the company’s best interests, rather than those who act out of self-interest. So how do you show what you’ve got, if you’re not supposed to brag about your talents? To get there, try to be a big fish in a small pond. The authors carried out a study of 2,600 CEOs and found that 60 percent of those who had climbed the corporate ladder quickly – also known as “sprinters” – did so after having taken a lower position at a smaller firm. Smaller companies are more likely to accommodate change and ideas faster than big corporations, which usually have no time or room for your personal opinions. Furthermore, in a smaller company, it’s easier to get noticed. If you become recognized as the one who saved or expanded your company or department, you’ll find yourself being thrust into the spotlight in no time. For example, Damien McDonald declined a managerial position at Johnson and Johnson, a $50 billion firm, and chose to lead the $250 million spine division of Zimmer, a medical-device company. Under McDonald’s leadership, Zimmer saw growth of 12 percent, while the most he could have achieved at Johnson and Johnson would’ve probably been between one and two percent. Then, in 2016, LivaNova, another medical-device company, impressed by McDonald’s success, offered him the role of CEO. You also need to make sure you get noticed for the right reasons and by the right people. The first way to get noticed is by asking people at your company for advice. Everyone enjoys giving guidance, and by doing so, they’ll become invested in and support your success. Alternatively, you could offer skills that the company is lacking, which is typically computer and technology expertise. Everyone will notice when you become the go-to person for such areas. A third way to get noticed is to become a staff member of an important figure in the company. As a personal assistant to a senior manager, you’ll be granted access to high-level meetings. This will provide you with key insights into company operations, as well as connections to the top brass, thereby creating a competitive edge for you. Once people recognize your talent, you’ll be well on your way to becoming a CEO. The key message in these blinks: CEOs aren’t superhuman. In fact, they’re just regular people who’ve developed certain skills that allow them to climb ranks in the workplace. Being decisive, consistent, committed and reliable are all fundamental traits of a CEO. Having a well-planned system in place is also important, as is understanding stakeholders and being able to adapt to the future. Actionable advice: Use an authoritative voice Next time you’re in a meeting or an interview, use simple language, be clear and don’t rush when you speak. Remember to pause for dramatic effect when you want a message to really sink in. These speech patterns will project your authority and help ensure that your listeners will really hear you.

You probably send emails, talk on the phone or hold video conferences. Maybe you download some reports on statistics, use a CRM system or promote your business on the company website. These are just a few of the things that the Chief Information Officer – the CIO – is responsible for. So how can all these different responsibilities be combined in one role? It’s not an easy task. IT is now an integral part of most businesses, which means that more and more businesses depend on the leadership of their CIO. As most companies know, IT can be the source of much frustration and farce. But there is another side to IT – the strategic side that tackles the problems of how to develop the business, improve its systems and create trust and continuity. In these blinks, we’ll explore what can be done to bridge the gap between the two parts of the CIO role. In these blinks, you’ll discover why the CIO of Boeing decided to bring in outside revenue to the business; how outsourcing can stimulate innovation; and why Kimberly-Clark’s CIO started a video blog.  The job of the Chief Information Officer is paradoxical. CIOs must be cost-efficient and stick to proven, safe solutions. At the same time, they must invest in innovation and take risks. So how do you balance these contradictory demands?  One way to pursue both goals is to simplify the IT organization and make it easier for employees to understand. IT is costly, complex and, for most companies, absolutely vital. To the average employee, however, it often seems not only high-cost but inconvenient and out of touch with the business itself. That’s not how it has to be, though. Because IT at it’s best is both cost-efficient and great at solving problems. Geir Ramleth, the CIO of the global engineering giant Bechtel Group, found that employees often regard IT as the department responsible for setting up barriers that prevent work from getting done. So, when Ramleth joined Bechtel, he went about simplifying and streamlining the role his IT department played. Ramleth took the 33 different IT helpdesks Bechtel had around the world and turned them into one operation with a universal ticketing system and single phone number, available 24/7. They distributed this number to employees around the world, and, from call one, they increased the number of problems solved from just 20 percent to over 65 percent. At the same time, Ramleth’s strategy brought costs down by over 30 percent. Another way to encourage innovation is to give your team the time and space they need to focus on innovating. Tom Farrah, the CIO of Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc., found an effective way to do this. Farrah outsourced the routine, day-to-day operations of his IT department so that his internal team could spend their time focusing on innovation. With the mundane tasks of handling helpdesk tickets and network support out of the way, his team could focus on more innovative tracks like mobility and business intelligence. So, IT is just the department that answers the helpdesk phones, right? Well, such a limited view of IT, which exists even among company executives, can greatly diminish the important work that CIOs can accomplish. A good CIO makes sure that the IT department isn’t seen as merely serving a supportive function. Kim Hammonds, the CIO of Boeing, demonstrates how IT can influence company strategy and even bring in more revenue for a company.  Once, during a conference with 25 other airline-industry CIOs, Hammonds seized an opportunity to promote Boeing’s mobile security work. Other companies, it turned out, were struggling with their own mobile security, and wanted to buy Boeing’s solution. Hammonds sold the solution, a move that generated new revenue for the company. Hammonds also reinforced the importance of earning revenue by delegating 10 percent of her entire IT team to working on customer contracts. Separating the routine support duties from the strategic contract work allowed Hammonds’ team to focus on more important issues. Not all CIOs can influence company strategy as well as Hammonds, though. Despite being on the senior management team, CIOs usually lack the clout of other department heads. To strengthen their influence, CIOs should propose an IT development strategy right off the bat – even as early as the hiring interview! This is what Ron Kifer did when he was hired as CIO for American equipment manufacturer Applied Materials.  Kifer knew he was inheriting a dysfunctional IT environment. So, during his interview, Kifer explained his strategy for fixing the problem. This included four requirements that would ensure he would have the right amount of influence at the company. First, he would report directly to the CEO. Second, the CIO would be on equal footing with the other executives on the senior management team. Third, all IT teams would be under his control. And, lastly, he would be free to hire a new IT leadership team. By securing his autonomy within the company, Kifer was guaranteed a better chance of success. Running a truly global IT organization means taking into consideration multiple languages, cultures, time zones and currencies. This can make being a CIO extremely challenging. So how do you meet these demands? First of all, a CIO should know which processes are suited for globalization and which should stay local. After all, consumer expectations differ from country to country. For example, in India it’s not uncommon to wait in line for 45 minutes. For customers in Brazil, on the other hand, anything over a 20-second wait is enough to make them leave. It’s a common mistake to take a system that works in your country and attempt to use it in another country. John Dick, the former CIO of Western Union, faced this challenge when working as CIO of a company with thousands of local markets worldwide, and he stresses the importance of understanding how specific markets work and building systems accordingly. For example, many companies would love to have a standard global payroll system. But when it comes to getting paid, the US system may not be compatible with, say, a Malaysian one. Therefore, it may be more effective to establish a local payroll processor in each country. Communicating on a global scale is another challenge for CIOs. Sometimes you need to have a face-to-face meeting, but you simply can’t be physically present. This difficulty is also surmountable. You can use video, both for meetings and to spread your message. Ramon Baez, the CIO of Kimberly-Clark, started a video blog as part of his global communications strategy. After Baez posted a video on the importance of 360-degree-feedback, he quickly found that even the most reluctant team members started reaching out to him and giving feedback. If you’re not as tech-savvy as Baez, hire a communications specialist to help you produce videos for your organization. And don’t worry about repetition – saying something countless times doesn’t mean it’s reached every corner of the globe! Have you ever been saddled with an ancient cell phone at work because it’s the preferred device of the IT department? It might seem like a minor inconvenience, but these kinds of technology-based decisions can have a big impact on a CIO. It’s normal for employees to want to use the most up-to-date technology, and the CIO will be flooded with demands from every department: the CEO wants to use her iPad for conference calls; the sales team needs to access their customer database on the road; your administrative assistant will want to log into his corporate email account from his new iPhone. And, naturally, the more these requests are denied, the more IT-resenting employees there will be. Pressure to keep up with the latest technology makes the CIO’s life increasingly difficult, because CIOs are often forced to operate within the framework set by a company’s technological decisions from 15 or more years ago. Sales and marketing executives, in contrast, inherit no such challenges. So how can CIOs reconcile the software of today with the IT of yesteryear? A paradox indeed, with no easy solution. But we can learn from Tom Murphy, the former CIO of the pharmaceutical giant AmerisourceBergen, who had to deal with hundreds of applications within a faulty, 30-year-old mainframe, and managed to convince the CEO to invest in an upgrade. Murphy knew he had to persuade the CEO to invest in new software. To do this he created a visual presentation. Murphy polled the company leaders to determine which applications are considered the most important, and then created a color-coded chart that showed how over 50 percent of the most critical 80 applications failed at least once a month. Additionally, his data showed that, over time, these results would only get worse. With the help of a visual aid, Murphy provided a clear argument and convinced the CEO that new technology was a worthy investment. It’s not uncommon for there to be confusion about the role IT plays in an organization. Even CEOs sometimes misinterpret the function of the IT department, because their background is typically in finance, sales or operations – not IT. This misunderstanding between the CEO and CIO can lead to another paradox: you’re an integral part of every aspect of the business, yet you’re viewed as being a separate department altogether. To resolve this paradox, it’s crucial that the CIO builds relationships with the leaders of the other departments. The best way to create positive relationships is to ensure you come across as a colleague, not a technologist. This means paying attention to how you present yourself and the IT department in meetings, reports and conversation. It’s much easier for the CEO and other executives to understand the importance of IT when you cut the confusing techno-babble. Leslie Jones discovered this when she became CIO of Motorola Solutions, Inc. Her predecessor had filled the weekly reports to the executive committee with eight pages of technical details that only a CIO would understand. Jones discontinued these reports and put together a simple, clear, one-page weekly report instead. For her efforts, Jones received a note from the CEO congratulating her on delivering the best IT report he’d ever read. Leslie Jones also knows about the importance of communication between IT and the other company departments. When she came on board as CIO, she noticed that there was confusion about which person in the IT department should be contacted for certain issues. So, Jones simplified things. She appointed one individual from IT to be the contact person for each specific department, no matter whether the issue related to tech support or business. By electing one IT person as the contact for the marketing department, another for sales, and so on, Jones made it easy for every department to communicate with IT. So you’ve improved the functionality of the IT department and created a better work environment. Your job as CIO is complete, right? Not so fast. To really build a lasting legacy you need to make sure your successor is right for the job. This brings us to our final paradox: how do you groom a successor while keeping in mind that only a fraction of Fortune 500 companies adhere to their CIO’s succession plan? Let’s look at why that is. Often, when a CIO leaves, the CEO will want to bring in a replacement from outside. This is because CEOs are typically dissatisfied with the state of IT; every internal IT manager is tainted by association. And even if there is a strong internal candidate, that person has likely had too little contact thus far with the company executives to be taken seriously. These reasons can stack the deck against a CIO’s plans. Luckily, you can still groom a future CIO. First of all, ensure the successor candidate has plenty of interaction with the rest of the business. According to Barbara Cooper, the former CIO of Toyota Motor North America, 40 percent of your time should be dedicated to preparing the rest of the business for a future CIO by ensuring adequate interaction. Cooper did this by building a program for potential successors to establish real relationships with different departments and develop the skills they’ll need as a CIO. This program allows the CIO to select IT managers seen as potential successors to work on assignments with executives of other departments that can benefit from IT involvement. Barbara Cooper started this executive rotational initiative for her IT department, thus ensuring that her top IT managers got exposure to other parts of the business. It was a success, and became a company-wide program for future executives. The key message in this book: Today, technology is what enables a business to be successful. Therefore, IT should be seen as a crucial part of any business strategy. Yet, CIOs are constantly struggling to be taken into consideration. To overcome this CIO paradox, CIOs should look beyond the IT department and focus on how they can influence the entire business and instill an innovative mindset in their team. Actionable advice: Give your organization a motto.  A motto allows you to emphasize two or three attributes you would like your IT organization to be known for. A powerful mantra can be a great tool in bringing IT together with the business. Take the example of Tom Conophy, CIO of Intercontinental Hotels Group, whose mantra, “our mission is to transform technology to be the enabler of brand differentiation,” helped his team to create a new mindset focused on innovation.

Most people who try to answer this question will focus in on the quality of a team’s best players or coach, or examine their strategies. But in these blinks, you’ll learn that the real secret to winning in team sports lies in something else – or rather someone else – entirely: the team captain. In fact, when you look at what all the best sports teams throughout history have had in common, the pattern that emerges is that they have all had the same types of captains. These blinks will show you what kind of captain this is, as well as the skill set a winning captain must have. You’ll also discover whether a captain has to have superstar talent; what one captain’s broken cheekbone says about their role; and how a synchronized war dance can help your chances of winning. Every once in a while, a sports team comes along that’s so good, it’s practically invincible. Between 1956 and 1969, this was the case for the Boston Celtics basketball team. Their domination during this period shows how important one key player can be to a team’s success. In 1956, the Boston Celtics had yet to win a championship, but that year they picked up a promising new player, Bill Russell – and they would go on to win 11 championships over the next 13 years. But once Russell retired after the 1969 season, the team fell apart and wouldn’t win a title for another five years. We can see this same trend in many other sports and with several other teams, including the New York Yankees, and their star player, Yogi Berra. For the Australian football team, the Collingwood Magpies, their success coincided with the presence of their captain Syd Coventry. In each of these teams, this key player is inevitably promoted to the role of team captain, but they’re often not the kind of captain you might expect. To begin with, these players are rarely the most talented athletes on the team. Instead, they’re often what people would call an “average player,” and their coach will usually be able to point to one or two crucial skills that they lack. They also tend to be quiet types who avoid the spotlight and interviews. Generally speaking, these team captains are not the kind of players who offer leadership in the traditional sense. And they’re not the ones who dramatically score points at the last minute to pull off a heroic, game-saving win. So what is it that makes these captains so special that they can lead teams to glory, but that the same teams can’t win without them? What elusive abilities do they hold? Let’s find out in the blinks ahead. Society loves to put talent on a pedestal and worship those who possess an amazing singing voice, a deft hand for visual art, tremendous athletic prowess or a gift for mathematics. But when we take a closer look at team sports, we can see that talent isn’t the decisive factor for winning trophies. In many other areas of life, we can see a direct correlation between having a talent cluster and getting amazing results. In 2010, a study at the University of Texas showed that the best teams for accomplishing intellectual tasks are the ones in which a majority of the members have above-average skills – in other words, a talent cluster. But this isn’t the case for team sports. In fact, the sports teams with the most talent are generally not the ones winning championship titles. In 2000, the Spanish football team Real Madrid did everything it could to recruit the world’s top talent, including star players Luis Figo, Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo and David Beckham. But after a strong showing in their first seasons, the team went on to suffer three consecutive seasons without a trophy. The truth is, you can’t buy a winning team, no matter how many millions of dollars you spend. Nevertheless, many people have tried, working under the misconception that with enough resources, a team is bound to be successful. But it’s easy to prove that this strategy is a waste of money. Many of the best teams in history reached their peak while being relatively poor. The Collingwood Magpies are an Australian football team that had a famous winning streak in the 1920s. The team won four Grand Final titles despite being so broke that other teams kept buying up their best players. So, for the teams that achieve those legendary winning streaks, it’s not about talent or money. The American football coach Vince Lombardi is often brought up when people discuss the greatest coaches of all time. Many credit his motivational skills as being instrumental in turning his team, the Green Bay Packers, into NFL champions and Super Bowl winners. However, while brilliant coaches can be influential in a team’s success, they’re not necessarily a requirement. If we turn our attention back to the Collingwood Magpies, the team won four championship titles between 1927 and 1939 with the help of Jock McHale, who had already won two championships while coaching other teams. McHale was a highly innovative coach, so his influence can indeed be seen as a contributing factor to the team’s success. In this case, he came to the team with unique training methods that favored fast-paced improvisation over fixed routines. But there are plenty of examples of teams rising to greatness while being coached by people with little to no experience or influential methods. This was the case for the Hungarian football team, the Mighty Magyars, who ruled the footballing world in the first half of the 1950s despite being coached by the unremarkable Gustav Sebes. Another example is the amazing Australian field hockey team, the Kookaburras, which had a decidedly average coach in Ric Charlesworth. There are also countless teams that continued a brilliant winning streak despite switching from one coach to another. What history shows us is that even the best coach will still need a great captain if they hope to attain greatness. While Jock McHale was an incredible influence and motivator for the Collingwood Magpies, it wasn’t until he brought Syd Coventry on as captain in 1927 that the team began to reach greatness. McHale had a great “all for one” philosophy that he tried to impart on his team, but it didn’t show up on the pitch until Coventry turned that attitude into action. He was completely selfless on the field and would just as soon assist someone else’s goal before scoring one himself. In the end, it took the arrival of Captain Coventry for the Magpies to become legendary champions. If you’ve watched any movie about a sports team, you know there’s always a moment when one team is facing a crushing loss until one of their players makes a desperate but brilliant play that turns the tide. These moments of desperation and courage in the face of adversity are exactly the kind of moments that can inspire a team to give it their all. This is important because athletes and players tend to give less than their all when they’re part of a team. In 1913, the French professor, Maximilien Ringelmann, observed that people generally put in less effort when they’re part of a team compared to the effort they’ll expend when working solo. For instance, in a game of tug-of-war, participants use less force when part of a team than they would in an individual contest. Professor Ringelmann referred to this phenomenon as social loafing. In 1979, scientists at Ohio State University put Ringelmann’s findings to the test when they added another layer to their experiment in the form of a coach. In their experiments, the scientists looked at how loudly people would shout when they were alone versus in a pair. The results confirmed Ringelmann’s theory – that is, until a third party was introduced to tell the individuals that their partner, or teammate, excelled at shouting. As a result, people began to shout just as loudly in pairs as they had done alone, because they were properly motivated. We see this same principle in practice in sports, for example when a coach tells their team that they’re expected to work as hard as the captain does. But, of course, for this to be effective, you need a truly hard-working captain like, say, Carles Puyol. As captain of the FC Barcelona football team of the 2000s, Puyol wasn’t afraid to get dirty and throw himself at the ball to save a goal, even after a teammate had made a mistake. He was so willing to sacrifice his body for his team that he once broke his cheekbone trying to block a shot. This kind of determination is a sign of a great captain – the kind of player who inspires a team to rise up and give everything they have. There are two activities in which society seems to think it’s acceptable for people to hurt one another for victory: war and sports. However, in both cases, the people involved will be heavily scrutinized over the methods they use. Sports fans have a specific – and often misguided – set of expectations for how a team captain should behave. They generally prefer when their team’s captain is a shining example of prim and proper behavior, the kind of player that can serve as a role model for every fan. And heaven forbid they fail to meet these expectations. When David Beckham was captain of England’s football team in the 2000s, he was subject to relentless criticism about his haircut, which was deemed to be unmasculine, as were the tears he shed after a tough loss. Displaying the “appropriate” qualities can be more important to fans than a winning record. Take Derek Jeter, for example, who became the captain of the New York Yankees in 2003. Calm, consistent and a solid family man, Jeter was always admired by his fans, even though his time as captain resulted in very few trophies. What fans sometimes miss is the fact that players who are always on their best behavior don’t necessarily make the best captains. Instead, great teams are led by players who aren’t afraid to bend the rules or risk being unpopular. During a 2015 Rugby World Cup match, the captain of New Zealand’s All Blacks team was Richie McCaw, a player who gave everything he had to help his team win. During one match, McCaw found himself flat on the ground, while a player from the opposing team had the ball and an open field in front of him. McCaw did the only thing he could and tripped up the player, drawing a penalty and many vicious boos from the crowd – but also preventing the opposing team from scoring a try. Even so, it was clear to his team that McCaw was relentless in his drive to win, and his team won the match in the end, which was far more important than pleasing the crowd. That’s the sign of a great captain. Superstar players are the kind that will get the ball as the clock is seconds away from hitting zero and score the game-winning goal or basket every time. But most captains aren’t this kind of ego-driven player and rely on different qualities to gain respect and lead their teams. More often than not, a team’s captain is hard at work at the back of the field doing the unglamorous tasks that are no less important – or difficult. Richie McCaw of New Zealand’s All Blacks played the position of flanker, a defensive position that takes a great physical toll, as it requires a lot of tackling and close contact. It was the same for Carla Overbeck, the former captain of the US national soccer team. She hardly ever scored goals, but was always assisting her teammates’ goals and making the right passes. This also points to how defensive players can lead their team by assisting others and creating opportunities for their teammates to be the very best they can be. Often, some of the best captains are on the sidelines, observing and finding the right time to jump in when they can be most effective. In the 1990s, the captain of the French football team was Didier Deschamps, who described his role as captain as having very little to do with his own performance – it was all about helping others. In Deschamps’s case, this meant finding ways to get the ball to Zinedine Zidane, the team’s star player and top goal scorer. In this team, Zidane relied on Deschamps just as much as Deschamps needed Zidane to win games. So even though Zidane was the star, he had much less of an impact without the support of his captain, who was dedicated to creating opportunities for him to shine. This is how someone at the back of the field can be the leader, the one who everyone relies on for both inspiration and the opportunity to deliver the goods. But, as we’ll see in the next blink, the captain’s duties extend to off the field as well. We’ve seen how a captain’s dedicated performance can inspire his teammates. As such, you might think a team captain will also be the one in a team huddle giving impassioned, motivational speeches. We’ve certainly seen this plenty of times in Hollywood movies. But in reality, most team captains will leave the speeches to the coach or someone else. As captain of the French national handball team, Jerome Fernandez admitted to failing miserably at pep talks. And when this happens, it can end up hurting team morale more than helping it. This is also likely a reason why Carles Puyol, the captain of FC Barcelona, would never address his teammates with a speech. Even an extroverted player like Ferenc Puskas, the captain of the Hungarian football team during the 1950s, believed the speeches were someone else’s responsibility. But just because we associate speeches with leadership, it doesn’t mean captains aren’t using their words – they’re just doing it on a one-to-one basis. So yes, communication is indeed vital to the success of any team. In 2005, MIT’s Human Dynamics Laboratory studied different types of teams, including those working in hospitals and schools. Participants were recorded throughout the day to monitor their interactions and to make note of every minute detail about how they spoke and what their body language was saying. The study found that those who fit the category of a “natural leader” would circulate from one team member to the next and engage in brief but focused one-on-one discussions. We can see this play out in sports as well. In the 1998 FIFA World Cup, France was leading 2-0 against the defending champions Brazil. Zinedine Zidane had scored both goals, but at halftime he could barely stand up in the locker room. So his captain, Deschamps, took Zidane’s face in his hands and made his point clear: he couldn’t stop fighting until the game was over. Zidane used those words from his captain as motivation to get back on the field and, in the end, France won 3-0 to claim the country’s first World Cup. If you’ve played team sports, you may have experienced the thrill of everyone on your team locking in and feeling like your minds are all perfectly connected. Scientists and psychologists have known that humans have a capacity for herd-like behavior and group mentality. But it’s only been relatively recently that they’ve identified mirror neurons. This discovery was made in 2004 by researchers at the University of Wisconsin. They confirmed that mirror neurons are specific brain cells that are activated when we recognize emotions in other people, and cause us to experience those same emotions. The next time you experience contagious laughter or start crying when you see someone cry, you can blame your mirror neurons. Even though we don’t fully understand this aspect of human nature, team sports have always taken advantage of it. When team captains try to motivate their players, they seek to evoke emotions of determination and excitement. The captain will first bring these emotions up in herself, such that her teammates will recognize it and start sensing that excitement in themselves. There are a number of ways captains generate the emotions it takes to win games. Bill Russell of the Boston Celtics would stride onto the court and give an icy stare at the opposing team with his arms crossed in front of his chest as if he were the king of basketball. This wasn’t just a way of psyching out the competition; Russell was channelling a dominant spirit, the very emotions he wanted his teammates to pick up on in order to win. For New Zealand’s All Blacks rugby team, they conjure up the right emotions by performing a traditional haka war dance in front of an eager audience and a perplexed and sometimes intimidated opposing team. The performance of the haka involves the team captain shouting out to his players, who respond by shouting back in unison while performing powerful poses, facial expressions and gestures. While they didn’t know it when they first brought this Māori tradition onto the rugby field, such exercises were syncing up the players’ mirror neurons, which in turn caused them to play as a united, harmonious team. The key message in this book: The impressive winning streaks of the world’s best sports teams are not due to the oversized egos of their most talented superstars. Instead, those streaks are achieved by a winning combination of a savvy coach and a self-sacrificing captain who isn’t afraid of risking a negative public persona or putting his body on the line for the sake of the team. Actionable advice: Enable your teammates to do their best work. If you want to become a team captain, fight the urge to stand in the limelight and receive all the attention.

In today’s world, with rapidly changing markets and fierce global competition, only companies that can adapt to new realities and embrace change will survive. But how do you lay the foundation for a truly innovative, adaptable company? Rosabeth Moss Kanter has spent many years researching American Fortune 500 companies to determine the factors that contribute to a company’s ability to change. As these blinks will show you, good communication, fluid job titles and cross-departmental collaborations are just some of the things that will make sure your company stays on the cutting edge of innovation. In these blinks, you’ll learn why good communication is essential for change; what loading guns has to do with innovation; and why your project team needs to be protected from the outside world. Globalization has dramatically changed the rules of business in recent years. Traditionally, most industries were dominated by a few big corporations and markets were relatively stable. Today's businesses have to compete globally and survive in rapidly changing, volatile markets. Many organizations are failing to keep up. Why? One reason is that traditional organizations are often held back by their success formulas. When companies overcome their first set of challenges, they typically develop a success formula that outlines the way the organization should be run. It can address issues like production techniques or the company's structure. The point is that since the formula worked for the business in the past, it becomes the standard protocol. This can seriously impede innovation. The author conducted research on a textile manufacturer that struggled with just this issue. The company had experienced problems with yarn breaking since it first went into operation, so the owners considered this to be a normal cost of the business and didn't try to fix it. Then a new plant manager joined the company. He worked to improve employee communication and eventually met a worker who had an idea for modifying the production technique to reduce breakage. He'd had the idea for 32 years, but he never shared it until he was asked. When the new manager asked the employee why he hadn't spoken up before, he said that the old manager simply hadn't been interested in changing the process. This shows how getting too comfortable in your routine can be detrimental. Change-averse organizations that cling to the status quo and don't promote collaboration are called segmentalist. In the modern business world, segmentalism is the main factor that determines whether a company adapts and thrives, or stagnates and fails. The author identified several behaviors that hinder innovation and change as she conducted her research on modern-day businesses. She termed these behaviors segmentalism. But what exactly is segmentalist behavior and why does it stifle innovation? Well, segmentalist organizations make it difficult for people to solve problems in creative ways. Even if the employees have valuable ideas, they're held back by the company's structure. The employees are confined to their narrowly defined roles in the business, so they don't have the opportunity or motivation to share their ideas. True innovation almost never surfaces within the bounds of one job or even one department. If you want to foster creativity, allow people to step outside of their usual roles and collaborate with others. When segmentalist organizations keep their employees in strictly defined roles, they smother innovation before it even begins. These organizations tend to be unnecessarily hierarchical and draw clear lines between departments to keep employees in their place. Sometimes segmentalist organizations will even encourage their departments to compete with one another, forcing their managers to hoard resources and guard their territory. As an example, one manufacturing company that the author visited needed to train their line workers; a manager found that she could train them more quickly and cheaply if she had a computer. However, she couldn't obtain a computer without going through a lot of bureaucracy, and no other manager wanted to take time away from their usual job and approve the funds for it. Meanwhile, mid-level managers from the IT department wouldn't help either. In fact, they even wanted to prevent her from getting a computer, because they feared it would threaten their roles and responsibilities. The manufacturing company in this example was highly segmentalist. If you want your organization to survive, be integrative instead. We've seen that an essential part of innovation is allowing people the freedom to step outside their usual roles. But why is this freedom so essential, and how do integrative organizations foster it? Integrative companies use complex organizational structures that encourage collaboration. Innovation actually requires quite a bit of complexity. If you want to foster innovation in your company, employees need access to more information and teams need to be more interconnected. People should have several ways of pooling together human and material resources. True innovation arises when people approach problems from different angles. People with different mindsets and areas of expertise need to come together to be truly creative. One way to achieve this is with a matrix organization. In a matrix organization, different departments and processes are all vertically integrated. Product design, production and sales, for example, are departments that are usually managed separately, but they're all united by a common goal: creating products that sell well. So in a matrix organization, these departments are connected in terms of their management, responsibilities and rewards. In other words, they're forced to collaborate. But company structure isn't the only key to fostering innovation. Employees also need broad, open-ended project assignments, which give them the space to decide for themselves how they will reach their goals. This sort of freedom also encourages creativity. The author researched a medical company that understood this point well. One of their manufacturing managers had been tasked with designing a new kind of machine. Upper management gave him a rough budget, but few other constraints – he was allowed to design the device on his own. He had the freedom to select his own team members and push forward his own ideas. He also got input from the manufacturing and design departments. Eventually, his design went into production and it sold very well. Innovation requires a certain degree of complexity and freedom, but that's not all you need. There are three basic commodities that are necessary for innovation: information, resources and support. Important changes can only come about with a free flow of information. Innovative ideas emerge when people approach problems from new perspectives, so it’s vital that they have access to multiple sources of information. The most innovative companies the author examined were those that maintained a face-to-face information culture. Companies like Chipco and Wang Laboratories, for example, use open communication systems across their entire organization, meaning that people at any level of the company hierarchy can suggest new ideas or offer criticism. Integrative organizations make it easier for their employees to obtain important resources. 3M, for instance, has innovation banks – funds for projects that employees can request without having to go through too much bureaucracy. People also need to be supported – with endorsements or approval – when they pursue their projects. A good way to do this is to rotate your employees through different jobs, as it allows them to establish more personal relationships and can improve support structures among colleagues. Within more entrepreneurial companies, it's normal for managers to make career moves that seem unusual. They might transfer from finance to manufacturing or HR, even if they don't have any formal training in these new areas. This rotation of roles is useful because it forces people from different perspectives to address new kinds of problems, which, in turn, often results in innovation. It also allows employees to build a network that stretches through different sections of the organization, making it easier for them to call on their peers when they need additional information or resources. Information, resources and support – power, in other words – are thus vital components of the creative process. Too much power circulation, however, can be counterproductive. An organization needs some degree of power circulation to allow for creativity, but you can have too much of a good thing. Without some limits on power circulation, employees might simply jump from project to project without staying on one long enough to finish it. It’s important to balance power circulation with focus, but how? An effective organization fosters the development of innovative ideas, then steers them in the right direction. Power circulation (through interconnectivity, complexity, freedom, diversity and so on) is necessary at first because it gives people the space to be creative. But later on, that same freedom can present problems. Too much freedom makes it difficult to agree on which proposals should be implemented, how they should be executed and by whom. That's why a greater concentration of power (through formalization, clear procedures and allocated funding) can actually bring a project to life. An organization certainly can't shift from power circulation to focused power at the drop of a hat; the best solution is to never fully disperse power, but to temporarily loosen it instead. This way, your employees enjoy autonomy, your organization won't fall victim to segmentalism and you'll still have an overarching structure for making strategic decisions. The headquarters of General Electric Medical Systems, for instance, serves as the central entity that oversees all of the company's important projects. There's enough decentralized power to allow for ideas and projects to develop on their own, but the headquarters retains its control over large expenditures and determines the company's overall strategy. They also give additional support to especially important projects. In the end, your organization needs to have enough decentralized power and creative complexity to foster creativity, but it also needs focused upper management that can drive its projects home. Even if an organization has provided its employees with sufficient information, resources and support, it still needs to ensure that their innovative ideas come to life. How? The first step toward implementing an idea is to collect enough information for a feasible and goal-oriented project definition. The author found that most project ideas emerged when people gathered information and ideas from within their job’s “neighborhood.” Hewlett Packard calls this management by walking around. It's when managers leave their offices to collect information and spread their ideas – or plant their seeds – so that others might help develop them. This is also an important part of building the company's network. A network of supporters helps mobilize the resources that projects need. Ultimately, you need people to buy in or sign on to your project by offering their time, money, information or influence. So the first step is usually to clear the investment, which means getting some sort of approval from your boss to seek wider support elsewhere in the organization. It's also a good idea to get some cheerleaders. This means making sure you have support from team members in lower-ranking positions than your own. Cheerleaders are important because executives are more likely to support your ideas when more people are backing you. At General Electric, for example, cheerleading is called loading the gun, and your peers are considered your ammunition. Another computer firm called it tin-cupping, because you're asking people to unselfishly help you out. After you've got enough resources and support to start your project, there's still work to be done: now it's time to focus on maintaining your momentum and driving the project home. There's another important truth that the author uncovered in her research: projects often fall apart over time, even if they start with the right information, resources and support. This is often caused by a lack of focus or external pressure from the rest of the organization. As a project manager, you need to look out for exactly these sorts of distractions. Criticism from the rest of the company can hurt your team's confidence and focus. When a project gathers momentum, it will usually get more attention from the rest of the organization. Other departments and people that aren't involved might start to interfere by voicing their criticism or getting involved in the project's bureaucracy. The project manager has to stay focused on PR and internal company politics, leaving the other details to the team. There are a few ways to deal with unnecessary criticism. Sometimes you can just ignore it and wait it out. You can also brush it aside by reminding people of how important it is to stay focused on the company's overall goals or mission. A Google project manager, for example, might defend their work by saying, “This project is directly connected to our highest mantra: don't be evil.” It's harder to be critical when the project is presented as a reflection of company values. Remember that it's your job to deal with criticism, not your team members' – their job is to focus on the project. Tom West, a project team leader from Data General, understood this when he managed a project to design a new computer. He deliberately kept his team unaware of the criticism and interference coming from other parts of the company. West and his managers had an unspoken agreement: “We won't pass on the garbage and the politics.” They didn't want anything to distract their team. When projects run for a long time, team members can start to lose motivation, especially if they have other responsibilities to attend to as well. If a project drags on, team members might even start to resent working on it. They may not put in their best effort, or might even try to kill the project internally. As the team leader, it’s your job to prevent this. Preserve your project's momentum by using team-building skills. Your team members won't stay motivated if they don't feel involved, or feel undervalued. It's a good idea to have team members meet regularly. This also ensures that everyone stays up to date on the project's developments. One manager at a computer chip company, for instance, noticed that his team was dragging their feet slightly. So he started holding regular meetings with the core members, sending status reports to all the stakeholders and giving frequent presentations about the project to the upper management. This reminded everyone of how important the project was, and the continuous flow of information kept everyone interested – they wanted to see what would happen next. You can also prevent things from slipping into a boring routine by having your executive supporters (or bosses) come by, even if it’s just to remind everyone of what they're working on. Bosses can also send everyone updates about the project. Finally, be sure to share the project's rewards with your team members. Innovative projects tend to get attention from upper management and can serve as career boosts. So praise your team's work in meetings and mention it to your superiors – it might help your team members’ careers and could also make them much more enthusiastic about the project. Getting employees to actively participate in projects is a crucial attribute of innovative organizations. Unfortunately, participation and teamwork can't solve all corporate problems on their own. It's certainly possible to foster too much teamwork and hold too many meetings. And doing so can make simple tasks very time consuming. For example, the author studied a company that used the term task force to define the company's policy on participation. The employees had to form task forces to address even the smallest of issues. This meant the team members were subjected to so many meetings that the conference rooms were always booked and the offices seemed empty. Understandably, the employees came to hate the task forces, and everyone just wanted to be left to work on their own. Sometimes unilateral decisions are more effective than group participation. The author found that teams function best when they're tasked with staying ahead of change, whether that's examining issues in new ways, providing each other with new kinds of assistance or discussing new ideas. Naturally, employee participation is not always appropriate. If one person clearly has more expertise on a given topic than everyone else, and the others accept that expertise as valid, there’s no need for additional deliberations when making a decision. So if there's only one biochemist and they say, “This substance is poisonous – we need something else,” you don't need a team to evaluate their statement. Participation is also unnecessary if the participants have nothing to contribute or aren't interested. When the project has very limited time or the employees are more productive when they're on their own, teamwork can actually be counterproductive. It's not always easy to know when group participation will be helpful or harmful. Remember that teamwork is just another tool – you don't always need to use it. Changing an entire organization is a change master's greatest skill. You have to promote participation and power circulation, as well as make resources available, but that's not all. The corporate culture, that is, your company's mindset, has to be ready for change too. The vice president of General Electric once said that if your company isn't fully prepared for innovation, your ideas won't break into the market, even if they're great. Your organization has to be ready to adjust to the changes that innovation entails. If the people in your company don't believe that change is possible, they won't be motivated to work toward it – if people don’t trust that change can actually come about, they won’t participate. The architecture of change requires a solid foundation, and a history of change within a company is a key factor in making future changes possible. If a company’s structure doesn’t support the new project, its foundation has to be changed first – companies need a strong foundation in order to support innovation. A plant manager at Honeywell, for example, was struggling to get his employees interested in quality circles, groups of workers responsible for reviewing and discussing quality standards in a department. He looked into the company history and found that the previous management had broken a lot of promises regarding change. They had even failed to fix the ventilation and reduce noise within the plant. The manager’s first step was make good on the old promises, which made the employees realize that change was actually possible within the company. He earned their trust and they took him seriously when he started implementing his own changes. Earning your employees' trust is the first step toward getting your company ready for change. The author uncovered an interesting fact about change-averse companies during her research: they interpret their own company history differently than companies that embrace change. Change-averse companies tend to insist that they haven't changed much since day one. Organizations that embrace change, on the other hand, openly stress the changes they've undergone. Why? Well, when companies emphasize the changes in their past, employees are more prepared for changes in the future. They see change in a positive light, as they'll understand that it's a necessary aspect of doing business. They'll also be more comfortable suggesting their own ideas on how to change things. When certain parts of a company's history of change are distorted, this also affects the company culture. Company history is usually airbrushed to an extent. For example, if a project is successful, top management might act like they supported it all along, even if it was controversial or faced a lot of opposition in the beginning. In reality, there's almost always some disagreement about a project before it starts. Usually, it’s only a small group of creative people that push a project forward until it can get enough support to take off. It's harmful to alter these company stories because doing so promotes a false understanding of change. Moreover, it discourages the employees from working hard to push forth their ideas. They might give up when they run into their first obstacle because they'll assume great projects are always accepted right away. That's why integrative companies that truly embrace change are always up-front about the changes in their past. Positive stories about change can inspire people to work toward more changes in the future. The key message in this book: Innovation requires decentralized power and more freedom for employees. Have your employees step outside their usual roles, while promoting openness and being honest about your company's history. Even if your employees have great ideas, they won't make a difference if your organization isn't structured to help them emerge. Actionable advice: An overseeing structure helps steer projects in the right direction. Never disperse power fully. The most effective strategy is to temporarily loosen it, granting people autonomy and freedom when they develop ideas, and preventing segmentalism from setting in. Be sure to preserve an overarching structure that can still make strategic decisions.

Helping clients overcome career hurdles, restore balance to their family lives or regain control of their emotions can feel more rewarding than any paycheck. But like any job, coaching also comes with a unique set of challenges for its practitioners. Establishing the right relationship with your clients can be difficult – whether you’re just starting out as a professional coach or already have years of experience. Perhaps you’ve experienced the awkward situation of a client calling you at all hours, or you’ve wondered how to proceed when someone cries in your office. Alternatively, maybe you’ve found that interacting with your clients is smooth sailing but that winning them in the first place is an uphill climb.  If any of these difficulties sound familiar, don’t worry: Kim Morgan is here to help. Drawing on real-life case studies and decades of experience as a professional coach, she’ll show you the way out of the stickiest coaching situations. From managing your clients’ expectations to handling conflicts of interests, these blinks provide practical tips and tricks that will help you build your career as a respected coach in any area.  Along the way, you’ll learn  why you and your client need a contract; when to disclose personal information; and how you can regain a work-life balance. Leaving your old career and becoming a coach is an exciting transition. Take Simon, who previously worked in local government as a senior manager. Attracted by the high hourly rates he’d heard executive coaches command, he set his sights on coaching senior managers in corporate companies. But after completing his accreditation course, Simon hit a roadblock. Although he’d wanted to leave his old world behind, he found that the only coaching offers he received came from local government agencies. Why couldn’t he accelerate into the corporate fast lane as he’d planned?  The problem was that he lacked credibility.  Credibility can be an issue if you want to coach in an industry or sector you have not previously worked in yourself. After all, clients usually want coaches with professional knowledge of their particular area. However, with time and commitment, there are ways to boost your credibility in the line of work you’re interested in – even without prior experience.  How can you go about this?  Well, as part of your training to become a coach, you’ll probably be asked to conduct pro bono coaching sessions with clients. Unpaid work like this is a great way to start positioning yourself as a coach in your target area, and an opportunity to gain experience with the type of clients you aim to work with. Simon, for example, could offer voluntary coaching work to corporate managers in return for testimonials for his marketing materials. Alternatively, he could ask these non-paying clients for referrals to other potential customers in the corporate world.  You can also build your credibility by positioning yourself as an expert by way of personal rather than professional knowledge. Although Doreen planned to work as a Higher Education coach, she quickly realized that her experiences of later-life divorce, and subsequent online dating and remarriage, had inadvertently made her an expert on love too. Within her network of friends, her name was associated with relationships. People were already turning to her for advice. These days, Doreen is a practicing relationship coach and a great example of how personal experience can give a coach just as much credibility as professional know-how.  So, if you’re looking to build a credible coaching niche, take a look at your own biography for inspiration. What personal challenges stand out as things you can talk about with authority, or have helped you grow as a person? You just might be a credible coach in waiting. Sometimes it’s hard to know where the boundaries lie. Rachel is a warm and supportive coach, but there have been times when she’s overstepped the mark. In one session, for example, a client opened up about her miscarriage. As Rachel had also suffered a miscarriage, she promptly told the client this. Unfortunately, she could tell from the look on the other woman’s face that this information was unwelcome. This scenario begs the question: How much should coaches disclose about themselves during sessions? When it comes to self-disclosure, a good rule of thumb is to only share information for the benefit of your client, rather than for yourself. Humanist therapists, for example, believe that some self-disclosure is helpful. Why? Because by revealing that she too can be vulnerable and have unresolved problems, the therapist helps her clients realize that nobody’s perfect and that their shortcomings are nothing to be ashamed of. As a coach, you might say to a client that berates himself for getting anxious before public speaking that he shouldn’t be too hard on himself, and that you also get nervous when speaking publicly. By contrast, Rachel’s sharing of her miscarriage is a good example of unplanned self-disclosure which has little benefit for the client. In this case, the coach made a spontaneous admission when her client’s comments reminded her of a painful experience in her own past. Though this sort of disclosure may feel natural, it can easily set your coaching relationship off-balance. Not only does it remove focus from the client’s issues, but it can make your client feel as if she needs to start looking after you instead of vice versa.  Another issue related to boundaries is the question of what to do if your client starts crying in your session. Importantly, there’s a right and a wrong way to handle this.  Rachel handled it the wrong way. When a client began crying, Rachel stood up and embraced her in a hug. This wasn’t welcome. Instead of invading her client’s personal space, a better approach would have been to remain still, keep listening, and calmly wait for the client to proceed. It’s not unusual for coaching sessions to release pent-up emotions that cause tears. It’s your job to show your clients that they’re in a safe environment, where they can express strong emotions without interference. The author believes Lauren is a competent coach who always helps clients tackle their challenges. Unfortunately, Lauren doesn’t agree with this assessment. In fact, although she’s been qualified for three years, she has only had a handful of paying clients. Why? It’s because whenever someone tries to engage her services, Lauren redirects them to another coach in her network – to someone she believes would be more qualified to meet their needs. If you haven’t guessed by now, Lauren suffers from imposter syndrome.  This involves feeling like an unworthy imposter in one’s profession, and it might make Lauren feel better to know she’s far from the only one suffering from this debilitating condition.  The phenomenon was first outlined by clinical psychologists in the 1970s to describe feelings that were prevalent in professional women. In recent decades, however, it’s been estimated that around 70 percent of women and men will experience imposter syndrome during their professional lives. Those suffering from it often put a huge amount of effort into their work to make up for their own sense of inadequacy. Ironically, this often results in greater success, which then leads to even stronger feelings of being a fraud.  If you’re a coach suffering from imposter syndrome, you may live in constant fear that others are going to find out how incompetent you are. You might believe your success is due to good luck and, like Lauren, think your clients would be better off with another coach instead.  So, how can you combat these feelings of inadequacy? You can start by asking yourself where these feelings are really coming from. If you’ve struggled with feelings of low self-worth throughout your life, then your imposter syndrome may have its roots in your childhood experiences. In this case, it’s worth seeking professional help, either from a therapist or your coaching supervisor. Alternatively, if your sense of incompetence is limited to your new career as a coach, then it might help to remember that these feelings are common for people in your position. Consider the fact that many new coaches have previously worked in fields such as law, medicine or senior management. Professions like these require years of training and study to progress. If you’ve had a career like this, it can feel unsettling to make the jump into coaching, which requires far less prior training. The apparent ease of your transition can trigger feelings of being a fraud.  Just remember that it's not simply your accreditation course that makes you a coach. In fact, any experience you gather in your area of expertise adds to your competence. Luke was a freshly qualified coach excited to launch his new coaching business. Using his hard-earned savings, he splashed out on a slick website and took months designing his new branding. Upon completion, Luke got active on social media and spent the next year blogging about coaching and connecting with people on Twitter. Unfortunately, whilst Luke was making friends in the online world, his real-world business was suffering; during his first year, he won just two paying clients.  Where did Luke go wrong?  Like many new coaches, he mistakenly thought he could build his coaching business using online communication alone. The author has met many new coaches who, like Luke, focus entirely on slick branding and enticing social media profiles. But beware – this type of marketing tunnel vision is a risky approach. Although an online presence might make it seem as if you have a coaching business, the reality is that without customers, you don’t have any sort of business at all. Whilst there are successful businesses whose main marketing source is social media, they tend to have a highly targeted approach that focuses on converting people into customers. In contrast, coaches like Luke often focus on how many ‘likes’ their latest blog post or tweet has received, or how many times it’s been shared. Chasing likes and shares won’t help you become a better or more successful coach. So what should Luke have done differently? Well, despite advances in technology, there’s often no substitute for getting out into the real world and meeting potential clients.  If you’re new to the coaching business, it’s a good idea to get involved with networking groups, set up meetings with individuals or businesses who may become your clients, or arrange to give presentations to audiences that might contain potential customers. As you might have gathered, all these activities mean actually speaking to others about your coaching – something you can’t afford to avoid. Although it’s quite normal to find the idea of ‘selling’ your coaching uncomfortable, this discomfort is something you’ll need to deal with if you’re to become successful. So when it comes to developing your coaching business, be persistent – and don’t be afraid of the offline world. Hailey encountered some tricky situations during her first two years of coaching. First, there was the client who wouldn’t stop calling her for advice between sessions. Then there was the client who kept missing his appointments but seemed surprised that he’d still have to pay if he didn’t show up. Why, Hailey wondered, did things keep going wrong? The answer was simple: she hadn’t set up a contract with her clients.  Before you begin coaching a client, it’s crucial to discuss and sign a contract with her.  The International Coach Federation, for example, includes contracting as a key competency for coaches, and their members are obligated to give clients written contracts. Signing a contract with your client lays the foundation of your future relationship and clarifies what you expect from one another. A typical contract should cover issues like fees and cancellations, as well as contact outside of sessions. If Hailey had put contracts in place, then her first client wouldn’t have assumed she could call her whenever she wanted and her second client would’ve expected to pay for sessions that he failed to attend. Other aspects of the coach-client relationship covered by the contract are topics like confidentiality, potential conflicts of interest and the outcomes the client expects from the coaching.  Although this all might seem simple enough, many coaches don’t feel comfortable drawing up contracts with their clients. Hailey thought that beginning the coaching relationship on such a formal note would damage the warm rapport she’d already developed with her clients. She also worried that a written contract might undermine the spirit of trust in the sessions.  But in fact, a contract is the key to a great relationship with your clients. Not convinced? Then just consider that some of your clients might be new to coaching, and may not know much about how it works. This lack of knowledge can leave them feeling vulnerable and uncertain about your sessions together. Therefore, having a contract in place, with a clear outline of the coaching process, can manage their expectations while giving them some much-needed emotional security. As a coach, it can be hard to know where your loyalties should lie. Jason was being paid by a corporate company to coach a member of staff. Unfortunately, as their coaching sessions went on it became clear to Jason that the company was trying to get rid of this employee. Not only did the person report that he had been demoted, but most of his work had been taken away from him and his desk had been moved away from other employees. More worrying still, the employee seemed oblivious to his worsening situation.  What should Jason do?  His scenario describes a typical dilemma that many coaches face: If you’re being paid by a company to coach one of their people, then who is your client? The individual or the wider organization?  Unfortunately for Jason, there are no easy answers. The author believes that both of these parties are clients and that a good coach will do his best for both the individual and the company. After all, while Jason might have a personal connection with the person he’s coaching, he also has a business relationship with the organization.  This joint commitment to both parties shouldn’t be an issue, until you stumble into a conflict of interest, as Jason has. In this situation, a problem has arisen because the organization and the employee seem to want different outcomes from his coaching. As Jason sees it, the employee wants to use the sessions to build his confidence and gain more recognition in his workplace, whereas the company is hoping the employee will realize he should look for another job.  If you find yourself in Jason’s situation, you have two options.  Firstly, you could continue to coach the employee, but with the goal of raising his awareness of what’s really going on. You can do this by asking the right questions and undertaking exercises that shift his perspective on the situation. You could, for instance, ask what he thinks his boss’s opinion of him is. Alternatively, you could take a more passive approach by ignoring your hunch and continuing the sessions as before. After all, you’re not the client’s personal advisor and neither are you responsible for his employment status. If you’re leaning towards the latter approach, though, it’s a good idea to check in with your coaching supervisor for advice and to read up on your code of conduct for further guidance. Coaching can take over your life. Sam is a successful coach who specializes in helping unemployed women find new careers. Moreover, she’s so beloved by her clients that years after their coaching sessions have ended, they still email and phone to let her know how they’re getting on. Sadly, there’s a downside to Sam’s success story; these days, she’s spending so long keeping in touch with old clients that her life outside of work is disintegrating.  Sam is failing to look after herself. And she’s not the only one. Like many people who work in the ‘caring’ professions, coaches are often so focused on the needs of their clients that they neglect to look after their own wellbeing. The author, for example, has worked with coaches who spend entire coaching sessions in discomfort, simply because they need to go to the bathroom. Instead of excusing themselves, they remain in their chairs, unwilling to prioritize their own needs for even a brief moment. Unfortunately, constantly subordinating your needs to those of your clients is unlikely to do either of you any favors in the long run. Sam, for example, has begun resenting her old clients due to the amount of time she spends staying in touch with them. And once resentment creeps in, it’s only a matter of time before doubt sets in too. Just look at Diana – another successful coach who works with senior executives. Recently, she’s taken on more clients and begun working very long days. Overburdened and stressed, she’s started to view her clients as privileged people who complain about small things. Unsurprisingly, she’s beginning to wonder whether her future lies in coaching.  So, how can you keep your work-life balance on track and ensure you don’t fall into Sam and Diana’s pattern of overwork and resentment?  Interestingly, the answer may lie in your self-esteem. One of the reasons people end up working so hard is because they derive all their self-esteem from their professional successes. This can become so extreme that they feel useless when they’re not at work. As a result, they put in more hours, eventually ending up in situations like Diana. If you find yourself feeling like this, the solution is to explore other activities that boost your self-worth. You could focus on developing hobbies you’re proud of, for example, or concentrate on broadening your social circle and making new friends.  It’s important that coaching remains a significant part of your life instead of your whole life. By maintaining a work-life balance you can build better relationships with your clients – on your own terms. The key message in these blinks: New coaches face many challenges, from imposter syndrome to burn out, but most of these can be overcome with the right attitude. From conflicts of interest to setting appropriate client boundaries, an approach that emphasizes clear expectations and self-care can help you succeed in your new career. It’s not easy, but the rewards of becoming a successful coach, and helping your clients are huge.  Actionable advice: Motivate yourself to get fit.  It’s particularly important for coaches to look after their physical health. Why? Because coaching is, for the vast majority of us, a very sedentary job. When you’re not sitting and talking to a client, you’ll likely be at your desk hunched over a computer screen or driving to your next session. If you’d like to take better care of your body but are struggling to find the motivation, then simply reflect on how you might look and feel in several years if you fail to make the necessary changes.

If you were lucky, this person not only taught you the skills you needed to perform a particular task, but also empowered you to be the best you could be. Such coaches are unfortunately rare in life. In fact, a majority of employees say that coaching hasn’t helped them at work at all. If you’re a manager, how do you make sure that your coaching moments are effective? First, you need to realize that coaching is not about you – but about the employee. These blinks offer a clear guide to mastering the right questions and habits to becoming a coach who listens well and guides employees to greatness. In these blinks, you’ll also learn how to kickstart a coaching session; how asking a “lazy” question will help productivity; and why your brain is your biggest enemy in slaying old habits. Most managers have attended a coaching seminar or two. Unfortunately, only 23 percent of employees report that coaching sessions have had a positive effect on work performance. How can this be the case? How can we make coaching better? Let’s start by looking at some common problems in the workplace that make it far too easy for team members and leaders to fall into unproductive work habits: Your team refers all decisions, big and small, to you. They lose motivation, feel no agency, and you become the bottleneck of every project. You’re overwhelmed at work. You run from meeting to meeting, checking emails on the go. If an employee has an urgent question, they need to find you first. Your team is dedicated to completing work tasks, but you’re unsure which tasks are important and which make little difference. As a leader, if you find yourself in one of these unproductive work dynamics, how do you make a change? The key is to develop a coaching habit. Aim to coach your employees for ten minutes every day in an informal setting, rather than scheduling rigid weekly coaching sessions. Coaching should be a regular part of life in the office; you should always be in “coaching” mode. A coaching habit helps you guide your employees toward self-sufficiency. It prevents you from being buried by work and reconnects you and your team to the work that matters most. So focus on development, not performance. Performance is important, but you won’t empower your team if you’re constantly putting out small fires and forgetting the larger goals. Look for areas in which an employee can grow. Guide your team to becoming better and more effective at what they do as a group. A lot of managers “coach” by feigning interest and nodding meaningfully as an employee talks. Such behavior isn’t productive for either side. To coach effectively, begin with the Kickstart question. The Kickstart question is an essential tool in your coaching toolbox, and simply involves asking: “What’s on your mind?” Moreover, if you find yourself in a 20-minute discussion about the weekend with an employee you’re looking to coach, asking the Kickstart question will get you back on track. After you’ve listened carefully to what your employee has to say, move to the AWE question: “And what else?” The AWE question prevents a conversation from becoming stuck on a single topic when it’s clear there’s more the employee wants to say, but perhaps can’t find a way. Asking the AWE question is handy if you find yourself wanting to make a comment, too. As a coach, remember that you have to listen more than speak or offer advice. Your goal is to empower your employees, letting them come to their own conclusions. The worst thing for a leader is a group of employees who run to them every time a decision needs to be made. In cases where the first two questions in your coaching talk aren’t leading to a productive conversation, consider using the Focus question: “What’s the real challenge here for you?” When an employee starts to lose his train of thought or if you’re having a hard time following, that’s a good time to pop the Focus question. While an employee might want to vent about problems with a certain project, for instance, it won’t solve anything. The Focus question helps you narrow down the problem so you can tackle it together. In short, it helps you determine which challenge you need to work on first. The three coaching questions – Kickstart, AWE and Focus – are the foundation of your coaching practice. Let’s look at a further four questions which will launch you from basic coach to professional coach. It’s not always easy to identify what you need to do at work every day. Similarly, how can you coach an employee if she doesn’t even know why she’s speaking with you? An effective coach knows how to determine an employee’s needs in any given situation. People are always driven by wants or needs and asking the Foundation question can help when a conversation starts going in circles. Use the Foundation question “What do you want?” to get to the heart of the matter. Scientists say that people are driven by nine major wants and needs: affection, creation, recreation, freedom, identity, understanding, participation, protection and subsistence. The Foundation question helps you figure out which of these wants or needs is motivating your employee. Does your employee want you to understand that they need to get home early? Do they want to participate in a project more? Do they need more freedom to explore an idea? Another important tool in ascertaining the needs and wants of an employee is the Lazy question. Ask the question “How can I help you?” when an employee has nothing to offer but complaints about a situation. The Lazy question sets up a positive coaching moment. Asking this question helps you check if an employee is asking you for something or just wants to let off steam. It also clarifies the issue by pushing your employee to get to the point. While it’s a direct question, it also will help you earn your employee’s respect. When you ask the Lazy question, you show your employee that you want to know what they want. Understanding an employee’s wants will set you apart from many other managers who just don’t care. Do you often jump at an opportunity without assessing the situation thoroughly? Here’s a couple of tips and key questions to help you better gauge the risks and benefits of any opportunity. In short, it’s unwise to say “yes” to every single opportunity that comes your way. To ensure you give yourself time to think clearly, ask yourself the Strategic question: “If you’re saying ‘yes’ to this, what are you saying ‘no’ to?” When you take on something new, you drop something else. Yet you shouldn’t waste resources or neglect important projects. Use the Strategic question when you need to focus your energy on the projects that matter to you and the company. Focus your decisions by identifying the projects, people or habits you’ll have to change or abandon if you take on a new task. Consider that some tasks require you to hire new personnel or develop completely new organizational or working methods. Whenever you say “yes” or “no” to a project, make sure you understand the reason why. Here’s a tip: never respond to a request right away. Get as much information as you can before you make a commitment. Ask yourself: What will this new opportunity demand of you? What’s the deadline? How much time will it take? What’s the reason for it? What else needs to be accomplished before it can be finished? In addition to strategizing effectively, another important part of coaching is making room for employees to learn. This isn’t an easy task, as people don’t automatically internalize new information or quickly build new habits. In general, people learn when they’re able to reflect on new information or processes. Reflection is what makes a lesson “click.” To guide your employees toward that “click” moment, use the Learning question. At the end of every coaching session, ask your employee: “What was most useful for you?” Asking the Learning question helps to guide your employee to reflect on the session so he can keep building his skills and learning daily. This happens to every coach. You try to hold your tongue, but then, you accidentally blurt out a bit of advice. That’s not coaching! It’s parenting, or worse: it’s preaching. You now know that coaching is about questions, so how do you make sure your coaching practice stays about questions? A good coach knows how to ask questions. But spouting a series of questions can easily make an employee feel as if he’s being interviewed or even interrogated. As a coach, you don’t want to make your employees feel uncomfortable. So put an employee at ease by asking one question at a time. Don’t beat around the bush, however. Skip the small talk and cut to your first question; it saves both of you time. Ask “what” questions instead of “why” questions. Don’t make the employee feel like she needs to be on the defensive with a question like, “Why is that on your mind?” Ask instead, “What’s on your mind?” It’s also important to avoid asking rhetorical questions. Questions that start with, “Did you consider…?” or “Have you thought about…?” aren’t genuine questions – they’re advice with a question mark at the end! Make sure you listen to your employees, too. Don’t be afraid of silence. Silence tends to make people uncomfortable, but it’s an asset in coaching sessions. When you’re silent after you ask a question, you give your employee time to think about what she wants to say. And when an employee gives you an answer, nod or summarize her thoughts to show that you’ve understood. Doing so shows that you care and encourages the employee to share more. Finally, use every available channel to be a positive and effective coach. Perhaps your team members stay in touch via email or messaging software such as Slack. Remember that you’re still wearing your coaching hat when you communicate through these tools. Every interaction you have with employees is a coaching opportunity. Learning what to do and doing it are two different things. Let’s go over some ways you can stick to the tips you’ve learned by making them a habit in your coaching practice. It’s not easy to change behavior. In fact, according to a Duke University study, 45 percent of a person’s behavior stems from habit alone. And it’s difficult to change a habit if you don’t even think about it any more! To develop new habits, then, you need to put theory into practice. In recent years, neuroscientists and behavioral economists have gained insight into how humans develop and maintain habits. There are five events that need to occur for a habit to form: cause, trigger, mini-habit, training and an action plan. Let’s go through each event. A cause is the reason you want to change current behavior, like wanting to avoid giving advice, as it’s a hallmark of poor coaching. Once you know what you want to change, you identify your trigger – the moments that encourage you to offer advice. When you know your trigger, you’ll be prepared to deal with it. Your mini-habits are the seven coaching questions you’ve learned in these blinks. Practice them as often as possible. That’s your training! Finally, outline an action plan to fall back on when you slip up. Everyone makes mistakes, so you just need to figure out how to get back on track. Importantly, write down your action plan. Your plan could read, “The next time John stops me in the hallway with a question, I’ll ask a coaching question instead of giving advice.” Once you put theory into practice, you’ll develop a solid coaching habit that will stick with you for the rest of your life. Good luck – and happy coaching! The key message in this book: A good coach doesn’t just spout advice to a team. A good coach instead guides employees toward self-sufficiency in a positive, caring way. Use key coaching questions and truly listen to your employees to figure out what they need and want. Empower them daily so they can lead themselves.  Actionable advice: Create a coaching support group. Find other people who are looking to develop a coaching habit. Check in with each other often and share experiences and strategies. You’ll all benefit when you work together, and your employees will, too! Got feedback?

Despite their many differences, they all share this one habit in common: as soon as they wake up, they sit down for a cup of coffee.  Caffeine jolts the brain back into full consciousness while the evocative fragrance and taste of the beverage help people greet the day. This is the well-known power of coffee – and it’s all thanks to the humble little bean from which the drink is made.  But there’s a much more powerful, less widely known lesson hidden inside the coffee bean. The following story is a fable that conveys that lesson through vivid imagery, memorable metaphors and a story to which everyone can relate.  In these blinks, you’ll learn  how to escape feelings of hopelessness and resignation;  how to avoid becoming bitter and heartless; and  how to stay positive and overcome any form of adversity – all by harnessing the power of the coffee bean! The main character of our story is an adolescent named Abraham – or Abe, as people usually called him. Abe was your archetypical American teenage boy, right down to being a star player on the high school football team. He was in his senior year, with graduation beckoning on the horizon. His dream was to play football in college.  But Abe wasn’t just a jock; he also liked the academic side of school, especially science class, which was taught by his favorite teacher, Mr. Jackson.  From the outside, it seemed like everything was going alright for Abe. But one day, he came into his science class in a pretty foul mood, feeling hatred toward everything around him. Mr. Jackson noticed something was wrong and wanted to find out what was going on, so he asked Abe to stay after class.  In the private, heart-to-heart conversation that followed, Abe opened up to Mr. Jackson and let it all spill out. He was feeling a lot of stress and anxiety in both of the main areas of his life. At home, his parents were fighting, and the word “divorce” had even come up. At school, there were some upcoming exams, an essay assignment and a big Friday night football game looming over him.  The game was a particular point of pressure. Not only could a victory bring his team one step closer to reaching the state championship, but there would also be college scouts watching from the bleachers.  And then, on top of all that, there was the weight of other people’s expectations for a star player on the football team. If he played well, he felt under pressure to continue making people happy. If he didn’t play well, he felt the sting of their disappointment.  Do any of these things sound familiar? You don’t have to be an American high-school football player to relate to this story. Like Abe, you’ve probably encountered your fair share of family troubles and the equivalents of big games in your life, such as important presentations, meetings and interviews. At times, you’ve also probably found yourself feeling under too much pressure from too many sides at once – especially if you feel the weight of expectations that come with trying to be an exceptional parent, manager, coach or whatever role you might play in life.  How can we get through these challenging times and overcome these sources of stress? Well, Mr. Jackson has some surprising advice – not just for Abe but for all of us. After listening to Abe pour out his woes, Mr. Jackson simply nodded and said, “I know how you feel.” Then, he did something you might not expect. He didn’t dispense any words of wisdom or guidance. Instead, he gave Abe a homework assignment – and a rather random-seeming one at that: boil a carrot in a pot of water, observe it for a while, come back tomorrow and report what happened.  That night, Abe carried out the assignment, and the next day, he met with Mr. Jackson after class to share his observations. He’d found that after about ten minutes of being submerged in the boiling water, the carrot got soft.  Mr. Jackson then revealed the point of the assignment. The carrot, he explained, didn’t just get soft; it was softened by the boiling water, which was the environment in which Abe had put it. The water was a harsh environment, and it essentially weakened the carrot by putting it under stressful circumstances.  As Mr. Jackson went on to explain, the same thing can happen to all of us. When life gets difficult, we too find ourselves in hot water, so to speak. Applying this lesson to our own lives, we can see how our homes and workplaces can also turn into harsh environments, and our relationships and careers can put us under stressful circumstances of their own. If we let them overwhelm us with negative emotions like fear and hopelessness, we end up like the carrot – soft and weak.  Eventually, we may grow so exhausted and despondent that we want to give up on our struggles. For example, we might contemplate quitting a job that’s challenging us or running away from a relationship that’s on the rocks. Or we might become dispirited and withdrawn – no longer enjoying the things in which we used to take pleasure, or even shutting ourselves away from them. For instance, in the face of professional and financial setbacks, a dejected husband might lose his appreciation for his wife and children and might stop spending time with them.  According to Mr. Jackson, this carrot-like response to adversity isn’t the natural consequence of being overpowered by external forces. Instead, it’s the result of the misguided belief that those forces are more powerful than us.  To overcome our challenges, we have to change our mind-set – and that’s precisely what Mr. Jackson tried to get Abe to do with his next two lessons. So what’s the alternative to being a carrot? Just act tough and grit your teeth as the water boils you alive? Well, that’s not what Mr. Jackson would advise. On the contrary, his next lesson pointed out the fallacy of this approach to life. Once he got Abe to understand the moral of the carrot assignment and to see how it applied to his own troubles, Mr. Jackson asked a follow-up question: What would happen if you boiled an egg instead of a carrot?  Abe already knew the answer to this one, so he didn’t need to go home to find out: you’d end up with a hard-boiled egg. Mr. Jackson then elaborated his point. Even though they’re put in the same harsh environment and circumstances (boiling water), the carrot and the egg end up responding to it in opposite ways. The carrot gets soft; the egg gets hard.  As you may have suspected, this is yet another metaphor with a moral tucked inside of it. Like the egg, we too can harden when our environments and circumstances put us under stress. Indeed, there’s even a word for the emotional state that results from this process: “hard-hearted.” In this state, it’s as if our hearts have grown solid, no longer capable of letting love flow in or out. Instead, we start seething with anger and hatred toward the people in our lives.  In becoming like a hard-boiled egg, we’re essentially internalizing all the negativity we perceive in the world around us. It’s like we’re saying to everyone and everything around us, “Alright, so you’re going to be cold and mean to me? Then I’ll be cold and mean right back!”  Of course, in today’s world, there’s no shortage of negativity. Abe could attest to this. Like many of us, he tried to escape his troubles by scrolling through social media feeds and watching videos online. But there he found more negativity. If you’ve been online yourself recently, then you can easily imagine what he might have encountered: nasty comments, distressing news stories and hate-filled diatribes.  But Mr. Jackson would caution us from blaming the internet, adversity or any other external force for hardening us. It’s not really the forces themselves that harden us, he would argue; it’s our belief that they can harden us. Once again, what’s needed is a change of mind-set – and that was the subject of his next lesson to Abe. By the end of his second conversation with Mr. Jackson, Abe had learned two lessons: he didn’t want to be the carrot, and he didn’t want to be the egg – but what could he be instead?  Well, if you remember the title or introduction to these blinks, you already know the answer, so there’s no use trying to maintain the suspense: the answer is the coffee bean.  To help Abe understand the powerful alternative represented by this humble little bean, Mr. Jackson gave him another homework assignment: boil some coffee beans for about an hour, see what happens and report back tomorrow.  The next day, Abe was pretty excited to share his discovery with Mr. Jackson. It definitely took him by surprise. Perhaps it will be a revelation to you as well.  It turns out that if you boil some coffee beans for an hour, you end up with a pot full of coffee! Yes, coffee – as in the beverage you get when you run hot water through ground-up coffee beans in a coffee-maker. Whole beans flavor the water in the same way as ground-up beans; it just takes them a longer time to work their magic.  The contrast with the carrot and the egg could hardly be stronger. As we know, when a carrot and an egg are placed in the harsh environment of boiling water, they react in opposite ways – the carrot getting soft, the egg getting hard. But while they react in opposite ways, there’s an underlying similarity between them: they both end up getting transformed by their environment.  But with coffee beans, the transformation goes the other way around; the environment ends up getting transformed by the beans! One moment, it’s water. An hour later, it’s coffee.  Of course, the lesson here isn’t really about coffee beans; it’s about us. We too have the ability to transform the environments and circumstances around us. In exercising this ability, we demonstrate that the power inside of us is greater than the power of the forces outside of us. And to tap into this power, Mr. Jackson would argue, we just have to know that we have it. His wisdom here could be boiled down into a single sentence: Know yourself as a coffee bean, and you too can transform the environment around you.  But what does that look like in practice? Well, Abe’s about to show us! After he finished his third conversation with Mr. Jackson, Abe was so inspired by the lesson of the coffee bean that he shared it with all of his football teammates. They were pretty jazzed too and went on to win the big game and reach the state championship.  They ended up winning that game as well – but Abe injured his knee after he fell to the ground while making a play that helped ensure the team’s victory. It was a serious injury, putting him on crutches and requiring surgery. For all he knew, his dream of playing college football might be dashed.  But, remembering the lesson of the coffee bean, Abe didn’t let that depress him. Instead, he used his downtime as an opportunity to put that lesson into action. With some other students at his school, he started a coffee bean club. Their mission? To transform the social environment of the school and the surrounding community.  How? Through good deeds and random acts of kindness, like reading books to young children, posting positive comments on social media and writing encouraging notes to students going through difficult times. By the end of the school year, the environment of the school was transformed. Negativity was no longer considered cool; everyone wanted to be a coffee bean now.  From here, we’ll fast-forward a bit through the next parts of Abe’s story: his injury healed, he graduated from high school and went on to realize his dream of playing college football – at a military academy. Upon graduating from the academy, he became an army officer who would go on to lead multiple platoons in war zones. After five years of service, he retired from the military and returned to his home town, where he married his high school sweetheart, had three kids, became a volunteer coach for his alma mater’s football team and got an office job in sales.  Wherever he went, Abe carried coffee beans with him and shared Mr. Jackson’s lesson with everyone he encountered. Cadets, soldiers, high-school football players and white-collar office workers alike were inspired by its message. The message certainly had a broad appeal; after all, it told people that everyone has the power to transform any environment or circumstance around them.  But wait – any environment or circumstance? What about those involving really large forces beyond our control? At his sales job, Abe would be confronted by this ultimate question. Abe worked as hard as he could at his sales job, but it seemed to be no use. No matter how much he poured himself into it, his sales numbers kept going down.  But it wasn’t just Abe who was floundering. His coworkers and his company as a whole were in the same trouble. Week after week, they kept failing to reach their sales goals and revenue targets. The market was tough, and there were major macroeconomic and technological changes happening in their industry. As a result, they were being squeezed by external forces beyond their control.  With his job in jeopardy, a wife and three kids to support, and a mortgage, two cars, healthcare bills and credit card debts to pay off, Abe was getting increasingly anxious and stressed about his ability to make ends meet.  Festering with these negative emotions, he started seeing his wife and children more as burdens than gifts, and he began to withdraw from his partner. When she tried to talk to him about his difficulties, he’d walk out of the room. In other words, part of him was turning into an egg.  He also started thinking about giving up. He contemplated quitting his job and finding a new one, rejoining the military or even running away from his life and starting all over again. Another part of him was turning into a carrot.  But then, one cold winter day, while he was drinking his morning coffee and thinking these carrot-like thoughts, he looked down into his mug and felt the warmth of the hot beverage below. At that moment, he remembered Mr. Jackson’s lesson of the coffee bean, which he’d forgotten about amid all the stress in his life.  Inspired by the lesson all over again, Abe went back to work and rolled up his sleeves. Rather than feeling sorry for himself, he focused on developing new relationships and opportunities for his company. His sales numbers turned around, and he got promoted all the way up to head of sales and marketing.  Under Abe’s leadership, the company regained its footing by streamlining its operations, adopting innovative ideas and technologies, and adding new products and services to its lineup. The surrounding economic conditions remained challenging – but instead of viewing them with fear, regret or resignation, the company embraced them as an opportunity to evolve.  Here, we’ll leave Abe in his moment of triumph and draw two final lessons from his story. As a high school senior, Abe was a mixture of a carrot and an egg who became a coffee bean, metaphorically speaking. But then, at his sales job, he reversed back into his carrot and egg-like ways. Fortunately, he was then able to transform himself into a coffee bean once again, saving his company and becoming head of sales and marketing in the process.  There’s an important lesson to be learned from all of these reversals: the choice between being a carrot, an egg or a coffee bean isn’t something we do once and then are done with it – locked into our choice forever, for better or worse. No – we make the choice over and over again with each new situation we face.  This fact should fill us with caution because it means we can stop being a coffee bean if we forget to make the choice to be one. But it should also make us hopeful because it means we can become a coffee bean again, even if we’ve chosen to be a carrot or an egg. The power to be a coffee bean always remains inside of us; we have to remember that we have it!  There’s one more lesson to be learned from Abe’s transformation into a coffee bean. To see it, remember two of the main episodes in which he pulled it off: as leader of the coffee bean club in high school and as head of sales and marketing at his company. In both cases, Abe didn’t become a coffee bean by himself; he inspired others to join him, and they worked together to transform their environments.  In other words, it’s not just individuals who can be carrots, eggs or coffee beans in the face of difficulties. Entire organizations make the same choice as they navigate the broader challenges of the world. Indeed, the same could be said of society as a whole. We can imagine an ideal world in which everyone worked together to transform their environment and circumstances for the better. Maybe that’s what Abe had in mind in the final chapter of his story. After helping to rescue his company, he decided that his mission in life was to spread the message of the coffee bean lesson to as many people as possible. To that end, he traveled the world, giving motivational speeches in a wide range of settings – from schools and hospitals to businesses and nonprofits.  Stories of transformation followed in his wake, as people realized their inner potential to change their environments.  Perhaps the next story of transformation will be a story about you! The key message in these blinks: There are three basic responses in the face of adversity. We can represent each of them with the way an object reacts to being placed in boiling water, which is a metaphor for being surrounded by difficult environments or circumstances. The first response is to act like a carrot – growing soft and weak with emotions like fear and hopelessness. The second is to act like an egg – growing hard-hearted. The third is to act like a coffee bean – transforming the environment or circumstances around us and making the most of them.  Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

He practiced and wrote so much, in fact, that he deformed his fingers! Creativity is like that. It’s a muscle you have to keep in shape through practice and, in order to do so, you have to know what exercises keep creativity strong. Once it’s fit, you’ll be able to take what’s in your mind and share it with the world. These blinks help you develop your creativity by showing how you can improve skills through repetition and discipline; discipline then becomes routine; and routine becomes habit. In these blinks, you’ll find out the not-so-secret guiding force that makes Moby Dick such a great novel; why even Shakespeare wasn’t totally original; and how to keep notes like Beethoven.   This is a Blinkist staff pick “I’ve never forgotten these blinks’ tips on creativity. I even used a system similar to the box of index cards mentioned in the third blink when working on a freelance project.” – Ben S, Audio Lead at Blinkist The first step toward harnessing your creativity is recognizing the unique perspective that’s hardwired in everyone. This perspective is your creative identity, and familiarity with it will help you find your passions, interests and true creative talent. The better you know yourself, the more discernible your strengths and weaknesses will become. For example, during an improvisation session, the author asked an art student to describe a dance as a color. After much aimless blabber, the student finally said “limpid blue.” Clearly, his creative identity was more writerly than painterly. Your creative identity can also be seen in the patterns of your own experiences. Try writing down your ambitions; your successes and failures; your ideals, role models and the first creative ideas you can remember. What patterns do you see? Your identity also reflects the way you see the world and your unique way of working. If you can figure out who you are, then you’ll better know how to approach your goals. For example, having been a dancer, and now being a choreographer, the author has an understanding of both the minute technical details involved in a dance and the audience’s viewpoint. This allows her to step in close and see whether her dancers and producers are acceptable and committed, then to step back and look at her work from the vantage of the audience. Another way to understand your identity is to ask yourself, “If I could change my name, what would it be? And why?” Plenty of people change their names for one reason or another. Cassius Clay, for instance, became Muhammad Ali after converting to Islam. What does your new name say about who you want to be and what you want to do? Feeling secure in your identity and talent will make your work much easier and more enjoyable. The following blinks will explore how habits and routines are the foundation of creative work. It’s not easy starting a new project. One way to make it easier, though, is establishing routines and rituals. Establishing rituals requires commitment to a daily activity until you engage in that activity without thinking about it. Eventually, the familiar comfort of your ritual will make you feel confident and self-reliant. Igor Stravinsky’s morning ritual was playing a Bach fugue. The author’s businessman friend folds out a dollar bill at the start of each deal and stares at the motto “Annuit coeptis,” Latin for “Providence has favored our undertakings.”   The author herself gets up at dawn each morning, has a coffee and takes a cab to the gym for her morning workout. One simple habit could be to carry a tool of your trade at all times. This could be anything – a pen, a camera, a dictaphone. Another good habit is to quickly and effectively confront your anxieties. It’s good to arm yourself with some retorts to the cruelties that our minds can sometimes fling at us. For example, when you think, “People will laugh at me,” you can respond with, “But not those who respect me.” “It’s been done before,” you tell yourself, but then respond with, “Even Shakespeare wasn’t totally original.” Or if you think, “The idea won’t be as good as it is in my mind,” then simply respond with, “Errors happen.” Get in the habit of exercising your memory regularly, as it sharpens your imagination, vocabulary and ability to retrieve ideas. A good memory also gives you authority and credibility in a group setting. In a lecture or business meeting, for example, remembering a salient fact garners respect and attention. The author exercises her memory during rehearsals by memorizing the first 12 to 14 notes – feedback, comments, possible changes – without writing them down. She then categorizes them in her mind and ticks them off with her fingers. The best organization system is a simple one. That’s why the author begins each new project with an inexpensive yet sturdy cardboard filing box. She labels it and writes down her major goals on index cards. She then fills the box with the materials and inspiring objects that accrue as the project progresses. The box represents commitment. It’s a way of documenting progress and of feeling connected to the project. Whenever you feel lost or uncertain, take a look inside the box. It should make you feel organized and anchored to your original inspirations and goals. Even if the project is delayed, you will be secure in the knowledge that the box still contains the work you’ve done thus far. You can always open it up and pick up where you left off. Of course, you don’t have to use boxes. You can use anything, as long as it’s simple and easy to store, retrieve and move. For example, it could be as simple as a system of drawers filled with your sketches, notes and reference materials. Or it could be one big drawer. It could even be an organized filing system on your computer. Whatever you use, remember that filling it is the preparation for your creative work, not the work itself. Think of it as the research material that journalists collect for a story. It was this kind of organization, for instance, that made Beethoven such a prolific composer. He kept many notebooks filled with ideas. When he had a new idea, he’d jot it down in a notebook. Then he’d develop it in a separate notebook, let it rest a few months, and further develop it in a third notebook, until the rough idea became a piano sonata. Habits and routines are the foundation for creative work. Now you’ll need some inspiring ideas to put the gears in motion. Looking for ideas to fill your box is like scratching a lottery ticket: you never know what you’ll get, nor exactly what you’re looking for! The important thing, however, is to scratch away and see what fortune brings you. You can think of everyone and everything in your life as being equally “scratchable,” in the sense that they may reveal information and inspiration that’ll point you in the right direction. A good way to start scratching for ideas is through improvisation. Try new things and follow your impulses until you stumble upon something interesting. Worry about the consequences later! This is exactly what a painter does when she draws a series of sketches, or a choreographer when he tests some new moves. Really, you can scratch anywhere. Read regularly to uncover ideas and to exercise your imagination. Find inspiration in everyday conversations and situations, in other people's work or in nature. And make time to take field trips. For example, you can go to a police station to observe people under pressure, or to a hospital to observe chaos and extreme human emotions. But be sure to take your time along the way. Start scratching for a little idea first, not your magnum opus, and then develop it gradually into a bigger one. For example, if you want to write a dance number, a little idea might be a dance to the song “Uptown Girl,” which can later be developed into a big idea like a Broadway show based on the music of Billy Joel. Of course, not everything you’ve found by scratching should go in your box. You want to keep the good ideas, i.e., the ones that immediately lead to other ideas, and discard the bad ones that simply place limitations on your creativity. Although organization and planning are important for all creatives, you don’t want to overdo it. Creativity is also about letting go of your plans and playing the hand you’ve been dealt. Trying to create the perfect conditions for your project can leave you stalled on the starting line. Often, perseverance in the face of adverse conditions often yields better results. A writer working against a tight deadline, for example, will write with a newfound urgency and passion. Faced with unlimited time, however, that same writer may never deliver. Necessity truly is the mother of invention. The author discovered this to be true in 1965, when she choreographed her first dance without any money, scenery, music or even a stage to work on. These severe limitations forced her to develop her own style and draw inspiration from within. This project turned out to be the first of many successes. Furthermore, the solution to your creative problems can come to you spontaneously or even accidentally, making perseverance that much more important. That’s what happened to Charles Goodyear in 1839, when, after years of experimentation, he finally stumbled upon the recipe for vulcanized rubber by accidentally spilling a concoction of gum and sulfur into a stove. But while “going with the flow” is important, there are ways to ensure you don’t hit a dead end. Sometimes that means choosing the right form for your project. If you can’t seem to finish your novel, turn it into a short story. Or if the characters’ depth is constrained by your page count, try extending your work into a novella. And sometimes you just have to scrap the project. The author once did a piece called “The Hollywood Kiss” purely as a favor to a composer, and after wasting six weeks of her time, she eventually realized that the project was going nowhere, despite meticulous planning, and decided to scrap it. But now that you’ve found your creative stride, how do you keep up momentum? Once you've scratched out an idea and developed it through research and preparation, the result is your project’s spine – your intentions; the story you want to tell; the image you want to explore. The spine isn’t necessarily the concept that you want to convey to your audience. Rather, it’s the intent that guides you from the beginning of your creative process to the end. It’s a tool that keeps you on track when you feel lost. For example, the spine of Herman Melville's Moby Dick is simple: get the whale. While not the message of the novel, getting the whale is what drives the story and its characters. Once you have your spine, assess your skill-set before getting into the specifics of your project. Which skills do you have that enable you to implement your spine? Obviously, the more skills in your arsenal, the more possibilities available to you. But it’s important to first master the basics. A head chef, for example, can chop onions better than anyone else in the kitchen. In the same vein, a successful entrepreneur can keep the books and make sales. Part of this mastery is learning by doing. The author learned this the hard way when she was working with a lighting designer who refused to turn off the lighting to allow her dancers to exit the stage, telling the author to do it herself. So she learned one of the most difficult skills of stage directing: how to have performers enter and exit the stage. But how do you know which skills you need to develop? Start by taking inventory of the skills required in your field. Then, imagine missing a crucial one. How would you compensate, and what could you accomplish? What does that say about your working habits and potential? Every creative has fallen on hard times at some point or another. They get writer’s block, have a sudden case of “two left feet” or just can’t seem to express themselves. One such struggle is being in a rut: everything is running like it should, but you don't feel you're making any progress. So where do these ruts come from? Sometimes they’re the result of a bad idea, poor timing or unfortunate circumstances. More often, however, ruts come from relying on old methods that aren’t adjusted for new circumstances. Think about it: a salesman’s tried-and-true sales pitch can suddenly become useless if it addresses a problem that customers no longer have. In the same vein, you have to continually develop your methods to keep them up to date. To get out of a rut, identify what’s not working, write down your assumptions about it and then challenge those assumptions by gathering new ideas. A good way to find these ideas is to set an aggressive ideas quota in order to unlock your intellectual agility and imagination by applying pressure. The author used this method when she asked her students to come up with 60 uses for a wooden stool. The first few ideas were always the most obvious – sitting, standing, burning it for fire, etc. But as they got closer to 60, the students stretched their imaginations to come up with the most interesting uses – a weapon, a surface for gymnastics, a lion-taming tool. You don’t even have to be in a rut to make use of these exercises. Challenging your assumptions periodically keeps your problem-solving skills sharp, and might help you avoid falling into a rut in the first place. Unfortunately, even with the most thorough planning, the most inspired spine and the best of luck, your creative project can still flop. But don’t be discouraged! Failures can actually be quite productive. Private failures, for example, are great. These are painless, productive failures that remain your little secret. These are things like the pitifully bad ideas you’ve discarded over the years, or the 3,000-word manuscript that only yielded three good sentences. Likewise, public failures can be productive, though often severely painful. It is precisely the pain that gives us motivation to change however. The bigger the flop, the smaller the chances that you'll make the same mistakes. In fact, sometimes public failure is the only thing that can rescue you from denial. For example, during the author’s Chicago previews of Movin’ Out, she knew there were still some rough areas, but hoped they were minor enough to be overlooked by the audience. But her critics panned it, calling the disastrous first act a “mess.” While failure is an important learning experience, it’s still important to fix what you can. That’s why you must continuously expand your skillset. The more skills you have in your toolbox, the more problems you can solve. After the preliminary runs of Movin’ Out, for instance, the author heavily reviewed and amended her directing and editing choices. As a result of these revisions, the show ran for three years after opening on Broadway, went on several tours, earned excellent reviews and the author even won a Tony award for best choreography. Failure isn’t fun, but it’s important. Forget the pain, but remember the lessons you’ve learned. The key message in this book: While talent and technical skill are important, they aren’t enough to make you a successful artist. Hard work, self-awareness, discipline and a habit of exercising your creative abilities are key to consistently achieving your creative goals. Actionable advice: Leave a little bit of fuel to go on tomorrow. At the end of your working session, make a note with your last ideas and read it before you start the next one. Hemingway had a similar method, always stopping his work when he knew what was coming next in order to have a bridge to the next day. Learn from your role models. There’s no need to reinvent the wheel. Trace your role models’ steps and travel in their paths. Try to acquire their skills before forging a path of your own. For instance, if you’re a writer, copy a text you admire to learn the process of choosing words and assembling sentences.

Even the most brilliant geniuses among us need a helping hand now and then to get their ideas off the ground. But pulling together to achieve a common aim isn’t as easy as it looks on paper. Whether it’s in the office or on the sports field, a dysfunctional group dynamic can quickly sour the atmosphere and lead to all manner of infighting. So what makes a team more than the sum of its parts? Drawing on evidence ranging from a study of kindergartners building a spaghetti tower, to the way today’s most successful companies run their workplaces, Daniel Coyle’s The Culture Code explores the importance of the way we interact with our teammates, while providing plenty of tips on how to avoid inadvertently throwing a wrench into the works. In these blinks, you’ll find out why a group of children can easily beat lawyers in a simple teamwork exercise; what makes us feel safe and why that matters; and why stories are so effective when it comes to establishing a shared sense of purpose. Whether it’s a family, a circle of friends or work colleagues, we’re all members of different groups. And big or small, every group has its own distinctive culture. So what’s a group culture? In essence, it’s the relationships between people working together to achieve a common aim. Not all group cultures are alike, though. Some work well, while others are dysfunctional. You can spot a poor group culture a mile off. If you’ve ever worked in an office or lived in a house with a defective group culture, you’ll know the atmosphere is so thick and tense that you could cut it with a knife. That’s often the result of group members focusing on the wrong thing. Rather than paying attention to the quality of their interactions, they struggle to determine their position within the group and spend time worrying about their own status. As soon as you start doing that, you’re no longer focused on the work at hand; everything becomes a question of whose ideas can be criticized and which rules are open for debate. That’s a recipe for disaster. Take a study carried out by engineer Peter Skillman. He asked groups of kindergartners, business school students and lawyers to take part in a simple competition. The aim of the exercise was to build the tallest possible structure using uncooked spaghetti, tape, a yard of string and a single marshmallow. If you were the betting type, you’d surely put your money on the students or lawyers, right? After all, they’re the ones with the most expertise, experience and general knowledge. As it turned out, it was the kindergartners who usually won. So how did they prevail over their older and presumably wiser competitors? The answer lies in group dynamics. The business school students, for example, always began by analyzing the task at hand, discussing the right strategy to follow and quietly establishing a hierarchy. The kindergartners pursued a radically different approach. Rather than trying to figure out who was responsible for what, they simply got on with the task. Hardly wasting a word, they huddled together and started experimenting. If one attempt failed, they tried something else. They ended up winning the competition because they were focused on interaction; they were cooperating to achieve a shared goal rather than competing amongst themselves. So how can you make your groups more like that of the kindergartners? In the following blinks, we’ll delve deeper into the question of group culture to find out. Imagine you’ve been assigned a complex task demanding every ounce of your skill and expertise. You’re given two choices as to where to work: your own home or a room full of complete strangers. In which setting would you be more likely to succeed? Most of us wouldn’t hesitate – of course, it’d be much easier in your own home, right? It’s a safe environment, and the same principle applies to groups. A group performs at a much higher level if each of its members feels safe. It’s worth thinking about the concept of safety a little. What is it and why is it so important? Safety is ultimately about a sense of familiarity and connections. When we feel safe, we know that there aren’t unseen dangers lurking around every corner. A strong group culture nurtures that sense, and that, in turn, boosts individual performance. Take a study conducted by Will Felps, an associate professor at the University of South Wales. Felps instructed a man called Nick to assume different roles among various groups that had been tasked with developing a marketing plan for a company. Taking on the guise of an obnoxious idler, Nick would slack off and obstruct the progress of the group’s work. In most cases, his behavior was contagious: those around him mirrored his attitude and started behaving in the same way. Only one group proved immune to this behavior. This was a group in which one of the members – Jonathan – consistently countered Nick’s bad attitude with warmth and positivity. By making those around him feel safe and comfortable, he helped the group perform well despite the presence of a “bad apple” among them. This finding underscores an important point: we perform best when we receive belonging cues that bolster our perceptions of safety. Further proof of this can be found in another study of group performance by professor Alex “Sandy” Pentland at the MIT Media Lab. Pentland had two groups of students play the roles of bosses and employees engaged in negotiations about salary, health benefits and vacations. Pentland then used a so-called sociometer – a data-collecting sensor programmed to pick up belonging cues like eye contact, mimicry and physical proximity – to analyze the negotiations. Paying attention to these cues allowed Pentland to gauge the sense of safety of the participants. Our brains are wired to be constantly alert and on the lookout for signs of danger, so these behavioral traits are a good indication of when we feel safe in our environment. Pentland discovered that he could predict the outcome of the bargaining sessions just by looking at the first five minutes of the data he had gathered. It was the interaction that determined the outcome, not what was being said. So we know that the success of groups depends on making everyone feel safe. But creating a safe environment isn’t something that can be picked up from a book. Like honing your soccer skills, it’s something that takes time and practice. That said, there are a few tips that might help you along the way. If you want to create a safe working environment, it’s essential that you let the people around you know that you’re listening to what they have to say. Take an insight developed by Ben Waber, the founder of the behavior consultancy firm Humanyze. Whenever he visits companies or organizations with a successful group culture, he invariably sees the same things. People show that they’re listening to each other; they tilt their heads toward the speaker, raise their eyebrows and hardly blink. They also use linguistic markers to show that they’re paying attention, interjecting words of affirmation like “uh-huh,” “right,” “yes” and so on. It’s a simple and effective way of making people feel safe. Try it out sometime! Interjecting occasionally to show you’re following someone’s train of thought isn’t the same as interrupting them, however. Great listeners know when to hold back. That’s important because interruptions disturb the smooth flow of interactions that foster a sense of belonging and safety. Waber also noticed this when he was looking at group dynamics. Salespeople who interrupted their potential buyers, for example, weren’t nearly as successful as those who spent more time listening to them. Another top tip is to let people see your weaknesses. Demonstrating that you’re aware of your own imperfections and admitting that you also make mistakes early on in an interaction lays a foundation for a feeling of safety. That’s not an easy thing to admit to, of course. Usually, we’re determined to dazzle others with our competence – but that just isn’t the best way to put others at ease. A much more effective strategy is to make others feel like you need their help. This can be as simple as using a phrase that invites input like “I might be wrong, of course,” “did I miss anything?” or asking someone what they think. So that’s the first key skill you need in order to create a safe environment. In the next blink, we’ll take a closer look at a second, essential strategy. Take a moment to think about how you interact with others. Have you ever exaggerated your own know-how and gone to great lengths to demonstrate your competence? If that sounds familiar, you should stop! While it might sound counterintuitive, sharing your vulnerabilities is essential to boosting group performance. But how does this work? Mirroring is a common dynamic in groups. We pick up on the way those around us behave and take up the same patterns. Admitting weaknesses and mistakes signals to other group members that they can do the same. That’s a great way to build trust. Jeff Polzer, a professor in organizational behavior at Harvard, calls this a vulnerability loop. This essentially refers to a feedback loop between the members of a group, which generates the sense of closeness essential to cohesive group performance. A dramatic example of this occurred during a plane crash in 1989. A domestic flight to Chicago piloted by Al Haynes suddenly ran into drastic problems when an engine exploded mid-flight. Haynes then made a decision that ended up saving just under 200 lives. Instead of trying to resolve the issue by himself, he told his colleagues that he needed their help. By admitting his vulnerability, he allowed the other crew members to also ask for help. Once they started doing that, they began working together to regain control of the plane. The plane eventually crashed and 100 people were killed, but there were also 185 survivors, which was something close to a miracle. When the incident was later recreated in simulations, it was impossible to achieve the same outcome – every simulated flight resulted in the deaths of all passengers and crew. This close connection between admitting vulnerabilities and cooperation has been confirmed by several other studies. Take an experiment conducted by psychology professor David DeSteno. The participants in the study were asked to complete a time-consuming and laborious task on a computer. As they neared completion of the task, the computers would suddenly – and seemingly spontaneously – crash. DeSteno had planted an assistant amongst the group. When the computers crashed, he would come to the rescue of the participants and restore the work they’d just lost. Later, while playing a specially designed game, the participants showed a much greater willingness to cooperate both with their rescuer and the other computer users, despite the fact that they remained complete strangers to one another. This was because they had experienced a moment of vulnerability and had then been “rescued,” a series of events that had resulted in a sense of trust and safety. So how do you go about building a strong team? A good place to start is to communicate your expectation that people should cooperate with each other. To say that you want to cooperate with someone is another way of saying that you need their help – which is also a way of sharing your vulnerabilities. When you let people know that you’re reliant on their help, it lets them know that they can also feel comfortable admitting their shortcomings. It creates an environment in which no one is expected to go it alone and manage everything by themselves. It’s a nifty trick that’s been put into action by Tim Brown, the head of the international innovation consultancy agency IDEO. At the start of each assignment, he’s explicit about the need for cooperation and tells his colleagues that the trickier the problem, the greater the need will be for the team to work together to develop solutions. That philosophy of cooperation is at the heart of IDEO’s success. That might leave you wondering about the role of leaders in all this. The answer is in the word itself: their task is to lead. And that means being the first to walk the plank and admit their vulnerabilities. You can see why this is so important by imagining an office meeting with both your colleagues and your managers. It’s unfortunately common for the former to “fear” the latter, as they’re worried about keeping up appearances and demonstrating their knowledge and competency. But it’s normal to make mistakes – we all make them! They’re a part of the learning process, which is why leaders need to be role models and lead the way. By admitting their vulnerabilities and imperfections, they help foster an open environment in which everyone can admit mistakes and work with others on solutions. Take the example of the successful American restaurateur Danny Meyer. The morning after he’d given a TED Talk, he held a staff meeting and watched the footage of the talk with his employees. After they’d seen the video, Meyer asked them for their feedback and shared his experiences. He told them how nervous he’d been, how much his legs had been shaking and how badly he’d messed up the rehearsal. Finally, he thanked two colleagues and told them that he wouldn’t have been able to give the talk at all without their help. This is a great way to lead by example. By sharing his vulnerabilities in such a candid manner, Meyer created a working environment in which every employee felt free to do the same. If you’ve ever played or even just watched a team sport like soccer or basketball, you’ll know that the teams that regularly put in a great performance share a strong vision of how to play together and what they want to achieve. That’s because a common sense of purpose is key to group performance. Let’s pause for a second to define that. A sense of purpose is simply a set of beliefs and values underpinning people’s actions. It’s what shapes a group’s identity and tells others what it stands for. Cooperative cultures can’t do without it. A shared sense of purpose provides group members with a common stock of ideas and aligns their behavior. Because a shared sense of purpose is so important to group cohesion and performance, companies often try to create high-purpose environments. This is a way of guiding action around a repeatable purpose that’s always at the front of group members’ minds. High-purpose environments are packed with signals connecting members of the group to a shared future goal. Think of it like a bridge spanning the present and the future. Before setting foot on the bridge, the members of the group are confronted with a sign saying, “This is where we are today, and this is where we’ll be tomorrow!” Psychology professor Gabriele Oettingen has demonstrated in several studies that communicating common goals, like “Customer safety is our first priority,” helps unite the members of a group while making their shared aim accessible. “Bridges” are like stories with a distinctive narrative arc. This is an important factor because our minds are highly receptive to storytelling, and data from brain scans consistently proves it. When we’re confronted with a simple fact, our brains are fairly inactive; at most, we grasp the meaning of the fact. Stories, on the other hand, actively engage our minds – we can’t help but start thinking about cause and effect as well as the greater meaning of the story. That makes storytelling a powerful spur to action. It motivates us to pursue a common goal like, for example, putting customer safety first. Establishing a sense of purpose isn’t something you can do overnight; it’s not as simple as carving a mission statement into a block of granite and putting it outside the company headquarters. So take your time, as it’s a process that involves failures and learning from past mistakes. Even so, there are a few tips that can help you along the way. Repetition is integral to a shared sense of purpose. And repetition really does mean repetition. You should be blue in the face once you’re done extolling your company’s core convictions! Because we know what we mean when we say something, we often assume that our priorities have been communicated to others – but they’re often about as clear as mud. That’s why you shouldn’t be shy about repeating yourself; if you want something to be clear, say it ten times over. To get a sense of why this is so important, take a survey by Inc. magazine that asked managers how many people in their firms knew what the company’s top priorities were. The average among the executives’ answers was 64 percent. When the magazine asked the employees, however, it soon became clear that the actual number was only 2 percent! A clever way of boosting awareness is by overcommunicating your company’s sense of purpose in regular meetings. This is especially effective when you invite people to actively engage and encourage them to reflect on and even challenge the company’s goals. That’s something that the American healthcare company Johnson & Johnson does to great effect. They hold frequent meetings with senior managers designed to encourage robust discussion of the company’s credo – conveniently enough, it’s also carved in granite just outside the building where the meetings take place. Johnson & Johnson’s core aims haven’t changed much as a result, but it does encourage active engagement with their priorities. Another effective way of establishing a common sense of purpose is to use short and snappy catchphrases. These can be corny, of course, but that doesn’t mean that they’re not effective. Think, for example, of online shoe and clothing company Zappos’s memorable slogan “Create fun and a little weirdness,” or consulting firm IDEO’s “Talk less, do more.” Cheesy or not, they’re useful reminders of what a company stands for. So embrace them! The key message in this book: Group dynamics determine outcomes. When a team focuses its attention on the wrong thing, it loses sight of what’s most important to its performance – the interactions of its members. But a healthy and productive group dynamic is possible. The best way of achieving it is to create a safe environment in which everyone can share their vulnerabilities. When you add a common sense of purpose into the mix, you’ve got the perfect recipe for success! Actionable advice: Learn how to be a great listener. Whether it’s your family, local soccer team or workplace, chances are that you’re part of at least one group. So how do you go about contributing to its success? Your individual performance is essential, of course – but you shouldn’t forget about working to create a healthy group dynamic. Openness and attention to detail are key, which means not only listening to what other members have to say but also showing that you’re listening. And when it’s your turn to speak your mind, make sure to invite others to participate and share their feedback. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Chris Edmonds","summary":"Nowadays, culture has become a mystical and elusive ideal for all organizations. Fix your culture and all will turn to gold! Of course, you can’t just snap your fingers and overhaul your organization’s culture from one moment to the next, but when you consider companies like Zappos, it’s clearly a goal worth pursuing. After all, Amazon paid big bucks for Zappos, and it’s no secret that part of what they were buying was Zappos’s unique culture. As you’ll see in these blinks, research backs up the importance of organizational culture: Great company culture helps companies last longer and be more successful. It makes for more engaged employees, more loyal customers and more creative offices. So how do you start transforming your culture? Read these blinks to find out. In these blinks, you’ll learn why Zappos pays new hires to quit; how a mission statement can help you outlast your competitors; and a five-step method for addressing people who resist the new culture. Want to revolutionize your work culture and transform your business? Start by writing an organizational constitution – a formal document that sets out the core principles of your company or team. Here’s how it works: Organizational constitutions lay out specific rights for employees and standards for them to follow. Think of it like the rules of the road, guidelines you use to navigate an ambiguous situation and govern your behavior. For instance, when arguing with a colleague, it’s easy to go too far and insult them. But if your organizational constitution includes a zero-tolerance policy for rude conduct between co-workers, you would likely choose your words more carefully. But an organizational constitution should also answer important questions: What are our company goals? What performance targets can help us meet them? And what are our standards for how we treat each other? For example, when Tony Hsieh founded the online shoe store Zappos, his intention was for the company to have a fun, familial atmosphere. To facilitate this, he defined ten values that would form the basis of the company culture. Here’s why an organizational constitution is essential for your business: Without an agreement to guide it, your company will struggle to develop a good work culture, and your organization’s culture has a huge impact on its success. Take Zappos’ renowned customer service. Since Zappos’ employees like their jobs, they’re full of enthusiasm, which they then pass on to their customers. The customers then associate this enthusiasm with Zappos, which is a big plus for the company. In fact, Amazon cited Zappos’ great office culture as a major incentive for purchasing the company in 2009. Zappos owes their culture to their constitution, because when there’s a formal agreement governing how people are treated, everyone feels safe, respected and engaged with their work. And engaged employees are better employees: a 2013 Gallup study found that engaged workers are more productive, with less turnover, fewer accidents and better customer satisfaction. When designing the rules that’ll govern your organization, it’s important to first decide the values you’ll hold yourself to. Inspiring a culture as revolutionary as Zappos’s also means looking at your own capabilities. Remember, as a leader, all eyes are on you. You need to be a living example of the rules that guide your company and its culture. Everything the person in charge does affects the team culture for better or worse. How? Well, if your behavior varies, or if you contradict the organizational constitution, your employees might think that you’re not truly invested in changing the culture, and that your shallow, short-lived attempt to do so is now over. For instance, if you fail to reprimand people who break the rules set out in the organizational constitution, your employees won’t take it seriously. And what kind of message would it send to, say, give a speech about respecting your colleagues one day, and then to honk aggressively at an employee in the parking lot the next? So, living by your organization’s constitution is essential to changing its culture. To do so, you’ll need to have a personal constitution, that is, a personal statement comprising four values, and four behaviors that correspond to those values. Start with your purpose. Think of it as your foundation, your personal mission statement. For example, the author’s purpose is to push workplace leaders to foster inspiration and discover their own values. Next, search for your values and the behaviors that reflect them. To find your values, think about what you’re proud to be known for, things like wonder, stability, creativity and so on. Then, assign a clear and measurable behavior to each value. For instance, if you choose “wonder” as a value, a corresponding behavior might be to read at least two books a month or to ask more questions. Now that you’ve got your personal constitution, give it a leadership philosophy: something that describes how you believe people should be led and motivated! Now that you’ve written your personal constitution, use the same techniques to write your organizational constitution. Start with your organization’s purpose statement, then define its values and assign each value a behavior that will help put it into practice. When writing your company’s purpose statement, make it captivating and inspiring, but also be sure to explain what your company does, for whom and why. Remember, this will be the mission statement for your organization. Make your purpose statement even better by learning from others’ mistakes: Avoid saying that the only purpose of your company is to make money, or simply describing what products or services you offer. For your purpose statement to work, it needs to be memorable and inspiring for your customers and employees alike. Take this example purpose statement: To help save trees – one person and one water bottle at a time. Why does it work? It immediately gives you the company’s reason for existing: to make water bottles while aiding the environment. Don’t doubt the importance of your purpose statement; a 2001 study found that purpose statements are an important factor in a company’s long-term survival. Once you have your purpose statement, it’s time to decide on your values and behaviors. Now that you know how to choose personal values, the next step is to figure out what your company’s values are and define them as specifically as possible. For instance, if your two values are excellence and respect, you could say that excellence means going beyond the expectations of your customers, while respect means being considerate to everyone, both inside and outside the company. Once you’ve defined your values, you can assign them behaviors that will make them a reality. For the value of excellence, you could be sure to embrace feedback and know everything about your business. Likewise, behaviors that reflect respect might include choosing your words carefully and encouraging employees to give each other honest praise. But don’t get too carried away. When setting your values and corresponding behaviors, try to keep the list to between three and five of each. So, you’ve designed your organizational constitution and are excited to revolutionize your company culture, but when you introduce your ideas they’re met with some resistance. How can you handle employees who don’t support your approach? Start by understanding that resistance comes in many forms.   The first opposition will probably come from the leaders of your organization, like managers and supervisors. After all, they’re the first ones you’ll ask to embrace the new company culture. They’re likely to express their resistance in one of two ways: One possibility is that they won’t walk the walk, meaning that although they promise to adopt the new practices, their behavior will suggest otherwise and they won’t become the ideal example you need. Or, they’ll actively oppose the initiative by disregarding it or voicing complaints about the organizational constitution, claiming that it’s a waste of time. Don’t panic, dealing with resistant leaders is easy: First of all, don’t take it personally. Naturally you’ll be upset, but take a deep breath and remember that they’re not opposing you, they’re opposing a change to their habits. Once you’ve calmed down, explain the issues with your resistant employee’s behavior as non-judgmentally as possible. This will show him that you’ve noted the problems and that they need to change. When confronting your employee, you should only discuss their clear, observable behavior, and not the beliefs or motivations behind it. Now that you’ve told the employee how you perceive his behavior, give him a chance to voice his problems with the organizational constitution. It’s important that you work to understand his perspective, even if you disagree with it. After hearing his stance, don’t budge. Explain to your employee that this is non-negotiable; every leader must be in line with the values of the company. Once your employee has heard your needs, give him a chance to change his behavior. If he doesn’t, he needs to be let go. Now that your organization has adopted its constitution, there’s still one last hurdle to clear. It’s essential that all new employees are in line with the company’s stated values. Why? Because hiring just one person who’s against the organizational culture could unravel all the hard work you’ve invested. It’s important to attract the right people. Say you hire a new manager with great experience and the right skills. If he rejects the organizational constitution, your employees will assume that you don’t care about it either. Pretty soon, this new manager will erode the trust and engagement between your employees that you have worked hard to foster. So, instead of looking for the most skilled people, look for the ones with both the right skills and the right commitment to your organization’s mission. How? Ensure prospective candidates understand your organizational culture. Make this information available by including your company’s purpose, values and expectations for behavior in every job posting you make! This way you can be sure to attract only people who share your values. But hiring the right people won’t matter if they don’t adjust to your culture. So make sure to take the time and effort necessary to integrate new hires. When taking new employees on board, make sure they experience cultural exposure, an explicit educational session on your organizational culture. Explain the expected behavior and praise new hires when they display it. Another way to orientate new employees is through a mentor, ideally someone other than the employee’s supervisor. The mentor and employee should meet every couple of weeks for the first few months to talk about whatever the new employee wants. The topic of conversation isn’t limited to issues that HR can resolve, but can be about anything work-related. The mentor-mentee relationship is productive because the mentor can answer questions the new employee might be scared to ask publicly, while showing him how to abide by the organization’s purpose, values and behavior. The key message in this book: The culture of a company is one of its most valuable attributes, but building a culture that an entire organization can embrace is no simple task. Using an organizational constitution to formally outline an entity’s purpose, values and associated behaviors can provide a clear and organized format for any group to rally around.

In every culture, we are conditioned to see particular communication styles as more desirable than others, which can lead to conflict. If you take a little time to understand a person's cultural background and his corresponding worldview, you will be able to communicate with him more effectively and avoid the risk of misunderstanding. Erin Meyer’s eight different scales will help you do exactly this, specifically in the business world. In these blinks, you’ll learn: why witnessing a shouting match in Paris might not mean what you think; how the Vikings’ democratic style lives on in Sweden; and how to safely criticize someone from any part of the world. Why do we find communicating with people from other countries so challenging sometimes? We often have to deal with different temperaments, values and senses of humor. In order to navigate these situations, we should try to avoid being what the Japanese call kuuki yomenai, which translates to someone who “cannot read the air.” We can better “read the air” if we consider that communication styles can fall on a communicating scale, and be grouped into low-context cultures and high-context cultures. Western countries, such as the USA or Australia, are known as low-context cultures, where communication is precise and clear in order to avoid misinterpretation. Contrastingly, communication in high-context cultures in countries such as Japan or Korea are more subtle and layered and often require reading between the lines to understand what is meant. No country, however, is 100 percent low or high context. French managers, for instance, tend to be more high-context than German managers, but are low-context compared to Chinese managers. Why do different countries have different contexts? The answers can be found in history. High-context cultures like Japan have had largely a homogenous population, therefore people became tuned to subtle nuances in communication and developed skills in “reading the air.” American history, on the other hand, is much shorter and has been strongly influenced by immigrants, requiring their communication to be explicit to avoid misunderstandings. So how can you work well with other cultures? You need to strike a balance between listening and speaking. When working with high-context cultures, listen for meaning and not what is actually spoken. Pay attention to changes in body language, like head-shaking or noticing self-restraint that shrouds the meaning of a message. The opposite is true when working with low-context cultures. You should be as specific as possible and take time to explain yourself clearly. When multiple cultures are working together, the most effective method of communication is to use the low-context style as this causes fewer misunderstandings. If you’ve ever worked with people from other cultures, you may have had the misfortune of accidentally offending someone when you just wanted to offer them some feedback. To gain some understanding of why this happens, let’s look at the evaluating scale. When we give negative feedback, it can be direct or indirect. Direct cultures like Russia or Israel are forthright in feedback to their colleagues. They also often use absolute descriptions known as upgraders, such as “totally” or “strongly” to emphasize their point.  For example, they might say “I totally disagree with your opinion. It is absolutely unprofessional.“ In addition, it is not unusual to criticize in front of a group. Japan or Indonesia , however, are indirect cultures, which means they provide gentle feedback and cover negative messages with positive ones. They also use downgraders, like “kind of” or “maybe” to get their message across. For example “Maybe you should reconsider your opinion a little bit.” And, as opposed to the style of direct cultures, criticism is given privately. So if we take the communication scale from the previous blink and the evaluating scale we can see four groups: Low-Context and Direct-Feedback: e.g., Germany High-Context and Direct-Feedback: e.g., Russia Low-Context and Indirect-Feedback: e.g., USA High-Context and Indirect-Feedback: e.g., Japan To work better with diverse cultures, bear these styles in mind and adapt your feedback to reduce the likelihood of offending others. When meeting with people from high-context and indirect cultures such as Japan, avoid delivering feedback in front of others and adjust your message while retaining its meaning. Sometimes it’s even appropriate not to mention negative aspects of an idea or suggestion and just highlight the positive ones. By doing so, it will become clear to the person you’re dealing with that you would prefer the other aspects to fall to the wayside. By adapting your behavior and observing others’ feedback style, you should reach your desired outcome of being perceived as polite and supportive. How do different cultural backgrounds affect the way we perceive persuasion? Let’s use the persuading scale, which consists of principles-first reasoning and applications-first reasoning. Principles-first reasoning is deductive and uses general principles to draw conclusions. Take learning a new language, for example: first you learn the grammatical principles, then you start speaking the language. Applications-first reasoning, on the other hand, is inductive. You present a theory first, then you state the facts that support it. This method is typically used in math class: the student first gets a formula and then practices applying it. After practicing applying it, the students starts to understand its principles. Cultures which use principles-first reasoning, like France or Italy, are more inclined to draw attention to why something is requested, before they decide to carry it out. In contrast, application-first cultures such as the US or Canada center on the how more than the why. Therefore, it’s not unusual for a French employee to become frustrated with an American boss when instructed on how to do something without clarifying the reason why. The best way to deal with these differences, then, is to switch back and forth between explaining the principles behind your point and showing its practical application. Let's say you're giving a presentation at an international conference on why your product is superior to your competition's. You could begin by presenting how your product is made to satisfy the principles-first audience. Then offer some practical examples, like videos of people using your product, to draw in your application-first audience. How can acknowledging cultural styles help your workflow and leadership? To find out, let’s examine the leading scale which involves egalitarian and hierarchical cultures. Egalitarian cultures, like Denmark or the Netherlands, have a narrow gap between employees and managers, where managerial roles often focus on mediation between equals. Their organizational structures are flat, so a marketing director may work directly with a copywriter, and both parties are comfortable using each other’s first names. However, countries like China and Nigeria have distinct hierarchical structures, with noticeable gaps between boss and employees. In these structures, bosses lead and make decisions. Communication also follows a firm hierarchy: to reach the person three positions superior to you, you need to first talk to the person directly above you. They will then go directly above them to reach the person you need. Note that how countries are grouped geographically does not necessarily mean they fall in the same place on the leading scale. For example, France and Sweden are both European, but fall on different ends of the scale, with France being more hierarchical. As Professor André Lauren found, this difference stems from historical differences in leadership. France was influenced by the hierarchical and centralized political system of the Roman Empire, while Swedish history was impacted by the Vikings, one of the world’s first democracies, in which its people’s opinions were considered equal. Coping with these differences means understanding how different cultures react to your requests. Employees in egalitarian cultures must be included when making decisions. Don’t supervise, but rather facilitate. Provide room for autonomy and increase your involvement only when things are not progressing well. When you’re leading hierarchical cultures, encourage employees to offer their opinion; without an invitation, they won’t. Most importantly, make clear that you are in a position which requires people to look up to you. This might mean using your surname, instead of your first, for example. Being egalitarian at work doesn’t mean that decisions are automatically made by consensus. The same applies to hierarchical cultures. Actually, decision-making has its own cultural scale. The deciding scale consists of consensual at one end and top-down at the other. Consensual countries such as Sweden or the Netherlands take their time in group discussions until a consensus is reached. Once a decision is made, the time it takes to implement it is short, as it’s already been approved by all involved. Decisions in top-down countries like China or India, are made individually and usually by the boss. They are made more quickly than consensual countries, but are often revisited and altered later on. Because of this continuous revision, changes can take more time to implement. For example, in the Japanese ringi-system, a proposal document (ringisho) is offered to mid-management. Each person here can edit this document until a consensus is reached. The document is then handed to the next management level where the process is repeated until the document reaches the top level. Therefore, the ringi system is both highly consensual and hierarchical. It’s wise not to make snap judgements on how decisions are made if you’re only aware of the organizational structure. As with the ringi-system, some structures appear top-down but are actually consensual as well. When working in a multicultural environment, it’s best to stick with one decision-making method. Early on, clarify whether decisions will be consensual or made by a boss. Also, decide how vital a total consensus is and how flexible the decision-making process should be. Will it be fixed for a few years, or will it be something that can be changed every few weeks? Finally, when it comes to major decisions, review the method and make sure all involved understood and accepted it. As the Russian proverb goes, “Trust, but verify.” Many cultures have established rules in place to make sure businesses don’t just lean on trust alone. Even so, trust is central to business negotiations and can be split into cognitive trust and affective trust. Cognitive trust occurs when we have worked with someone for a long time and have established them to be reliable. Affective trust involves our friends and relatives and comes more from emotions, rather than experiences. On the trusting scale, cultures may be grouped as high task-based to high relationship-based. In regards to business, task-based cultures like the US and the Netherlands create trust by means of business-related achievements. Depending on how good it is for business or profits, a relationship can be forged or dissolved easily. For example, Americans are unlikely to be bothered if a longstanding colleague is fired for performing poorly. But relationship-based countries like Brazil and China form their partnerships according to shared personal experiences. In China, an agreement between executives cannot be reached until they have developed what is known as guanxi. So you should take the time, energy and effort to establish an emotional connection with people from these cultures. The bottom line though, anywhere you go or regardless of the culture with which you’re working, is that creating affective trust is useful. Relationship-based trust hinges on affective trust, while task-based trust relies on cognitive trust. Relationship-based trust proves more advantageous, because you can use it anywhere, whereas task-based only applies in certain cultures. One way you can create trust with cultures you’re unfamiliar with is by identifying commonalities. For example, you discuss more personal topics such as family or music. Sharing these commonalities shows you are interested in the other person, not just the business, and that care will help you gradually build a personal relationship with your business colleague. In relationship-based cultures, it’s best to show your true self so don’t fret about saying or doing something wrong. In some cultures, disagreements are welcome. Bear in mind, though, are you disagreeing with somebody personally or with her idea? The disagreeing scale allows us to see how confrontation is appreciated or evaded. Cultures with confrontational disagreeing patterns, like Israel or France, differentiate between the person and the idea they disagree with and open confrontations don’t negatively impact relationships. So in Paris, for example, if you see two people arguing openly with one another, this doesn’t necessarily mean that they aren’t good friends. In cultures which avoid confrontation such as Indonesia or Japan, open confrontation is seen as inappropriate and disruptive to the harmony of the group. In addition, a person and the idea they offer are strongly connected, so disputing someone's idea is seen as an attack on the person. Another factor to consider is emotional expression. Cultures can be either emotionally expressive or inexpressive. For instance, Germany and France are both confrontational cultures, but their disagreement styles differ. Germans tend to disagree objectively, without involving personal emotions. This way they distinguish between the person and their idea. So you likely won’t encounter as many open emotional disputes in Berlin as in Paris. France can be described as emotionally expressive, which makes it difficult for non-French people to tell if they themselves are being criticized or just their idea. In order to maintain relationships with different cultures, you will need to understand how disagreement is handled within them. In cultures that avoid disagreement, holding pre-meetings without the boss can help to prepare for criticism. This way employees can come together and offer their thoughts as a group. This makes for a consensus critique, as opposed to a critique of an individual, whether it’s the boss or an employee. When you work with cultures that are more confrontational than your own, approach disagreement with caution. However, you needn’t totally convert to the other culture’s confrontational style if it doesn’t feel natural to you, instead it’s better to take part in a relaxed debate. How is it that being late in Germany could indicate punctuality in France? Well, time perception differs between cultures and can range from linear to flexible on the final scale we will look at, the scheduling scale. Countries like Germany and Switzerland approach tasks in a linear way, finishing one task before they begin the next. More value is placed on adhering to deadlines and schedules than being adaptable or flexible in business. It’s also considered impolite to behave in a way that’s not related to the task at hand. So answering your cell phone or chatting to your colleague during a meeting would give a negative impression. However, flexible-time cultures like Saudi-Arabia or Kenya deal with tasks as they arise and many things may be addressed at the same time. Adaptability is ranked higher than organization and meetings aren’t conducted in a linear way. Even though there may be a predefined schedule, it’s common for discussions to stray, for subgroups to form and for discussions to turn into topics that weren’t clearly stated in the schedule. How can you work among varying scheduling cultures? You can learn how the people you’ll be working with deal with tasks and then emulate this method yourself. For example, since linear-cultures adhere to schedules, try to do this when you present a schedule for them. Plan your meetings in detail, emphasize punctuality and stick to your planned theme. When working with flexible cultures, plan your meetings without predetermined limits. In a managerial position, you should adapt and cope with needs as they come up. Also, building a team culture with its own scheduling rules can help when dealing with different cultures. You could try an exercise, for example, in which the people in your group imagine they are all from Switzerland, where punctuality is of high importance. You could agree that each time somebody arrives late, they have to contribute five Euros to the end-of-year party. The key message in this book: With some understanding, education and flexibility, you can learn to adapt your communication and leadership styles to different cultures. By doing so, you can avoid conflict and conduct business successfully all over the world. Actionable advice: Understand there are differences between countries, even if they are geographically close to one another. France and Germany may border each other, for example, but it doesn’t mean they conduct business in the same way. Although both tend toward open confrontation, Germans are far less likely to display emotion when doing so. When dealing with Chinese culture, ask for input if you would like it. Because of China’s hierarchical system, a Chinese business person is unlikely to speak up during a meeting. That tendency is not due to shyness, but to respect. If you would like his input, you’ll need to ask for it directly.

It can be hard to know how to motivate yourself, or even figure out if you’re having a positive influence on those around you. If only there was some sort of wisdom or guidance that could provide answers! As with many things, the Greeks got there first: schools of philosophy have been with us for almost 2,500 years. Many philosophies tie themselves in knots considering pointless questions, such as “How many angels can dance on the head of a pin?”, or the Platonist Plutarch’s infamous “Which came first? The chicken or the egg?” But Stoicism is a different sort of philosophy. This school of philosophy was founded in Athens in the early third century BCE and dealt with the struggles of everyday life. What we know about Stoicism is based on the surviving texts of three great intellectuals in the Roman Empire who were versed in the original Greek theories: there are the meditative essays of the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius, the personal letters of playwright and philosopher Seneca the Younger and the handbooks and lectures of the slave-turned-renowned-teacher Epictetus. Join the authors as they lead you through these classical texts, sifting out the fundamentals of Stoicism and answering that eternal question: “How best should I live?” In these blinks, you’ll learn which heavyweight boxer was a Stoic in the ring; how Stoicism can help you in a POW camp; and how Julius Caesar’s destruction of the Roman Republic led to a very Stoic suicide. We often think of philosophy as a bookish pursuit, or perhaps as the lifestyle choice of bearded old men living ascetically in caves. But Stoicism isn’t like that – it’s for the real world. If you’re going to be a Stoic, you'll have to be plugged in and aware of yourself and those around you. The first precondition of any philosophy is clear thinking. And for Stoicism, that means beginning with self-examination. The great Stoic teacher of the second century CE, Epictetus, got to the heart of the matter in his Discourses. He stated that we become philosophers the moment we first examine our preconceived notions, and ask questions about our emotions, beliefs and even the words we use each day. By this process, we become attuned to the possibility of analyzing our own minds. It’s no easy task of course. Ego and self-deception impede learning; no one is going to learn anything new if they think they know everything already. That’s why honest and truthful self-assessment is critical. The downside to this is that you’ll have to take a good hard look at your weaknesses. It might be scary to admit you have them and that you might have been thinking too highly of yourself all along. On the other hand, it’s just as dangerous to undersell yourself. Try to remember those moments in life when you've risen to the occasion. Aside from self-reflection, it’s also important to be aware of those around you. The people with whom you choose to spend your time will ultimately influence the kind of person you become. If you’re around people who push you to be better, you’ll improve. Of course, the opposite dynamic is true: people may try to bring you down to their level. The Roman playwright and philosopher Seneca, who was a generation older than Epictetus, advised that we should each keep someone in mind whom we respect and admire. Their presence in our mind is sure to guide better judgments and actions. The eighteenth-century economist Adam Smith was of a similar mind, and even had a name for it: the indifferent spectator. For Smith, it didn’t even have to be a real person. The mere thought that someone is witnessing and sympathetically judging our behavior will help us. The general principle of these two points is clear: if we get to know ourselves and others better, we’ll be able to see our own actions in a clearer light. Modern life is overwhelming. Messages bombard us, work is all-pervasive and politics is one big roller-coaster. It’s no wonder so many of us end up getting constantly distracted. But we don’t have to give in to distraction – it is possible to maintain focus. Take Bill Belichick, the coach of the New England Patriots, an American football team. He gets his players to block out interference and noise through a simple instruction: “Do your job.” It’s a reminder to the players to reduce their focus to the task in front of them. Everything extraneous to the immediate situation can and must be blocked out. The Roman Emperor and adherent to Stoicism, Marcus Aurelius, had another way of putting it. He advised that we approach each task as if it were our last. Work like that and you’ll find that external distractions will quickly dissipate. You can also heed another of Marcus Aurelius’s excellent suggestions: create your own mantra. Something like \"I am able to keep out anything that might disturb me; I can see things for what they are, and not give them undue attention” might do the trick. But your mantra can be anything you want. Use whatever words feel natural to you – just remember their purpose. They’re there to shut down anything that might lead you astray. There’s another way you can keep your focus. If you recognize and accept that some things are simply beyond your control, you’ll ensure that your attention is fixed only on what’s important. For the Stoics, the mind is the only thing you can truly control. In contrast, you may think you have control over your body, but it’s going to get sick or injured whether you like it or not. And it’s a good thing to realize your limits, as this will help lift the burden of responsibility. The only thing you need to worry about is your mind, and the choices and actions that are the consequences of its reasoning. Practically speaking, you can use this knowledge to create a useful daily routine. In the morning, take a minute to remind yourself of what you can and cannot control. Focus only on the former. At midday, remind yourself that the only ability you really possess is the capacity to make choices. And before you turn in for the night, think again how much is outside of your control. You can sleep easy knowing that, as Epictetus taught, those matters can be left for “God and fortune.” The former US president Theodore Roosevelt was an odd sort of fellow. He almost died exploring a river in the Amazon, he needlessly slaughtered thousands of animals on safari and he even begged to be allowed to enlist as a soldier in the First World War, even though, at 59 years old, he was too old to fight. Roosevelt was hardly short of great accomplishments. But the problem was that he was driven by such a compulsion to action, it was difficult for him to grasp their relative importance or worth. Much like Roosevelt, most of us are prone to letting our impulses dictate our actions. But you needn’t fall into the Rooseveltian trap; intelligence and reason can help you determine whether it’s really worth taking action. For instance, just because a plate of cookies is sitting in front of you, it doesn’t mean the emotional impulse to take one – or five – should win. You are in control. In fact, putting your emotions to one side is a decision that will get you far. Look at the American heavyweight boxing champion Joe Louis. His calm, unemotional demeanor in the ring gave him the upper hand even before he let loose with an uppercut. It was what earned him his nickname, the “Ring Robot.” There are still going to be times though when action seems like it’s your only option. But it's then that a spot of premeditation is sure to reap rewards. Julius Caesar’s longtime rival, the senator Cato the Younger, was famed for this. When he first entered politics, everyone expected the world from him. However, instead of giving way to pressure and delivering the profound speeches expected of a politician on the rise, he resisted the temptation. Cato repressed his ego and took the time to examine and honestly evaluate his own thoughts. Although his powers of address could move the masses like no other, he chose only to speak when he was sure that his words were worth hearing. All this goes to show that even though emotions are capable of inducing us to action, there’s good reason to avoid letting them rule us. Stoics know that the vast majority of us aren’t nearly as intelligent as we’d have ourselves think. What’s more, it’s clear to them that the trick to improving ourselves is to remain humble and identify the flaws in our thinking. You can start by testing your thinking for biases. As Malcolm Gladwell points out in his book Blink, the mind’s powerful ability to make split-second decisions based on experience also has a downside: it’s just as easy for us to self-affirm our prejudices at the same lightning speed. Consequently, this means that before you act on an impression, you should always pause and consider what assumptions you've brought to the decision. Ask yourself questions like “What could I have overlooked here?” or perhaps \"Is it possible I’m wrong about this?” All it takes is a little bit of self-assessment; you’ll find that it goes a long way to avoiding embarrassing mistakes. The same principle holds true when it comes to evaluating patterns of behavior. In fact, it could even be said that the psychologist Albert Ellis effectively popularized Stoicism through his development of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT patients are taught to look for patterns in their thoughts and actions that don't serve them well. Then, over time, they attempt to rework those patterns into forms they can benefit from. The Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius had much the same idea. He instructed his readers to look for cause and effect in their thoughts and actions, and thereby understand what sorts of actions result from particular prejudices. Another way to identify flaws in thinking is to stay alert to an all-too-human tendency: Do you automatically and involuntarily add interpretation to what you observe? Seventeenth-century samurai swordsman and philosopher Musashi had some choice Stoic words for this impulse – and he wasn’t even formally a Stoic! According to Musashi, a person can look at something with an observing eye or a perceiving eye. There’s a big difference between the two. The observing eye sees things for what they truly are. In contrast, the perceiving eye imbues things with meaning. It’s the perceiving eye’s tendency to add its own spin and prejudice to things that can cause trouble. It causes stress where none is necessary. The multitude of possibilities that face us each and every day can be overwhelming, to say the least. It’s no wonder, then, that a lot of us are crippled by indecision. You can overcome this by setting clear goals for your actions. That should really help clarify your priorities. And what’s the noblest goal of all? Why, it’s nothing less than behaving as the best version of yourself. Try imagining the person that you’d like to be. Then, appraise your actions. Are you acting as the person you’d like to be would? If not, then don’t procrastinate in resolving the issue. Marcus Aurelius understood the tendency to put things off until tomorrow. He pointed out that if you want to change something about yourself, the best day for action is always today. Think of yourself like an archer taking aim at a target. You’re only going to hit a target that you aim at, and you’ll certainly only hit something if you actually let go of that arrow! Ultimately, then, procrastination is best thought of as a form of resistance that blocks you from achieving your goal. As author Steven Pressfield points out, we all tend to say, “I’ll do it tomorrow”, when what we really mean is “I’m never going to do it.” You’ll also find that what’s just as valuable as achieving a goal in itself is the journey to get there. Have you ever heard the phrase “It’s the process, not the product”? That’s the Stoic approach to life encapsulated: life isn’t about big, earth-shaking epiphanies, but incremental progress. Ideals are there to carry us through the small events in life as much as the big ones. Epictetus loved reminding his students of this outlook, especially when they convinced themselves that they were philosophical geniuses. He taught them that the perfect Stoic, whose every thought and action is exemplary, doesn’t actually exist – it’s just an ideal to strive toward. In the end, all you can do is focus yourself, begin and persist. Stoicism will help you improve your life, but it has to be done step by step. It’s great to plan ahead, but plans can only get you so far. True success comes from finding ways to deal with whatever obstacles come your way. The same approach informs the Stoic mentality. Instead of obsessively planning ahead, Stoics spend time fostering creativity, independence and inventiveness. This makes them flexible, as well as resilient in the face of changing circumstance. In short, they can solve any problem that life throws at them. In fact, Epictetus went so far as to think it risible for students to ask his advice. Instead, he said, they should ask him to help shape their minds to be adaptable, and become self-sufficient. A flexible outlook means that Stoics are mentally prepared to see the opportunity in setbacks. One way they achieve this is by having what the authors call a reverse clause – in other words, a backup option. If you formulate one, you’ll never see your progress as halted. It will just be redirected, and you’ll retain momentum. So what do you do if your computer erases your work? No problem. It’s an opportunity to start fresh on a new and improved version. There’s one more important quality Stoics have: if they see something isn’t working, they just let it go. Epictetus said just that in his Stoic handbook for daily life, the Enchiridion. His idea was that every situation has two metaphorical “handles,” that is, two ways you can approach it. One can be used to “carry” it, while the other can’t. Journalist William Seabrook saw living proof of this for himself in 1933. He sought treatment for his alcoholism by committing himself to an asylum. But despite the tough measures, he found he was making little headway. Then, when he was on the brink of being expelled from the asylum for his continued issues and bad behavior, Epictetus’s metaphor of the two handles crossed his mind – and jolted him into action. He would come to let go of the handle he’d been gripping to that point, as there was no point struggling against his circumstances, and he would instead try the other handle. Invigorated, he embraced recovery and began to enjoy not only the asylum but also sobriety. Seabrook’s openness toward new perspectives and willingness to learn ultimately helped him reach his desired goal. As far as the Stoics are concerned, the order of the world is a natural phenomenon. Consequently, every aspect of life is interconnected and thus has a specific duty to fulfill. The mission or duty for students of Stoicism is to aspire to virtuousness. Virtue is seen as the highest purpose one can commit to. What’s more, virtue itself is a composite concept comprising justice, honesty, discipline and courage. There’s no point living your life with goals other than virtue in mind. You might, for example, bust a gut to earn money, but that will just lead to further problems and a desire for more cash. That’s true of climbing towering mountains too – you’ll just want to reach the next summit. Virtue is different, though. For the Stoics, either you’re a virtuous person or you’re not, and which category you fall into depends on the actions you take. That’s what makes virtue so incredibly valuable. Of course, the other side to virtuousness is that you have to be entirely self-committed to achieve it: no one’s going to make you do it. As Seneca wrote in his Moral Letters, “Every noble deed is voluntary.” The great benefit to acting virtuously is that it will cut through all of life's confusions. Look at Marcus Aurelius: as Emperor, his political, personal legal and military responsibilities were massive, and he must have been overwhelmed at times. But he kept his head above the water by applying a simple lesson: duty must come first, be it in the form of professional responsibilities or obligations to others. It was the Stoic’s belief in interconnectedness that guided their belief that we are all obligated to one another. As Marcus Aurelius put it in his Meditations, working with others is what “you’ve been made by nature for.” There’s no motivator like the desire to achieve wonders for the common good. After all, each of us has a stake in progress and civilization. Look at it from another perspective: our pets could spend all day snoozing if they wanted, but we human beings owe it to one another to get out of bed for the common good. From another perspective, if duty is foremost in your mind, laziness will never be a concern! Philosophy sometimes gets a bad rap as an ivory tower occupation. But Stoic thinking is different. It’s about achieving results, and not getting sidetracked on the way there. That’s why the special quality of Stoics is getting things done no matter the circumstances. As we saw earlier, former US president Theodore Roosevelt struggled with impetuousness. But he also knew how to keep on striving even when the going got tough. After he’d undergone surgery, he was told that he might be a wheelchair user for the rest of his life. But he wasn’t disheartened: he simply responded “All right! I can work that way too!” Artists are also people who tend to find themselves stuck in their work. They chase inspiration with new experiences or new locations, but they often just find themselves blocked. That’s because, ultimately, if you’re looking for the perfect set of working conditions, then you’re just deceiving yourself. In reality, it makes no difference where you are, you’re just going to have to get down to it and press on. The same principle goes for practicing stoicism itself. It’s for real-world situations – there’s certainly no need to enter a monastery to live stoically. Another truth that Stoicism recognizes is that while the things we do might be imperfect, this doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try. This kind of disproportionate thinking, including “all-or-nothing” thinking, will ultimately impede you. Psychologists refer to these as cognitive distortions. And they usually lead to unhappiness. In his book Rules for Radicals, community organizer Saul Alinsky argued that we shouldn’t let our idealism limit us in setting our goals. An organizer, Alinsky claims, has to accept that the world is as it is before she tries to change it. Accepting things as they really are doesn’t weaken the desire for change; in fact, it makes the effort to do so more effective. One step at a time and it will get done: that’s the Stoic way. Stoics believe that no matter what happens to us, we always remain in control of who we are. As a nod to this, they even name the space inside each of us that houses the soul the Inner Citadel. No matter what each of us physically endures, this Citadel will remain impregnable. The only danger the Citadel faces, therefore, comes from within. Because of this mentality, Stoics prefer to rely on themselves rather than circumstance. Cato the Younger, whom we looked at earlier, liked to be prepared for any eventuality that might befall him. For instance, even though he could afford clothes, he chose never to don a hat regardless of the weather conditions and walked around barefoot, so that he could learn to be prepared for any circumstances. After all, to a Stoic, misfortune is just another opportunity to become stronger. In On Providence, Seneca even claims that someone who has never known difficulty is unlucky; it shows he’s never been tested, so there’s no way he’ll know his true potential. There’s a second consequence to the Inner Citadel: Stoics know that only they have power over their own minds, which makes them very resilient. US pilot and Navy vice admiral James Stockdale was living proof of this. When his plane was shot down over Vietnam, he knew that incredible hardships would follow. But, as he came down, he realized that Epictetus could be his salvation. He knew he could hold out. Stockdale spent the next seven-and-a-half years as a prisoner of war, during which he was brutally tortured by his captors. But he never sought solace in unrealistic expectations of sudden liberation, and he never allowed the experience to change who he was. Stockdale knew that staying true to himself was his best hope of resistance. Indeed, he was so committed to this philosophy that he once deliberately injured himself so that he wouldn't be forced by his captors to appear in a propaganda video. As a Stoic, he knew that though there was nothing he could change about his situation, he could always control his reaction to it. Fortitude in difficult circumstances is an admirable skill, but as we’ll examine now, you don’t always have to go it alone. Violence and cruelty were all-pervasive in Antiquity. Animals and people were killed for entertainment in amphitheaters across the Roman Empire, while conquered peoples were routinely sold into slavery. It was hardly an atmosphere that encouraged positive feelings of camaraderie. What’s fascinating is that Stoicism – which reached philosophical maturity at that time – actually saw the workings of all people and creatures as connected. The Stoics called this interconnectedness sympatheia. It helped them envisage everything as part of a larger whole. In his Meditations, Marcus Aurelius described how everything in the universe was interconnected. He even explained through an analogy how people should be imagined as bees living in the same hive: what is bad for the beehive will ultimately be bad for the bees. To put it the other way around, anything that isn’t harmful to the community can’t ultimately harm the individual. Because a wise person understands that the good of the many is always the highest priority, this means that all impulses and actions should ultimately be directed toward that aim. Doing the right thing by the community is all well and good in theory, but right action does sometimes require a fair bit of personal motivation. After all, it can be tempting to act selfishly, but it doesn’t usually end up doing you any good in the long run. For instance, we might occasionally convince ourselves that enacting a spot of revenge will do us a world of good. But actually losing control like that just makes us sick. As a rather disturbing example, vomit is often found at crime scenes for precisely this reason. And what’s true of crime also holds for lying and cheating. It just makes us feel worse for acting in a way we know is unethical. Here’s a practical exercise that will make acting correctly easier. Before doing anything, ask yourself once again, \"Is this what the person I’d like to be would do?\" Think about the standards you’d set for yourself and use those to guide you in the present moment. It’s a common tendency to think of hope as good, and fear as bad. But Stoics are skeptical of both. After all, both hope and fear involve attaching value to future events which are, by definition, out of our control. So instead of focusing on wishes and worries, Stoics prefer amor fati, “a love of fate.” In other words, they go a step further than throwing up their hands saying “que sera sera.” They embrace the vicissitudes of fate. Rather than pointlessly wishing they could change events to fit their desires, Stoics instead adapt their desires to the situation. This is the Stoics’ art of acquiescence. All in all, it’s a clever strategy. Stoics learn to accept events and take responsibility for their own lives. However, it’s important to note that acceptance isn’t shorthand for passivity. Let’s look at former US President Franklin D. Roosevelt. He had craved and worked toward the office of the presidency his entire life. But suddenly, at the age of 39, he was diagnosed with polio. FDR knew that there was nothing that he could do about the disease, but he recognized his reaction to it was entirely his choice. He therefore decided to calmly accept the situation, while refusing to see himself as a victim. The rest is history: FDR went on to be elected to the presidency four times. Another good example is the civil rights leader Malcolm X. He was incarcerated early in life, but instead of fuming pointlessly in his cell, he chose to use his time wisely. By the time of his release, he was self-educated, religiously enlightened and highly motivated – all character traits that served him well in the struggle for civil rights. Just think of all that energy you could save by not wishing for the impossible. Success is entirely achievable if you invest that energy, and work with the actual situation as it stands before you. The once mighty Roman Empire fell in the West after 500 years. The longest human lifespan recorded is just 122 years. Everything and everyone must eventually come to an end. That’s why Stoicism teaches us to accept the fact of our ultimate demise. Death isn’t something to worry about, but ignoring its inevitability won’t get us anywhere. Death can be a great motivator, and it might seem helpful to push yourself to live life to the fullest as though you only have a few weeks left to live. But the truth is, we all live with the same diagnosis. Someday, like it or not, we’re all going to die. That should be motive enough without entertaining hypotheticals! Part of the reason why death is so scary is that we have no real knowledge of what it entails. But some of history’s greatest minds have mulled it over, and their thoughts can provide some solace. Even great minds turn to other great minds in times of trouble. The philosopher Cato the Younger decided to kill himself rather than witness Julius Caesar’s destruction of the institutions of the Roman Republic. As he stared death in the face, he looked to the writings of Plato to give him courage. The Stoics recognize an important feature of death: if it really is the end of everything, there’s nothing to fear. Death brings with it the end of worry, pain and, of course, death itself. In fact, Seneca went so far as to admonish his friends and family when they begged his executioners to spare his life. He scolded them for forgetting their philosophical training. As far as he was concerned, they should have been ready to accept death, just as he was. “To philosophize,” Cicero argued, “is to learn how to die.” Meaning, we can use philosophy to make the most of our time. While it’s interesting to meditate on the wisdom of philosophers and life’s big questions, to Stoics, philosophy serves a practical purpose. It’s a tool that you must use every day to carefully shape your own life. The key message in these blinks: Stoicism is above all a practical philosophy. Instead of being just an abstract framework for cerebral rumination, it provides a set of guiding principles that can help you make better choices in life. Apply Stoicism successfully and you’ll find yourself not just believing in your own abilities; through determination and self-motivation you’ll be able to improve yourself and society as a whole. Actionable advice: Don’t look for happiness in external things. There’s nothing wrong with appreciating fine clothes or a square meal. But the more we let our happiness depend on external rewards, the less free we become. So the next time you’re looking for “likes” on social media or trying to boost your mood with a fancy purchase, ask yourself what meaningful action you could be taking instead.

This was brought to light with Jocko Willink and Leif Babin’s first book, Extreme Ownership. In it, they imparted lessons they learned as Navy SEAL commanders during the 2003 American invasion and subsequent occupation of Iraq. Facing well-organized and heavily-armed insurgents in a foreign territory they discovered the importance of effective leadership. After returning to civilian life, they realized that these war-induced lessons weren’t only applicable in a military setting – they could also be used to increase profits for companies. However, Willink and Babin felt that their first book was misinterpreted by some. Being a good leader isn’t just about being “extreme” – it involves careful balancing a number of dichotomies. This is often hard to achieve, however. Only by harnessing these dichotomies can you implement the wisdom of the hardy Navy SEALs in your organization. In these blinks, you’ll learn what the ultimate dichotomy of leadership is and why you should heed it; how having a big-picture mindset led Babin to saving an Iraqi family; and how the story of one Navy SEAL’s tragic death helped save a mining company. In 2006, Jocko Willink – one of the authors – found himself in Ramadi, Iraq. He’d already been stationed there as a SEAL task unit commander back in 2003, but things were different this time. During the first tour, the US military had things under control, but in 2006 the insurgent mujahideen had unleashed urban guerilla warfare on the city. Willink knew that it was only a matter of time before one of his countrymen would fall in battle. On August 2, insurgents mounted an all-out attack on southern Ramadi and a member of Willink’s task unit, Marc Lee, was killed in the ensuing gunfight. Leif Babin – the other author – had led the platoon into battle as commander and was distraught over the loss. It had been Babin’s call for the SEALs to join the US army in the gunfight – a decision that Willink had approved. Regretting the loss of Lee, Babin told Willink that he wished he’d not led his men into the battle. But Willink informed him that, sometimes, you have to take risks for the greater good. If they’d left their comrades in the army to fight alone, the death toll might have been greater. This is the ultimate dichotomy of leadership – taking care of your team members, while also knowing that you may have to place them in harm’s way for the good of the team. It’s a hard pill to swallow, but recognition of this dichotomy is necessary for any successful leader, both in military or business contexts. For example, after Willink had re-entered civilian life as a leadership consultant he was tasked with convincing the regional manager of a struggling mining company to lay off 80 employees to cut costs. The manager cared deeply about his people and was not willing to let anyone go. Willink helped the manager see the light by explaining the ultimate dichotomy he learned in Ramadi, and how this applies to the business world. If the manager didn’t lay off some employees, corporate might replace him with someone who didn’t care about his team members as much. More people might be laid off and corporate might even shut down the whole mine. The manager came through and let go of 80 people he cared about. The company moved back toward profitability, and the remaining 600 employees had jobs for the near future. Babin experienced his first friendly fire incident in Ramadi in 2006. US Army tanks were unknowingly firing at his unit’s position, so Babin acted fast – under heavy fire, he reprogramed his radio to Army wavelengths and was able to stop the incident. Without the leadership of Willink, this incident might have resulted in fatalities. Months earlier Willink had ordered Babin and the rest of the task unit to learn how to reprogram their SEAL radios to Army wavelengths. Not understanding the importance of the task, however, none of the platoon did so. Days later, the task unit was to engage in a dangerous night raid and Willink asked if everybody had learned how to reprogram the radios. When he learned none had, Willink made sure they all knew how. Those skills would go on to save Babin’s life in the friendly fire incident. A separate incident in 2005 also tested Willink’s leadership skills. Since the Vietnam War, Navy SEALs have sewn unconventional patches onto their uniforms – often with crude, even offensive, slogans. Willink’s task unit was no different. He ordered them to remove all the unprofessional patches. The task force was demoralized and resolved to make a new, less-crude patch they would all wear. When Willink spotted the new patches he wasn’t angry and made no mention of them. He let it slide. Willink knew that leaders only have a certain amount of leadership capital, and that when his ran out, his orders would start carrying less weight. He knew there was a time to stand firm and expend leadership capital. While the radio incident was the right time to take a stand, this wasn’t. He also knew the patches created comradery among the men, so he let them bend the rules. Spending leadership capital wisely is equally important in the business world. For example, one executive vice president of a company that Babin was assessing for his leadership program was getting very annoyed with his departmental leaders. Why? Because they were always on their phones answering emails during meetings. So the VP decided to ban phones from the meetings, much to the disgruntlement of the departmental leaders. Soon after, the EVP realized that the departmental leaders weren’t heeding the company’s new standard operating procedures - a much graver fault. The EVP had spent too much of his leadership capital on the strategically minor ‘no cellphone’ policy instead of getting his leaders to implement the important new procedures. Back in 2003, Willink found himself leading a platoon in a mission in occupied Baghdad. The enemy at this point wasn’t the well-organized insurgents of 2006 – they were little more than armed criminals. The ease of fighting against these enemies had led his men toward arrogance, and most had even stopped wearing their bulletproof back plates so that they could move faster. Once Willink realized this, he had two options: he could either increase platoon inspections and micromanage his men, or he could explain to them why it was important for them to wear their back plates. He opted for the latter, telling them that no matter how much faster they could move without the plates, it wasn’t faster than a bullet. And, no matter how amateur the enemy was, there was always a chance they could be outflanked and taken from behind. From then on, subsequent routine inspections found that the men had put their back plates back on. Instead of micromanaging his men, Willink had shown them the why – by doing so, he’d empowered them to be accountable to themselves. This is no different when it comes to smothering subordinates with excessive accountability in the business world. Willink once consulted a company whose leaders had just implemented new data entry software for offsite technicians to fill in after installing products for customers. The data would provide information to other areas of the company to help them improve service and, hopefully, drive sales. But the technicians were resisting the new data entry tasks, with most of them only half-heartedly completing them after installations. Management opted first for increased accountability checks. Penalties were imposed for technicians who didn’t do the data entry, but this only resulted in them entering useless one- or two-word answers in most fields and the resulting information wasn’t helping anyone at the company. Willink informed the perplexed managers that increasing accountability further wouldn’t help. What they needed to do was to empower the technicians to be accountable to themselves. They needed to know the why.  So Willink helped the management communicate to the technicians that if the software was used correctly, the company could improve its service. By doing so, they’d make more money – and the company would grow. Additionally, technicians would likely get pay raises and even advance up the ladder in the company as it grew. It was, thus, in their interest to use the software. Sometimes, for the good of your team, you have to submit to your boss’s will, even if you find it unjust. Babin once made this clear to Jim, a client who was struggling with his boss. Jim had made his boss jealous by impressing his boss’ boss, and Jim’s boss had taken this out on him by giving him a low performance rating. This affected Jim’s whole team and meant they would all get smaller bonuses, as these were tied to performance ratings. But Jim had a plan to make it right – he’d go to his boss’ boss with numbers to prove his team’s actual performance and force his boss to give him a higher rating. Babin saw through this, however. It would be a Pyrrhic victory, he explained, as this would only turn his boss against him in the future. Instead, Babin explained that to be a good leader, you have to also follow. If Jim wanted what was best for his team, he needed to accept the performance rating so that the team wouldn’t suffer continued bad ratings into the future. But it’s not only important to follow your superiors. Sometimes, as a leader, you need to follow those who follow you. In Ramadi in 2006, deep in the night, Babin and his platoon had the task of securing a tall building. By doing so, they could cover a US Army battalion that was following close behind. Ultimately, the operation would allow them to retake areas of the city from the terrorist group al-Qaeda. Babin had his eyes set on a suitable building, but a lower-ranking officer, Kyle, disagreed and suggested a different one. Kyle was a talented sniper and had more experience than the rest of the team on these sorts of covering missions. Minutes passed without Babin making a decision, but he finally decided to defer to Kyle, regardless of his lower rank. Babin knew that for the whole team to succeed, the leader sometimes has to be a follower. Kyle’s call turned out to be right. The platoon cleared all enemies from the area, a feat they wouldn’t have been able to accomplish in the other, shorter building the author had in mind. In both military and business contexts, leaders must be willing to put their authority aside and follow others. Ramadi was one of the most dangerous cities in the world in 2006. So, when Babin got wind of a special ops team that was requesting his platoon’s assistance in a high-risk mission there, he needed to know all of the planning details. It turned out that the special ops team hadn’t planned for any contingencies or worst-case scenarios.  The mission was to approach a target in broad daylight in a convoy, driving straight down one of the most dangerous roads in the city. “What if an improvised explosive device (IED) detonated under a vehicle?,” Babin asked the special ops unit leader. “It won’t,” he replied. Babin was shaken, and decided to ask a senior officer what he thought about this lack of contingency planning. The officer confirmed his suspicions that this wasn’t a mission that should be executed. Babin tried to convince the special ops unit leader to plan for at least some contingencies, but to no avail. No SEALs would take part in the operation, Babin decided. The mission went on to fail – a vehicle was blown up by an IED and men were seriously wounded, all because of a lack of planning. Sometimes overplanning can be just as dangerous. On a previous mission in Ramadi that same year, Babin and his platoon had been tasked with supporting Marines on a 36-hour operation. He’d drawn up all possible contingencies of what might go wrong and how he might react. In doing so, his rucksack became increasingly laden; extra weapons, extra water, extra everything. During the mission, it was so heavy that he could hardly move. Instead of leading his men, he lost situational awareness and could hardly focus on anything aside from keeping up with the platoon. Though the mission was successful, the author’s overplanning could well have cost lives. These experiences taught Babin important lessons. If you plan for every potential problem, you spread yourself too thin, and additional problems are created. But if you don’t plan at all, you can’t react to possible situations that arise. Instead, a balanced approach to planning should be employed by leaders. Take three or four of the most likely contingencies into account when planning your next operation, as well as the worst-case scenario that might arise, and share this information with your team. In 2006, Babin and his platoon arrived in Ramadi, and were immediately tasked with their first capture/kill mission. It would take place the night after they arrived. Time was of the essence. Babin spent the whole day planning the details of the mission, creating PowerPoint presentations, and several other long documents. As the clock ticked away, he realized he wouldn’t finish all the necessary plans by the time of the mission, so he asked Willink to delay it. Willink declined – the platoon was more than ready for the mission, he said, and it would proceed that night. Willink understood the wider importance of the mission that Babin did not. The platoon was new in town and needed to build momentum right away, in addition this would boost the confidence of all the men involved. Willink knew this was paramount, whereas Babin had let his strategic vision get bogged down in details. The mission was easy, as Willink predicted. From then on, Babin focused on big picture stuff and left the bulk of the details to his platoon. This detachment paid off right away. Months later, while on another capture/kill mission with an Iraqi army unit, Babin’s platoon was in a small, smoke-filled room when AK-47 fire burst out. He immediately assumed it must’ve come from beyond the door to the next room. A platoon member quickly readied a grenade to blast the door open – which would kill everyone inside the next room. While the platoon focused on such tactical decisions, Babin employed his big-picture thinking, looking around the whole room. He noticed an Iraqi army soldier looking down in confusion at his own AK-47 that he’d accidentally discharged. The bullets weren’t coming from the next room after all. Telling his grenade-wielding soldier to stand down, Babin instead placed a small explosive to blow the door open. In the room was a terrified, unarmed Iraqi family. If Babin hadn’t focused on the bigger picture, the whole family would have been killed.   These lessons are equally applicable to the business world. Sometimes, you have to step back from the details in order to see the bigger picture. As a leader, getting away from the daily grind of office life – for example on a leadership retreat – can help you focus on bigger picture issues like long-term company strategy, rather than the day-to-day of conducting business. The key message in these blinks: There are a number of dichotomies that both military and business leaders must understand in order to effectively manage teams. The ultimate leadership dichotomy involves caring for your individual team members while also being ready to sacrifice them for the sake of the group. Finding balance in how you spend your leadership capital is also key – only spend it on things that are important to moving your organization forward. And while you should hold your people accountable, don’t smother them with direction. Finally, always keep in mind that overplanning can be counterproductive, as can focusing too much on small details. So instead, keep your mind on the big picture, and plan only for the likeliest contingencies.  Actionable advice: Be humble, but don’t be passive. Although this is a difficult dichotomy to balance, it’s extremely important. Leaders need to accept constructive criticism from subordinates, and keep their egos in check at all times. At the same time, being overly humble isn’t the solution. Leaders must also be ready to stand up for the good of the whole team when there are negative consequences from not doing so – even in the face of criticism. Got feedback?

As a manager, you can’t dodge them for long. But how do you have a constructive conversation that addresses sensitive issues without being seen as the bully? That’s where the discomfort zone comes in. Learning how to create a safe space for an employee or friend in a conversation gives you the freedom and flexibility to then address the main problem that needs solving, and makes everyone feel involved and valued in the process. These blinks give you a step-by-step approach to having that conversation and getting the results you want every time. In the following blinks, you’ll discover how listening involves not only your ears, but your head, heart and gut; what a “safety bubble” is, and how it can help you earn trust; and how if you let yourself DREAM you’ll successfully change your partner’s thinking. Imagine the captivated look on a young child’s face when she sees snow for the first time. Mouth agape in astonishment, her first thoughts might be, “What is this? Where did it come from?” This response is called the baby stare and it’s not just for children – adults too experience the same feeling of awe. There’s a leadership technique based loosely on the baby stare which aims to inspire employees by disrupting entrenched thinking patterns. It’s called the discomfort zone. A discomfort zone conversation is designed to encourage people to adopt a new perspective, leading them to imagine new solutions to old problems. It works by triggering negative emotions, ultimately forcing people to think more clearly. It might seem counterintuitive that negative emotions can produce positive results. After all, we usually try to avoid discomfort! But negative emotions can actually help us by forcing us to confront reality and break down whatever biases exist in our thinking. For instance, a colleague might feel angry about his performance at work. You try to comfort him and replace his negative outlook with a positive one, by telling him how good his work really is. But this isn’t actually the best approach, as it might give your colleague the wrong idea about acceptable work standards. It might also make him feel embarrassed, for getting emotional for no reason. So instead of placating him, you need to encourage your colleague to face reality and confront his negative feelings. He needs to understand why he thinks his work is subpar, and why this is making him angry. This will allow him to see the situation from a different perspective – the only way he’ll be able to solve the problem. How can you incorporate the discomfort zone in your own life? First, you need to truly listen to the people around you. And this isn’t easy, as listening isn’t just about using your brain. It also requires intuition. Think about this way. When you listen to a friend tell a story, you tend to trust your head brain (where you logically analyze what they’re saying). That’s a good start, but you should also pay attention to your heart brain and your gut brain. Your heart brain gives you a deeper sense of what the other person is feeling. In other words, it allows you to read between the lines. For instance, does your friend seem overwhelmed, even though he claims that he’s not overextending himself? Once you’ve heard what your heart has to say, it’s time to listen to your gut, as it will tell you what’s inspiring your friend’s emotions. For example, if his story keeps going around in circles, your gut brain might make you realize that he’s scared of taking a big leap, or maybe trying to come up with something new. And once you’ve gathered the information from your three brains, you should use it to create a discomfort zone conversation. If you realize that your friend doesn’t seem passionate about what he’s saying, let him know! Confronting his own emotions directly might make him feel uncomfortable, but it will allow him to deal with what he’s actually feeling and think about what’s motivating him. Eventually, this could lead him to understand what he truly wants and what it would take to achieve it. People won’t open up to you if they don’t trust you, which is why you need to approach discomfort zone conversations carefully. This means that you shouldn’t start a difficult conversation in the discomfort zone right away, as that will only make your conversational counterpart feel immediately put on the defensive. To better understand this, imagine you are talking to an employee. If you start by telling him that you’ve noticed some problems with his work, it’s totally normal that he might feel bullied, and therefore be less receptive to constructive criticism. In other words, he won’t be in the right state of mind to work with you to solve the problem. To prevent this, you need to create a safety bubble. That is, try to establish an environment of trust, one which will allow your employee to willingly listen to your criticism and work with you to make a change. So what can you do to create this kind of atmosphere and to let your employee know that you only want the very best for him? Go into the conversation completely focused on the present moment. Relax your body and free yourself from prejudices, worries or thoughts. Arrange to meet in a quiet place where there won’t be any distractions from the phone or email. In this relaxed, open environment, you’ll be able to focus all of your attention on the conversation, which will make you a better, more trustworthy listener and ultimately create a safety bubble. Your employee will also naturally pick up on the fact that you’ve made him your sole concern, which will then make him more receptive to the discomfort zone conversation. Now that we’ve learned the basics, let’s break our discomfort zone technique down into five concrete steps, represented by the acronym, DREAM. The first step is to determine the goal of the conversation. This is crucial; without a clear goal in mind, you can’t have a successful conversation. The way to discover this goal is to start by asking specific questions to get the other person thinking about what he truly needs to solve his problem. A good question to start could be, “What will be easier for you to do once we’ve talked about this problem?” The second step is to reflect on the past to understand why the goal hasn’t already been achieved. This is important because, to get a sense of what a person is thinking and feeling about the problem, you need to know his perspective on relevant past events. For instance, if a manager can’t decide whether to let an employee go, you might not understand the problem at first. But in a discussion of the past, you’ll get better insight into whatever emotions and reasoning are affecting his decision. Perhaps the employee in question performed well in the past, and that’s why the manager is reluctant to let her go. And once you’ve gotten your conversational partner to reflect, you can work with this new knowledge using a technique called summarizing. Say something like, “So I understand that the reason you’re thinking like that is because...” This sentence will not only establish that you’re listening closely (promoting trust), but it will also allow your conversational partner to hear his own views again, and reflect on them. For the following steps in DREAM, read on! The third step in DREAM has to do with breaking down barriers in the other person’s thinking. During this part of the conversation, you’ll need to explore the blind spots to change your partner’s perspective.   Now that the whole story is out in the open and you understand the other person’s reasoning, try to determine what assumptions are guiding his thinking. The idea is to draw out the biases that prevent your partner from finding a solution to the problem at hand. Imagine this scenario. An owner of a small company decides to sell. However, when the time came to make a deal, the owner kept rescheduling, finding new problems he “needed” to solve before he could sell the company. In this case, you could ask: “What would make you feel better: selling the company or not selling it?” If he responds by saying that the thought of keeping the company makes him feel better because he values his employees, you would then ask, “Why don’t you just keep the company?” He might respond by saying that he’s afraid of what others would think if he suddenly changed his mind after months of preparation to sell. Here’s the valuable insight: the owner is motivated by a conflict he’s not even fully aware of. Armed with this information, you could carefully direct him (don’t tell him flat out, as that may make him uncomfortable) to realize this conflict himself. You could ask whether he’d rather avoid embarrassment, sell the company and lose his employees, or admit he made the wrong decision, keep the company and be happy? Is the discomfort zone conversation over once the other person becomes aware of their biases and finds a solution for the problem at hand? Well, no. There’s still two more steps to go! The fourth step is to direct your partner to acknowledge what he’s learned. Although it might seem like a good sign if your partner says, “Ah, I get it now,” at the end of the conversation, that’s vague. It doesn’t actually indicate whether your partner truly understood the conversation’s implications. When a student says they understand a difficult math problem, the teacher wouldn’t just take her at her word, right? Of course not! The student would be asked to demonstrate her understanding by completing the problem on her own. So back to our conversation. The best way to make sure your partner still remembers what you discussed is to actually let him verbalize it. Prompt him by asking, “What would you say was the most important part of our conversation?” And once your partner has satisfactorily acknowledged what he’s learned, you can move on to the fifth and final step: make sure to commit to a follow-up plan to ensure your results last. This step should address the initial goal of the conversation. For instance, if your goal was to make a decision, make sure there’s a date for putting the decision into action. Though it’s great to have a follow-up plan as soon as possible, your partner might need more time to think. In that case, it isn’t necessary to develop a full-scale action plan. However, you should still agree on some kind of commitment, even if that means scheduling a time to have another conversation. The key message in this book: If you want someone to change their perspective, you have to create a safe space. This way, the other person will be comfortable exploring the negative emotions that prevent them from finding solutions to difficult problems.  Actionable advice: Improve your listening by visualizing your three brains.  Many people find it difficult to use their head brain, their heart brain and their gut brain all at the same time. That’s why it’s important to practice this kind of balanced listening. To do so, take a few moments to empty your mind. Breath in and out, visualize a glowing ball floating through your brain, to your heart and then into your abdomen.

Indeed, most of us will have a tough time just remembering the mathematical concepts we were taught in high school. This is where The Economist Numbers Guide comes in handy, presenting a wide array of mathematical tools that are useful for solving complex problems in business environments. These blinks will show you how to create forecasts, how to use data to make decisions in risky and uncertain situations, and how to avoid drawing false conclusions from your data.   In these blinks, you’ll learn that two times two doesn’t always equal four; how a straight line in a chart can be very deceptive; and how fast food chains decide whether to open large or small restaurants. Basic mathematical concepts are invaluable in plenty of everyday situations. Of course, they’re vital in business situations too, but it’s important to ensure that you’re applying these concepts correctly. Take percentages. They can be applied to just about any problem involving financial growth or decline, but beware of the common traps! Suppose you’ve made an investment of $1,000, which is now worth $1,700. How much has the value increased in relative terms? Percentages will give you the answer if you first subtract the initial value from the current value –  $1700 - $1000 = $700 – then divide this difference by the beginning value and multiply by 100: ($700 ÷ $1000) × 100 = 70 percent. It seems simple enough, but beware of the typical slipups. First, remember: A percentage increase followed by the same percentage decrease does not leave you where you started; it leaves you worse off. So, if $1,000 grows by 50 percent, the sum is $1,500; however, a 50 percent loss on $1,500 would leave $750. Moreover, percentages and percentage changes are often confused. If, for instance, a growth rate increases from 10 percent to 20 percent, it has risen by ten percentage points. But the percentage change is not 10 percent – it’s 100 percent, because the growth rate has doubled. Rounding is another practical tool that can be applied incorrectly. Rounding comes in handy in day-to-day activities to simplify dealing with numbers. Values ending in four or less are rounded down, while amounts ending in five or more are rounded up. But take care to only round the numbers after making any calculations. Take the numbers 1.5 and 2.4, which both round to 2. Now, 1.5 times 1.5 is 2.25, which rounds to 2, while 2.4 times 2.4 is 5.76, which rounds to 6. So, the right answer to “two times two” could be anywhere between two and six! If you’re considering making an investment, you’ll be keen to work out how much your money will be worth in the future. You can calculate this by taking two factors into account: interest rates and inflation. Interest is the price paid for the use of money, so the calculation of interest rates is crucial when comparing investment opportunities. Suppose you invested $100 for five years at an interest rate of six percent per year. The interest earnings from your investment are then calculated as such: $100 × 5 × 0.06 = $30. You can also calculate the future value of your money, which is the initial value plus the interest earnings. So, your five-year $100 investment at six percent interest will have a future value of $130. If you consider investing $100 for five years at six percent or for three years at eight percent, you can easily calculate the future value of these two investment opportunities, making for a clear and easy comparison. We can see that the latter opportunity yields earnings of only $24, but you get your money back earlier. However, you also need to consider inflation when investing. Inflation can be seen as the opposite of interest: interest adds value, while inflation decreases it. Let’s say you want to have $10,000 in your bank account in five years. If the interest rate is six percent per year and inflation is at ten percent per year, how much money should you put into your bank account today? First, calculate the net annual rate of change by subtracting the ratio of inflation to interest rate from one: 1 - (1.10 ÷ 1.06) = -0.038, or -3.8 percent per yearr year. Then, use this rate of change to calculate the accumulated cost of inflation: $10,000 × 5 × 0.038 = $1,900. So, this means that in order to have $10,000 of current value in your account in five years, you’ll need to deposit an additional $1,900, or $11,900 in total. Let’s look at three tools that, when combined, offer a highly effective way of describing any set of related numbers. To help put them into practice, start by considering the number of sales that a real estate company makes per day. First, you need a way to measure the average or \"midpoint\" value of a set of numbers. The most common way of measuring an average is by finding the mean, which is done by adding all the scores together and dividing the sum by the number of scores. So, if our company sold one, two and three houses per day, respectively, over three days, the mean is calculated as (1 + 2 + 3) ÷ 3, which equals a mean of two sales per day. Next, we need a measure of the spread around the average. An average becomes much more meaningful when it is accompanied by an indicator of how widely the numbers are spread around it. The standard deviation is a great indicator of exactly that. You can calculate the standard deviation by first finding the mean. Then, for each number value, subtract the mean and square the result. Finally, find the mean of these squared differences and take the square root of the result. In our example, the standard deviation is one. But, if it were five or six, this would suggest that there are periods without any sales, and some days with many. Finally, we need a measure of shape. Collections of numbers can be shaped differently. This means that numbers can be distributed symmetrically around the average (1, 2 ,3), or skewed to one side (1, 2, 3000; which, incidentally, would result in an average of 1001). The most common shape for collections of random numbers is normal distribution, where the numbers are distributed symmetrically around the mean. With these three tools, it’s possible to make many different kinds of sales predictions. You’ll be even better equipped to do so when you have a way of presenting these predictions, which is exactly what the next blink will investigate. In reports and presentations, tables and charts can be instrumental in conveying your message. They can bring order to your data, while still displaying all the original information. Tables tend to serve one of two main functions, presenting data or interpreting it. Tables that present data are designed to be used by others. They should follow the rule of three: First, make tables concise and eliminate non-essential information by, for instance, rounding. Second, make tables informative by including summary amounts such as row and column totals or averages. Third, order tables in columns by importance and size – it’s easier to follow a sequence of numbers down a column than across a row. Tables designed for interpretation of data require additional information, such as percentage changes, absolute changes, totals, averages and so on. This information lets you to discover how the numbers in your data are related to each other. Unlike tables, charts allow us to summarize our data in a way that the eye can readily absorb. Trends, proportions and other relationships are revealed at a glance through line graphs, bar charts and pie charts. But making information visually accessible in this way often comes at the cost of accuracy. In fact, slight modifications in charts are frequently used to imply misleading claims. For instance, a straight line between two points on a chart can conceal a winding path between them. Say the price curve of a stock is plotted by taking its value on the first day of each month, and then simply connecting these points using straight lines. Such a chart may show stable behavior over the course of the year, but could conceal huge price fluctuations during individual months. Forecasting is all about predicting the future, especially future market trends, which is why it is a fundamental part of good decision making in business. So how is forecasting done? Let’s look at the three main approaches. The first approach is subjective forecasting, which is based on intuition, experience and guesswork. At first glance, subjective forecasting may seem inherently unreliable. But remember, a forecast is not necessarily right just because it’s based on numerical techniques. And, since forecasting techniques that work one year won’t always work the next, forecasts should always be tempered with a healthy dose of subjective managerial judgment. The second approach is the extrapolation of past trends, which, broadly speaking, refers to projecting past trends into the future. As a result, it naturally involves data sequences, or time series, such as the dollar value of ice cream sales per day, or the number of cars manufactured per month. The trick to forecasting is to reveal the trends in these time series, and to extend them into the future. The third approach is causal modeling. In this approach, predictions are based on established cause-and-effect relationships. For example, one company may base its sales predictions on advertising or prices, while another  might look at average earnings, employment and interest rate changes to predict future sales. A helpful mathematical tool for this kind of forecasting is regression analysis. This method allows you to estimate how sets of data relate to one another, such as how sales are influenced by taxes. To determine this relationship, you’ll first need to plot your data points on a graph, with sales figures on the x-axis, and tax rates on the y-axis. Regression analysis enables you to find a line that fits your plotted points best. So, this line of best fit approximates the relationship between your two sets of data, namely taxes and sales rates. Of course, none of these three methods can predict the future with certainty. But a good approach to forecasting will involve a combination of these techniques. If you took a handful of wheat seeds out of a sack, you could consider your handful to be a sample, while the entire sack would represent the parent population. Samples are used to present statistical information across many disciplines, especially in business. Working with samples can be highly effective if you take the right approach. Think of it this way: if we take consistent samples over a significant period of time, we can consider them to be representative in the long term with a certain degree of confidence. Suppose you’re running a company and want to know the average order placed by your customers out of the last 10,000 orders. Of course, you can be 100 percent sure that you reach the correct figure by examining all 10,000 invoices. Alternatively, you can be 99 percent certain that your figure is correct by sampling just 50 invoices. But how can we be so sure? If we know that a parent population of numbers is normally distributed, and we have the mean and the standard deviation at hand, we can calculate the likelihood that a sample of a certain size will behave in the same way as its parent population. So, sampling saves time and money in a wide range of business situations. Hypothesis testing also adds rigor to decision making. Say a bakery decides it won’t change its baking formula unless it can prove the hypothesis that its new dough mix is popular with at least six in ten customers. The bakery then commissions a market survey that indicates, with 99 percent confidence, that over 60 percent of consumers think the new dough is great. There is a one percent risk that the survey results are inaccurate, but such a small margin is acceptable and the bakers consequently introduce the new dough. In this way, hypothesis testing is a procedure that minimizes the risk of making the wrong decisions based on incomplete information. Many business contexts involve uncertainty or risk. Decisionmaking needs to be approached accordingly, but how exactly? Consider this example. King Burgers is planning on opening a new location. Should it open a large or small restaurant? The King family’s experience suggests that a big locale generates $500,000 in profit if popular, but incurs a $300,000 loss if not. Likewise, a small drive-through can generate $275,000 in profit or incur an $80,000 loss. If the Kings are unsure what to expect from their new market, there are four approaches. One decision-making technique is to choose the highest possible payoff. So, Optimistic King aims for the maximum profit. She builds a large restaurant that if popular will bring a $500,000 return. Another technique is to choose the lowest potential loss. In this case, even though doing nothing has zero potential payoff, it cannot generate any losses either. So, Pessimist King does nothing. A third technique is to pick the best return on average. Average King chooses this technique because she assumes that favorable markets and poor markets are equally likely. She calculates the average return for each restaurant, beginning with the large one – ($500,000 - $300,000) ÷ 2 = $100,000 – followed by the small one – ($275,000 - $80,000) ÷ 2 = $97,500. She decides to open a large restaurant since its average return would be marginally higher. One final technique is to weight the average return. Hurwicz King (named after a thoughtful mathematician) estimates that there is a 30 percent chance of a good market and a 70 percent chance of a bad market. She weights the average return by multiplying the potential profits and losses by their respective probability, and then subtracts the potential losses from the potential gains. So, (0.3 × $500,000) - (0.7 × $300,000) = $60,000 in losses for the large restaurant, and (0.3 × $275,000) - (0.7 × $80,000) = $26,500 in profit for the small one. She decides to open a small restaurant since of the two, it is the only option whose weighted average return produces a profit. The key message in this book: Forecasting trends, analyzing data and presenting your findings effectively are all made possible with a basic understanding of mathematical tools. These skills are simple yet powerful, and by mastering each one, you’ll be able to employ them with confidence to improve your decision-making abilities and your business in general.  Actionable advice: Remember the Rule of Three!  The next time you have to present any sort of business figures, remember the power that charts and tables have as tools for presenting data. If you want to make the most of your data, keep the rule of three in mind: make your tables concise, make them informative and order your numbers in columns rather than in rows. These rules will make the numbers in your table easier to comprehend.

If you want to bring your project to completion, you’ll have to motivate the unmotivated, inspire shirkers to pull their weight and deal with uncommunicative superiors who expect you to read their minds. In short, people problems are everywhere. Solving them isn’t an easy task. Today’s workplaces are more horizontal than ever before, and old-school, command-and-control management techniques are distinctly passé. That means you’ll have to tread a fine line if you want to maintain your authority without alienating your employees. Luckily, you’re not alone. World-renowned management consultant Zachary Wong has crafted the ultimate hands-on guide to navigating this hazardous terrain. Built around eight core people skills, these blinks will show you how you can start aligning individual psychology with your organization’s key objectives. Along the way, you’ll learn: why today’s businesses resemble a wedge rather than a pyramid; how to manage employees’ attitudes and why they matter; and why you should be friendly, not friends, with your team members. Whether it’s a general casting his eye over the battlefield or a manager analysing the business environment, successful leadership is all about adapting strategy to the facts on the ground. And when the facts change, it’s vital to change your approach. That also goes for project management – after all, the world of business has experienced dramatic changes in recent decades. In the old days, corporations resembled pyramids. At the top sat a small number of powerful executives. Below them were the senior managers who relayed instructions to middle managers, who, in turn, oversaw the largest and least powerful group: employees. It was a top-down model; responsibility, pay and prestige increased the further up the pyramid you went. Rising through the ranks was a steep and difficult climb. Today, that model seems increasingly passé. The idea that the workers at the base of the structure are laborers requiring an autocratic, command-and-control approach is outdated. Modern businesses are increasingly becoming more democratic structures. The contemporary workforce is more educated, skilled and tech-savvy than ever before, and employees expect to see that reflected in their roles. What they want, in other words, isn’t just a paycheck but an opportunity to realize their potential. Businesses have responded to this new reality by shifting from a pyramid model to a wedge structure. Imagine cutting a pyramid in half and laying it on its side. It now looks like a doorstop-shaped wedge with three sections interacting on a horizontal rather than a vertical axis. At the smallest end are individual contributors – employees whose unique contributions are essential to the organization’s overall success. In the middle are work teams – groups of contributors working toward a common goal. Finally, there’s management. The size of their section doesn’t reflect their absolute numbers, but rather the amount of power and resources at their disposal. This model requires project managers to play a new role. As a team leader in this structure, your job is to work fluidly between all three sections, connecting individual performance to your organization’s strategic aims. Call it organizational alignment, which is essentially about understanding the way the small details of managing relationships with individual contributors affects the success of the company as a whole. In the next blink, we’ll look at the first key skill: using the wedge model to manage performance and people problems. Today’s project managers play a vital coordinating role, and it’s your job to make sure all three sections of your company’s wedge structure are working together. So what do you do when things go wrong? Well, like a doctor, you’ll need an accurate diagnosis before you can prescribe a course of action. The wedge model is a diagnostic tool that helps you do just that. Let’s stick with our medical analogy for a second. When you visit a doctor, he’ll usually do two things: first, locate the problem – is it, say, a back or a heart problem? Second, he’ll determine whether he’s competent to treat the complaint or if he needs to refer you to a specialist. Team leaders follow a similar procedure: they find out whether a problem is an individual, team or management issue, and then they decide whether they need to make a referral. Imagine one of your team members complains to you about her colleague. She tells you that a coworker has been yelling at her and criticizing her performance. It’s gotten so bad, she adds, that she can’t complete her assignments. That’s clearly a team issue, right? Yes, but there’s also another dimension: workplace harassment is a serious legal matter. While you can take proactive steps as a team leader to limit contact between these two employees, you also need a specialist – in this case, a human resources manager. In other words, you need to wedge the problem up to management, which possesses the necessary resources and expertise to handle situations like this. What about individual employees’ problems? Although it might seem like a daunting task, there’s actually a fairly simple way of getting to the root of these problems. Call it the ERAM Model. That stands for expectations, resources, ability and motivation– the four key performance factors. To make a diagnosis, you’ll need to listen to employees’ explanations of their problems, while taking steps to independently verify their accounts. Does the individual understand your expectations and is their task clear to them? If so, do they have enough time, the right equipment and the requisite information to complete that task? How about their skills and knowledge – are they up to the job you’ve given them? Finally, are they motivated enough to get it done?  One you’ve answered those questions, it’s time for you to write a prescription: a clear and measurable action plan for improvement, which you can use to quantify progress. We’ve seen that the modern workplace emphasizes horizontal rather than hierarchical relationships. This means that boundaries between different roles are more porous, and leaders are often on friendlier terms with their subordinates than they used to be. That can put you in an awkward situation. After all, friends are equals; they do each other favors, make exceptions and let mistakes slide. But that’s the last thing you can afford to do as a leader tasked with making tough calls. So how do you square this circle? Well, it’s vital to understand that there’s a difference between friendship and friendliness. Take Robert, a project manager at a hypothetical IT firm, and Thomas, a software engineer in his team. Driving out of the company parking lot one evening, Robert comes across Thomas’s car in a ditch next to a road owned by the company. Official policy states that all accidents on the premises have to be reported and that the vehicles involved shouldn’t be moved until a report has been filed. Thomas, however, asks Robert to help him tow his car, promising he’ll fill in an official report as soon as he gets home. Team leaders face ethical quandaries like this all the time. The problem is that you can’t always be on both sides. Sometimes you have to decide whether you represent your company and its values or your employee. In this case, Thomas is clearly pushing Robert to act as his friend rather than his superior. So what should Robert do? The key here is to remember that leadership is about being friendly, not friends. Think of it this way: friendliness is a behavior rather than a relationship. Robert’s best bet, in other words, is to firmly but politely insist on sticking to the rules. That’s a great example of a key leadership attribute: being hard on policies rather than people. A true leader in Robert’s situation would be able to show that he understands Thomas’s feelings of frustration that the incident can’t be quickly resolved, while maintaining his authority as a manager. Thomas might resent Robert’s insistence on following procedure, but he can’t really complain. At the end of the day, Robert is Thomas’s superior, not his buddy. However much we might wish the case were otherwise, a company isn’t a club or a family, but a business! The most effective teams are greater than the sum of their parts. They share a sense of purpose, champion collaborative work and regularly exceed performance expectations. Whatever their differences, they all share one thing: they espouse inclusiveness. That’s all about involving employees in day-to-day processes and keeping them in the loop. Making people feel like they’re in the loop is one of the most important human factors when it comes to building successful teams. Why? Well, “the loop” is a place of safety, trust and support that makes the workplace feel like a second home. Most importantly, it fulfils a hardwired human need: the desire for a sense of purpose and acceptance. If you want to make people feel like they’re in the loop, you have to get a handle on what motivates and demotivates them. So how do you do that? Well, a good place to start is to look at different personality types. Take the 1984 book Please Understand Me by psychologists David Keirsey and Marilyn Bates, which identified four different types of personality: rationals, guardians, idealists and artisans. Identifying which of these types team members most resemble is a tool that will help you figure out the best way to motivate employees. Each type responds to distinct push and pull factors, which can either lead to disengagement or engagement. Rationals, for example, love logical tasks; they want autonomy and fear failure. Guardians are more cooperatively inclined, seeking respect and shying away from conflict. Idealists are emotional; they cherish fairness and loathe bullies. Finally, artisans are individualists who like taking risks and hate boredom. But inclusiveness isn’t something that just happens when people come together to work as a team; it’s an attitude that needs to be fostered. At its heart is the idea that the “we” is more important than the “me.” The problem is that lots of common workplace policies stand in the way of fostering genuine team spirit. For example, many of them reward individuals rather than teams. That means your role is to constantly work toward putting the team first. That can be as simple as asking all of your  team members to contribute something to the improvement of the team each month, rather than just concentrating on their individual work. Mentoring schemes, seminars or team lunches are highly effective ways of cementing the “we” spirit. As we’ve seen, people expect more from their work today than they did in the past. They don’t just want a paycheck and camaraderie – they also want job satisfaction. That’s something you’ll have to give them as a team leader, especially if you want them to go the extra mile that gives your company an edge.   To do that, you have to start managing people’s attitudes. Take the hypothetical case of Charlie, a young kid whose mom takes him to an ice cream parlor when he does well in school. One day, his mother tells him to get a napkin before eating his treat. As he reaches for it, he drops his ice cream cone. “Well,” she says, “you should’ve kept your cone up.” To Charlie, it’s the most unfair thing in the world, and he’s about to throw a tantrum. His mom, however, tells him to calm down and talk to the vendor. The vendor takes pity on Charlie and gives him another scoop for free. So what’s the lesson here? Well, there are a couple. Let’s break them down. The first is simple: everyone likes ice cream, in one form on another, when they’ve been good. That’s something a lot of employers forget. A study carried out by the American Psychological Association in 2011, for example, found that while 69 percent of employees were happy with their jobs, only 46 were happy with their employers’ recognition practices. No wonder! There’s nothing quite as de-motivating as getting “coned” – doing something good and never receiving the ice cream you feel you deserve. The simplest and most effective way of managing attitudes is to make sure you remember this lesson and reward your team’s hard work. Whether that’s a congratulatory email, a pat on the back or something more extravagant depends on the situation. What really matters is that you SCOOP your praise: make it sincere, consistent, on time, on values and personalized. The final lesson is this: good things happen when you look on the bright side – think of it as keeping your metaphorical cone up. When things go wrong, it’s a natural human reaction to want to throw in the towel. It’s inevitable that employees will mess up occasionally; the important thing is what they do next. Sometimes, you just have to be Charlie’s mom and remind them that behaving badly when bad things happen only makes things worse. Sometimes, the promise of ice cream just doesn’t work. The truth is that you’ll come across employees who shirk, whine, procrastinate, make excuses and – worst of all – claim that they’re actually doing a great job, even as they fail to hit their targets. Dealing with them will be one of your toughest tasks as a team leader. In fact, it’s so tricky that lots of managers will do anything to avoid tackling it. Why? Well, take a survey of 68 local government supervisors carried out by E. L. Perkins of the University of North Carolina in 2012. When they were asked what stopped them dealing with underperformers, 59 percent cited their fear of confrontation, 49 percent their inability to handle awkward conversations and 41 percent their unwillingness to get people in trouble. It’s a great example of the author’s maxim that people problems are like minefields – no one wants to go there. But someone eventually does have to deal with the issue. After all, you can’t reward bad behavior, and letting it go unchecked will undermine your team’s projects. Fortunately, there’s a tool you can use to get troublemakers back onside. Call it the Past-Present-Future Model. Let’s take a closer look at how it works. As the name suggests, the model consists of three stages. Let’s say an employee comes to you with a problem. He’s struggling and feeling down, which is affecting his motivation. Your job is to guide him through the problem stage by stage. Think of it like a movie: once you’ve shot a scene, you move forward. Your first scene is the past. Here, you want to practice active listening and find out about the problem. Be patient and let him tell you his story, but make sure to hold him to account by asking him to provide evidence. In the second scene, your job is to provide a diagnosis. For example, is it a resource problem or a personal issue? Next, you offer a reality check: essentially, you put the problem in context and remind the employee of the rules and regulations that apply to his situation. In the third scene, you move into the future tense. Ask the employee questions like “what can you do to improve things?” and set concrete targets, which you can both use to evaluate improvement. Do the ends justify the means? Marty thought so. He was a bullish manager hired to oversee a telecommunications company’s expansion into a new regional market. He had a gung-ho attitude to winning new contracts. A couple of years in, things were looking great: the firm was seemingly well-established and had a ton of new clients. Then came the audit. It turned out Marty’s team had been offering such generous terms to the clients in the new market that they’d basically bankrupted the new branch office. Marty’s mistake isn’t an uncommon one. In fact, companies often lose their way when a team’s behavior is poorly managed. So how can you avoid this trap? Well, a good place to start is to realize that behavior doesn’t just happen – it needs to be inspired. That has two sides: external and internal, or goals and values. Marty communicated his goal of landing new contracts very well, but he did a much worse job at telling his employees that the means were just as important as the ends. As a result, they felt free to disregard ethical guidelines and eventually bankrupted the new branch! Defining your core values and the behavior you expect from team members at the outset is the simplest way of making sure everyone’s on the same page. At the most abstract level, that means using your company’s official policies and regulations to define expected behavior. More concretely, it’s about establishing ground rules to nudge people toward adopting the right values and behavior. So if, say, tardiness is an issue and meetings are running late, you could inspire greater punctuality by asking repeat offenders to give their presentations first – a gentle nudge toward getting into the office on time. That’s a good example of the author’s emphasis on being tough on problems, not people. But simply laying down the law isn’t enough on its own; you also need to police it. That brings us to consequences. There are four types of consequential responses to behavior. The first is positive reinforcement – encouraging people to repeat their actions through praise. Next, there’s negative reinforcement – think of an email that quietly reprimands someone for being late to an appointment. Then there’s the non-response. This is used to signal that you’re happy to leave neutral issues, such as workplace clothing, to people’s own discretion. Finally, there’s punishment. This is the harshest response and reserved for clear ethical or legal offenses against company policy. Business is all about taking risks. But no matter how much time you put into analyzing the market before taking the plunge, there’s always a degree of uncertainty. That’s both normal and unavoidable, but it can also undermine effective project management. Why? Well, uncertainty generates fear and anxiety, which, in turn, affects your willingness to take the risks that are essential to success. Call it the Black Box Effect. However carefully you inspect what’s in front of you, there’s no telling what’s inside the box. It could be a trick, a trap or a treat – there’s simply no way to know before you open it. The problem, however, is that humans have a hardwired survival instinct that makes them innately cautious. That’s pretty handy when you’re out on the savannah facing down lions, but it can be a problem in the boardroom. So why’s that box so scary? There are three factors at play – call them the three uncertainties of risk-taking. The first is circumstance: when you’re weighing up a risky move, you can’t predict just how challenging it’s going to be. That brings us to the second issue: ability. If you don’t know what’s ahead of you, you tend to worry that your talents won’t be enough to handle the situation. Finally, there’s the most elemental fear: failure. This kind of fear might be natural, but that doesn’t mean you can’t push past it. That’s because risk-takers aren’t fearless – they’ve simply learned how to manage fear. Take firefighters. To do their  jobs, they have to take risks. But they’re not blasé about fire and collapsing buildings – in fact, they know better than most people just how dangerous they are. But they manage their fear by concentrating on something else: their opportunity to help people. However, firefighters don’t just turn up and hope for the best when there’s an emergency – they also train and prepare themselves for what might lie ahead. That’s something you should start doing as well. So, say you’ve been asked to give a speech, but you’re terrified of public speaking. When you think about it, there are all sorts of steps you can take to set yourself up for success. For example, you could visit the venue beforehand and familiarize yourself with the equipment you’ll be using or re-arrange the seating to encourage a more interactive Q&A session so you’re not always in the spotlight. Your role as a team leader is full of tough calls and awkward situations. Dealing with difficult employees is hard enough, but that’s nothing compared to your relationship with your boss. In this blink, we’ll take a look at one of the most important people skills you’ll ever learn: getting along with superiors. It’s a vital bit of know-how. After all, your health and happiness depend on it. Take it from a 2014 Harvard Business School survey of 20,000 employees working across a broad variety of industries. According to the survey, people who felt respected by their managers were healthier and more satisfied with their careers. Meanwhile, a 2015 Gallup survey of 7,272 American adults found that one in two had quit a job at some point to escape difficult bosses and improve their quality of life! So how can you improve your position and your relationship with your boss? Well, it’s important to realize that your relationship isn’t as one-sided as it might sometimes appear. In fact, team leaders and their superiors are mutually dependent. Sure, there’s a clear imbalance in power and resources – after all, the bosses are the ones calling the shots when it comes to funding, timing and priority-setting. But they’re also reliant on your knowledge, skill and insight to steer projects to completion. That means the imbalance in power doesn’t need to develop into an imbalance in respect, honesty and trust. Putting your relationship on a more equal footing is all about managing up. Think of it this way: while you can’t control your supervisor’s behavior, you can control your own behavior when you’re interacting with a higher-up. And the most effective thing you can do in those situations is to make yourself more visible. That means stepping up to the plate and showing what you’re all about with your actions. It can be as simple as making sure you always arrive on time for meetings, being proactive and speaking up when others don’t or going out of your way to attend optional work events, such as team drinks and seminars. Those might sound like trivial examples, but they’re actually highly effective ways of communicating your support for your boss. That kind of can-do attitude has a halo effect. Once they know you’re on their side and always ready to get involved, your superiors are much more likely to knock on your door when they have a problem or a new assignment. The key message in these blinks: Team leaders constantly run up against people problems. Whether it’s underperformers, employees pushing you to be their friend rather than their supervisor, or a tricky boss you have to deal with, project management can be a psychological minefield. But there are tools you can start using today to clear a path through this hazardous terrain. If you learn the eight key people skills for project management, you’ll be well-positioned to manage fear, boost your team’s sense of collective purpose and put the relationship with your superiors on a more equal footing.  Actionable advice: Use the 80 percent rule to keep meetings on track.  If you’ve been in a meeting recently, you know how the conversation has a natural tendency to drift at some point. The vaguer the discussion becomes, the greater the chances are that you’ll overrun your allotted time. That’s frustrating, especially when people have a ton of work waiting for them on their desks. So why not start enforcing the 80 percent rule? By the time 80 percent of the time devoted to the meeting has passed, you’ll most likely have covered the main points. So announce that you’ve reached the 80 percent mark. If there’s still a key point on the agenda, you’ll focus everyone’s minds; if there isn’t, you can end the discussion and move on to other tasks.

But given how many workplaces are still stuck in past practices, you’d be forgiven for thinking that not much has changed.  The fear-based hierarchies and motivational methods that were devised back in the Industrial Age have proven hard to get rid of. Many workplaces remain stuck in the cold, unfriendly and unproductive structure of executives barking orders and employees being afraid to speak up. However, it doesn’t have to be this way. Author Heather Hanson Wickman has a blueprint for a new, loving workplace, led by evolved executives. This is a workplace designed to adapt to the modern, fast-changing marketplace. Not only will it save you money, but it can also put you light years ahead of the competition. In these blinks you’ll learn how much productivity and money is lost to toxic workplaces; the four mindsets that lead to evolved leadership; and why you should start replacing “jobs” with “roles.” The modern workplace is in serious need of change. In his book Dying for a Paycheck, author and business theorist Jeffrey Pfeffer explains how work-related factors, such as stress and overwork, account for around 120,000 preventable deaths every year in the US. If this isn’t troubling enough, researchers at the Mayo Clinic medical center suggest that your boss has more influence over your health than your primary care physician. And yet according to Forbes, 58 percent of employees would trust complete strangers over their bosses. All of this points to the fact that we need to change the way our workplaces operate, especially since many companies have not adapted to the times. In fact, they still use the same top-down hierarchical structure that became popular during the Industrial Revolution. This strict authoritarian model, with its emphasis on efficient supervision, may have made sense for managing factory production, but the business landscape has changed dramatically since then. To see how much has changed, consider the fact that only 10 percent of businesses on the original 1955 Fortune 500 list still exist today. This has been referred to as the “Fortune 500 Disease,” but it’s really a sign of failure to adapt. Today’s thriving companies don’t operate on strict authority and supervision. Instead, they’re flexible and adaptable, and their vision matches today’s fast-changing world. If today’s businesses hope to stay ahead of the pack, they can’t afford to ignore or silence their employees by scaring them into obedience. Instead, they need to encourage their employees to speak up and reach their full innovative potential. When looking closely at traditional business models, it becomes apparent that leaders are also suffering. In the outdated model, executives take on all the responsibility and, therefore, all the pressure. They’re expected to know all the answers and fix any problems that may arise. With this burden on their shoulders, they’re bound to be racked with doubts and fears. But they won’t reveal these doubts by asking for help or advice and will shy away from innovative ideas, for fear of being challenged or losing their jobs if things don’t work out. Today’s businesses need to encourage adaptability and risk-taking from their leaders if they hope to have lasting success. In the next blink, we’ll look at how leaders can evolve. As we saw in the previous blink, fear played a big role in the traditional hierarchical structure, as both employees and executives would suppress unconventional ideas for fear of repercussion. Some may hold onto old ideas of fear being a useful motivator, but the truth is that fear is an inefficient and toxic form of management. Back in the early industrial days, fear was deemed useful since it meant that employees knew their place and wouldn’t dare challenge their bosses. Indeed, in this environment, there was little else to motivate people aside from the fear of losing their jobs or being disciplined by a superior.  But these days we know better. The first problem is that fear-based motivation is dependent on keeping fear ever-present, because once it’s gone, so is the desire to remain obedient. Perhaps even more problematic is the detrimental behaviors that fear encourages, such as being secretive, blaming others for your mistakes and never saying no to your boss. These habits not only create a toxic work environment, they undermine the entire company. Current studies show just how harmful a poor work environment can be to employee motivation and productivity. A 2016 Gallup survey found that only 13 percent of employees are engaged with their work if conditions are poor, while 24 percent will be actively looking for ways to quit. A 2005 US Department of Labor study also found that toxic work environments can lead to high rates of absenteeism, which includes calling in sick and going on leave for depression. The cost of absenteeism can add up quickly. In fact, the study revealed it can account for up to 22 percent of a company’s total payroll. And a 2017 Gallup survey of US businesses showed that disengaged employees can deplete companies of up to 17 percent of their productivity. To counteract the fear that leads to toxic workplaces, we must therefore start leading with love. Instead of encouraging a fearful workplace characterized by cutthroat competition and undermining each other, leaders should encourage freedom and autonomy. Executives must forge genuine connections with their teams and shouldn’t be afraid to show compassion for their employees.  Above all, leaders should be authentic and unafraid to show their true selves. By doing so, they’ll inspire others to do the same. So how do you topple the mentality of leading with fear, and start leading with love? To paraphrase the wise words of Mahatma Gandhi, you must demonstrate the change you want to see in the world. In other words, if you hope to change the way your business works, you must first change yourself. True change isn’t about appearances and behavior. Rather, it’s about questioning and revising your core beliefs. For example, if you’re continually taking on too much work, you may want to learn how to say no more often. It may be tempting to think of this as a simple behavioral change: you just need to start saying no instead of yes. But this won’t change the fundamental issue of why you find it hard to say no. For this you need to go deeper into your core beliefs. Until you do so, saying no will continue to cause you emotional pain.  You can think of core beliefs as your operating system, since they’re responsible for more than just your behavior – they also dictate your perception of others and how you generally think about things. When your core beliefs are rooted in fear, it stands to reason that you’ll see threats everywhere you look. And when your perception is that you’re always under attack, you’ll always be defensive rather than proactive. Now, you may be thinking that you don’t really know what your current beliefs are. This means that you need to increase your self-awareness. Increased self-awareness falls under the category of heart learning, or vertical learning, as opposed to head learning, or horizontal learning. An example of horizontal learning would be acquiring a specific skill, like learning how to create an interactive spreadsheet. Vertical learning is about becoming more emotionally intelligent and self-aware, so that you can adjust your core beliefs. Vertical learning is an important part of being able to adapt yourself and your workplace to an ever-changing business world. In the next blink, we’ll go further into vertical learning and explain how you can become better at it. Most professionals are familiar with the idea of “climbing the corporate ladder,” but the evolved leader must work toward a more personal kind of ascension. In order to evolve, you must understand what needs changing, which means increasing your self-awareness and your ability to understand who you truly are. All of this is made possible by vertical learning. To put it another way, vertical learning is about increasing your consciousness. Author Caroline Myss has written best-selling books about human consciousness, and she makes the analogy that your consciousness is like the multiple floors of an apartment building. As you make your way to the top floor you’re better able to understand your view of the world and see more of who you truly are. When you’re starting out on the bottom floor, all you’ll see is the fence around the building. As you get past the middle floor, you’ll start to see past the surrounding trees, and as you reach the top, you’ll begin to take in the vast ocean and the unlimited horizon beyond it. It’s not easy to get to the top, but it’s worth it to gain new insights and better understand not only yourself, but also loved ones and those you work with. To help you along the way there are four key mindsets you should know about. First is the connection mindset. Even though we all have a fundamental need to connect with others, we tend to keep to ourselves at work, for fear of being taken advantage of or getting metaphorically stabbed in the back. This is a fear-based reaction, so becoming an evolved leader means replacing that fear with authenticity and creating a workplace that encourages connection. Next is a growth mindset. This is the recognition that no individual’s behaviors, habits or skills are set in stone. The evolved leader understands that, while it might be difficult, people can grow and change. Then there’s the trust mindset. This is about accepting that uncertainty is part of life and business. While the notion of certainty is comforting, progress was never made by those who strove for certainty above all else. Instead, evolved leaders must trust in themselves and their teams, while embracing uncertainty and exploring new ways of doing business. Finally, we have the purpose mindset. With this mindset, the evolved leader recognizes that purpose, not profit, is the better reason for doing business. If you’re struggling to recognize your purpose, a common piece of advice is to consider what gets you out of bed in the morning. But Mark Manson, the author of The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck, poses a more pointed question: “What makes you forget to eat and poop?” If you’re so absorbed by something that you neglect your own body, that’s probably something you’re pretty passionate about. If you’re still unclear about your purpose, here are four steps that should be able to help you with that: Step one is to tell your story. Go back into the memory bank and recount the key events in your life. Include the tragic moments as well as the joyous ones. As you’re recalling these events, pay attention to any recurring themes that might tie these moments together. For example, you may realize that many of your fondest memories involve mentoring someone. Step two is to start paying more attention to the feedback you get from other people. You may want to ask the people closest to you what they think your purpose is. Oftentimes, others are better at seeing what’s under your own nose. Step three involves taking everything you’ve gathered so far and whittling it down to no more than five key themes. The fourth and final step is to take what you’ve learned, including your life’s themes, and write a guiding statement - in other words, your purpose. For the author, this was: “To awaken the souls of leaders so we can create soulful organizations.” If it still feels like you’re lacking personal insight, try practicing mindfulness, a form of meditation intended to give you the space and time needed to be and not do. A routine meditation practice can be an essential part of your personal growth, as it provides regular moments of peaceful rest that can free your mind from being cluttered with competing thoughts. When you gain this freedom, you’ll find it easier to dive deeper inward and gain that personal insight. Mindfulness is a good place to start since it doesn’t necessarily require rigorous meditation. For instance, you can practice mindfulness on a daily walk through the park by focusing on the sounds that are around you, like birdsong, insects and rustling leaves. Let’s say you’ve looked inward, found your purpose and realigned your core beliefs away from fear toward a leadership motivated by love. Now it’s time to change your workplace. If you were to urge a workforce governed by fear to start being more creative, the results wouldn’t be good. If your employees harbor a fear of failure, it won’t matter how much you promote innovation, as no one will feel safe enough to try. Therefore, it doesn’t matter if you replace managers or department heads with people who encourage creativity. What needs changing is the company culture. A company culture is about more than casual Fridays or the ping-pong tables and hammocks you find in the offices of Silicon Valley start-ups. Essentially, company culture is defined by how people communicate and treat one another as well as how they regard their jobs. It’s about trust, honesty and purpose – the core dynamics that determine how people do things and how they feel about what they do. Since the company culture determines how motivated and engaged your employees are, it needs to be treated with care. If the company culture is one of fear, you end up with disengaged and absent employees who are afraid to innovate. When the company culture is one of love, it promotes communication that is open and transparent, and it encourages and rewards active, innovative collaboration. If you’re unsure of how healthy your existing company culture is, ask yourself these questions: How do people interact? What methods are used in the communication between leaders and employees? Is the atmosphere in meetings engaged or fearful? More subtle clues can be found in the company’s physical appearance, so pay attention to whether the offices are clearly separated according to hierarchy. Are the executives to one side in bigger offices, with everyone else on the other side in small cubicles? Do the leaders appear elusive by staying behind closed doors with blinds shut? Finally, pay attention to how administrative staff like secretaries and receptionists are treated. Are they ignored when the time comes for a company retreat, or are they included? Oftentimes, poor treatment of support staff is a sure sign of an overall toxic culture. When you lead from a place of love and empathy, your team will eventually do the same, all the way down to the last employee. Changing the company culture is a big first step for a healthier workplace, but to make lasting changes, you’ll also need to transform your company structure. A great start is to bring your departments closer together. In most traditional structures, each department acts as an independent entity. Marketing will rarely confer with the engineering team and so on. When departments are isolated from one another, there’s a good chance their work will not be as joined-up as it could be. One structural change that can help unify your company and promote harmony is to establish lead links within each department. A lead link is an employee entrusted with the additional role of serving as a conduit between various departments, making sure all communication and information flows freely. This way, each department will be aware and can stay aligned with the company’s bigger picture. And you can rest assured that when it’s time to adapt, everyone will be on the same page. Another effective structural change is to turn your company into a network of teams. In this structure, employees are given the autonomy to form or disband into any number of teams they see fit in order to take care of clients and whatever projects are on the table. As such, teams are responsible for designating or not designating a leader, as well as doing their own recruiting, sales and marketing, depending on what the project calls for. This also means that employees can be part of multiple teams at any given time. There are pluses and minuses to this arrangement. On the plus side, it’s highly collaborative, promotes open communication and can make employees feel empowered and motivated. Being this flexible also means you’ll be in a good position to adapt to whatever changes the marketplace demands. However, evaluating performances in this structure can be tricky since the teams are counted on to self-manage. Plus, this level of autonomy means that employees must be self-motivated and capable of taking responsibility for their own problems, which is asking more than some can deliver. Nevertheless, in the author’s experience, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. Before you make sweeping changes, you may want to experiment with just a couple of departments by giving them the power to run their own teams and make their own decisions. This way you can see what works and what adjustments need to happen before going big. Once you’ve made your structural changes, you’ll want to take steps to ensure that your newly transparent and collaborative organization runs smoothly. This is where a new set of company practices comes in. For starters, when you move away from traditional structures, it also makes sense to get rid of traditional job titles and descriptions. Switching to roles, which are more fluid and adaptable, is a good way to reaffirm the spirit of your new workplace. Traditional jobs and strict job descriptions are not well suited for change. Each responsibility is written into a contract, and trying to make changes to it can be an arduous process. Many leaders also know the frustration of asking someone to do something different only to be told “that’s not my job.” By switching to roles, you can make sure your workforce is flexible and in a good position to adapt to whatever may arise. With open conversation and problem-solving, roles can be cooperatively defined, agreed upon and even temporarily shared with other employees.  The point is, you can create roles to suit the current needs of the company. And if that means people need to take on different roles at different times, then why not have that be your company practice? By using roles, you may find that your employees become more adaptable, collaborative and engaged. Another practice that you may benefit from abolishing is having all the big decisions coming from a higher authority. It can be problematic to expect one leader to come up with the answers to every problem. Often, they’re not the ones on the front line with the pertinent information or even the relevant expertise. That’s why many companies have benefitted from installing an advice process. It works like this: an employee recognizes a problem, consults with other team members, drafts a proposal and discusses that proposal with the team. If it’s agreed, the team will then implement the action themselves.  If this level of autonomy isn’t in place, the team member could consult with a manager for approval before the action is implemented. Employees are thus empowered to do something about a problem before it escalates. This not only leads to better decisions, but it also strengthens teams and encourages open communication by making the act of seeking advice part of the process. Now that you have a good idea of what an evolved workplace entails, let’s get a better sense of what it looks like in action through a couple of case studies. Scribe is a publishing company based in Austin, Texas, with a revolutionary way of producing nonfiction books. Basically, they mentor would-be writers from the very start of the process, as book ideas are formed, all the way to the final publishing. As part of this process, Scribe has practices in place that highlight just how evolved the company is, such as the Whole Self Program, which promotes personal growth and collaboration. Every six months, during a company offsite, all the employees get together to discuss the growth potential of one employee, usually a newer hire. The discussion starts with a supportive and honest review of the teammate’s strengths, as well as whatever may be standing in the way of her growth. Then, after the employee has shared her goals for the year ahead, she’ll be assigned a mentor within the group who will help to make sure those goals are reached. This program has been so embraced by employees that mentorships have been formed outside of these biannual meetings. Then there’s Percolab, a design and innovation consultancy with a very evolved way of promoting transparency. As we’ve seen in the previous blinks, transparency and open communication are vital parts of a healthy culture, and key components in being able to move away from a fearful workplace. Transparency promotes trust, honesty and collaboration – and it also requires it. When some companies talk about their transparency, they’re referring to their ownership, finances or customer service, but Percolab takes it a step further by having what they call Open Team Meetings. In these meetings, literally anyone can join in – from the spouses of employees to complete strangers. During these meetings, attendees may overhear all kinds of sensitive information, including company strategies and financial details. This may sound bizarre, but the genius of Open Team Meetings is that in return for their transparency, Percolab gains valuable insights from these outsiders, since they can offer a fresh perspective on whatever the topic of the day may be. Plus, the folks at Percolab are following Gandhi's sage advice by demonstrating the change they want to see, and striving for a world where trust abounds and all businesses and governments practice radical transparency. The key message in these blinks: These days, we need evolved executives who promote the kind of modern workplaces that can thrive and adapt to an ever-changing world. We need to get rid of the traditional hierarchies that use fear-based motivation, which only ends up harming employees and companies. This kind of change must start with executives, who can improve company culture and then establish more modern, adaptable and transparent workplace structures. The evolved workplace is one that uses trust and open collaboration to gain the competitive advantage. Actionable advice: When trying to change a fearful habit, imagine doing the exact opposite. If you work in a fearful environment, you may be afraid to speak up when you don’t agree with someone’s decision. So the next time that happens, imagine doing the exact opposite and speaking up against the people you disagree with. When you picture this, ask yourself: What exactly are the fears I associate with doing this? Or, what assumption is fuelling this fear? Is it that people won’t like me if I disagree with them? Questions like these should lead you to the core belief that is really at the root of your behavior.  In this case, you may be assuming that how much someone likes you depends on how much you agree with them. Now you can work on changing this core belief and make a lasting change to your behavior. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Drucker","summary":"They say that one sign of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again while expecting different results, and this is exactly why a lot of organizations struggle – they go about their business as usual while wondering why they don’t see any growth or positive changes. What struggling organizations need to do is ask the tough questions. Author Peter F. Drucker has narrowed things down to the five most important questions. By asking yourself these five questions, and answering honestly, you’ll soon have a much better understanding of what’s working, what’s not and what needs to be done to get on the right track. While Drucker’s expertise focuses on non-profit organizations, these questions will help any executive, manager or small business owner get a better sense of what’s really important. In these blinks, you’ll discover how an ER mission statement revitalized its effectiveness; how a school has far more customers than you may think; and what a museum can teach you about having flexible action plans. If you’re the leader or manager of any sort of organization, there are five questions that you should ask yourself if you want your organization to be the best that it can. The first question is “What is our mission?” It’s the number one question because it identifies the objectives and goals that you and your organization are aiming to fulfill. The answer to the question is no less than the primary reason for your organization’s existence, and therefore it will be the guiding force and the common bond that holds your organization together. Given how important your mission statement is, you should take care to make sure it accurately reflects the commitment, ability and hope of the organization. However, the statement should still be both accurate and concise enough to fit on a t-shirt. While consulting at a hospital, Drucker was tasked with helping administrators come up with a new mission statement for the emergency room (ER). Their first attempt was “Our mission is health care.” However, it became apparent that the ER wasn’t caring for health as much as it was caring for illness. They also wanted to recognize the fact that in eight out of ten cases the job of the ER staff was to tell patients their problems could be solved by a good night’s sleep. With these considerations in mind, the mission statement became “To give assurance to the afflicted.” Immediately, the hospital found that this mission helped ER staff re-evaluate their priorities, and the patients began to be seen much quicker. A strong mission statement can also help your organization adapt to a changing world, while not losing sight of its core objectives. In every organization, there can come a time when your principles need to be fixed. To do this, you need to separate the flexible elements from those that are non-negotiable. Take a modern church, for instance. If a church is to endure, it needs to recognize that people, and how they worship, change over time. Yet for the most part, the mission or ideology of a religion is non-negotiable. Likewise, the mission of the international scientific community isn’t going to change much, even when old theories are replaced by new ones. No matter what, the core mission remains the same – the advancement of human knowledge. Last but not least, a strong mission can help you decide whether an opportunity is right for you. The Girl Scouts of the USA’s mission is “To help a girl reach her highest potential.” When it was offered a lucrative deal to canvas for a charity organization, the management declined as the opportunity would not help the girls to reach their potential. Knowing your typical customer is key to any business’s success. As an executive at Ford Motors once said, “If we’re not customer driven, our cars won’t be either.” Therefore, the second question for a successful organization is “Who is our customer?” In answering this question, you should be careful to distinguish between your primary customers and supporting customers; so that you’re focusing on the primary while making sure the supporting aren’t neglected. A primary customer is one whose life is directly changed by your product or service. The author once consulted for a mid-sized non-profit with the mission “To increase people’s economic and social independence.” They defined their primary customer as someone “with multiple barriers to employment.” This was a good definition, since it could apply to a range of people with different circumstances, yet was still very clear. A supporting customer is someone who you want to satisfy, but isn’t the focus of your mission. In the case of the non-profit organization, their supporting customers could be local businesses as well as the family members and those caring for their primary customers. All of these customers can significantly help the organization to achieve its mission. Another reason to know your customers is to be aware of how your business is affected when they change. By knowing your customer, you’re able to recognize when you’re reaching a whole different group of people. This is what happened to a pastor that the author knew: The pastor launched a program at his church aimed at helping newlyweds. Imagine his surprise when the only people who showed up were cohabiting, unmarried couples unsure about marriage. By knowing your target audience, you’ll be sure to recognize when others are being unexpectedly attracted to your product. Also keep in mind that the world is continually shifting – if a completely different audience is taking over, you’ll have to know when it’s time to evolve alongside your customer base while staying true to the mission that’s helped you succeed. The next question is one that gets ignored more than all others, yet it’s essential for every organization: “What does our customer value?” By asking this question, you can avoid the pitfall of assuming what your customer wants, and instead get valuable feedback directly. When you have a deep understanding of your primary customer’s values, you’ll be in a position to maximize your ability to satisfy your customers’ needs. For example, when a homeless shelter discovered the values of their primary customers, it led to profound changes in the values they placed on food and bedding. The organization conducted a series of face-to-face customer interviews which revealed that, while food and clean beds were appreciated, they ranked almost zero compared to satisfying the customers’ primary need: not to be homeless. As a result, the staff put more time and resources into working alongside their customers to help them achieve their goal. This included extending how long they allowed people to stay at the shelter. By making the period longer, it helped to create a safer, more home-like environment. This question also changed the way the Sinai-Grace Hospital operated. When Patricia Maryland was hired as the hospital’s new president, she learned that it was known in the community as the “dirty hospital,” and patients were unhappy with how long they had to wait for service. With this customer feedback, Maryland knew what needed to be changed, and she led a massive reorganization of how the hospital was run. This included dividing the ER into separate areas for urgent care and patients with chest pain – reducing the wait time by 75 percent. Maryland also oversaw a complete refurbishment of the hospital to erase its “dirty” public perception. Through these customer-driven changes, the hospital was finally able to turn into a successful money-making institution. When asking this question about customer value, it’s important not to forget about the opinions of your supporting customers. For the principal of a school, this means taking care of the primary customer – the student – while not ignoring the many secondary customers, including teachers, the school board, community partners and parents. Each requires attention to make sure the teachers don’t go on strike, or the school board doesn’t fire the principal. In fact, only by satisfying the supporting customers’ needs can the principal make sure the school is well-run and that the students receive a high-quality education. With the mission defined and customers understood, it’s time to ask the next question. The role of good leadership is to know what needs to be fixed to achieve the organization’s mission. This means keeping a keen eye on performance and how it measures up against criteria. For this to happen, you need to ask the fourth question: “What are our results?” In focusing your attention on results, it’s important to recognize that long-term success often comes from short-term accomplishments. When thinking of the results you hope to achieve, make sure to think both long and short-term. The staff of a small, family-run mental health center defined its mission as “To enable the recovery of people with serious and persistent mental illness.” Not only did they judge their results against the ultimate goal of recovery, but they judged all the small steps it took for a patient to get there. This meant checking in on how many group sessions the patients were attending, whether there was a reduction of hospitalization and if there was an improvement in how well participants understood their conditions. All this helped the institution understand which programs were working and which needed refinement, so that more patients could return to a stable family life and a steady job. When looking at results, you should pay attention to both the qualitative and quantitative. Qualitative results are about subjective, non-numerical information that can help you understand your customers’ experiences. For the education director at a major museum, one great qualitative result was being told by a man that the museum had changed his life by opening up his teenage mind to a new world of possibilities. This inspired a new initiative at the museum to bring in more at-risk teenagers. Quantitative results, on the other hand, focus on statistics and numerical data. For many businesses, profit and earnings speak the strongest. But for a non-profit organization, the important numbers might also include the percentage of welfare recipients who gain employment after completing the company’s job training program, or whether child abuse rates fell after introducing 24-hour crisis care. These measures provide a clear understanding of the effectiveness of your organization and the difference it’s making. Appraising your performance will also help you with the last question. The final question every organization needs to ask is “What is our plan?” Any good plan should take into account all the important things, including your mission, vision, goals, objectives, action steps, budget and results. Planning should also include the uncertainty of the current business climate, define the specific place you want to take your organization and how you intend to get there. An effective plan should lay out your overarching goals in a way that translates into concrete steps – in turn leading to specific objectives. So, what kind of goals should you set for yourself? A smart set of goals should correspond to your desired future, and describe the long-range direction you need to take to get there. However, an effective plan shouldn’t have more than five goals; otherwise your attention and efforts will be spread too thin. Let’s look at a museum: A smart set of goals would align with their mission of bringing art and people together. Four goals for the museum might be: to seek and acquire exceptional works of art, to preserve collections and inspire partnerships, to grow the museum’s audience and strengthen bonds with members both new and old and to achieve long-term financial security. Once you have goals, they need to be turned into objectives – preferably ones that contain measurable action steps allowing you to clearly chart your progress. For instance, the museum’s goal of growing their audience can turn into the objective of increasing memberships by ten percent. Now you can create action steps leading to achieve this, such as offering discounted membership gift packs during the upcoming holidays. Plans, goals and action steps shouldn’t be written in stone. In fact, you should keep tabs on the effectiveness of your plan through regular performance appraisals, and if things aren’t going well, you should adjust your plan accordingly. Perhaps circumstances have changed, or new information has come to light about the marketplace or your target customers. Or maybe you’ve just found a better process, like focusing on sales through your website. Let’s say the museum starts a new exhibition, and it quickly becomes apparent that this is attracting high numbers of first-time visitors. This is an unexpected opportunity to turn these new visitors into subscribing members. Even though it wasn’t part of the original plan, your organization should be flexible enough to divert resources into this new strategy. Now that you know the five questions, it’s time to start putting them to work for you and your organization. The key message in these blinks: To truly bring success to your organization, you need to ask yourself the following five questions: What is our mission? Who is our customer? What does the customer value? What are our results? What is our plan? Actionable advice: Look to other successful organizations. Next time you hear about a successful organization, think about what makes them successful. What is their mission? Do they have a deep understanding of what their customers value? Work through the five questions to get a better understanding where their success comes from. Got feedback?  We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Chess, football, maybe tag, and playing cards? A set of rules, points to be scored and opponents to challenge? Structure and mental and emotional engagement? Couldn’t you use those qualities for more than a family Monopoly session? Gamification takes winning to another level. Companies use game designs to increase customer loyalty or staff engagement, engineering game play to transform the way they do business. The Gamification Revolution explains many different kinds of games, and how they can be used not just to engage with customers, but also to invigorate new employees or strategy meetings inside your organization. After reading these blinks, you’ll know why the architecture industry is so obsessed with games; how Nike uses games to train new employees; and how to introduce gamification into your company or organization. What’s your favorite game? Is it a board game or a computer game? Have you ever stopped to think about how many games there are, and how often we play them? You’re probably familiar with games like chess or Angry Birds, but what about gamification games? Gamification means using games to get people together or solve problems. It’s widespread, and it can be very useful. The annual McDonald's Monopoly game is an example of gamification. Customers are rewarded with Monopoly pieces every time they buy food or drinks. To get more obscure pieces and complete a set, they have to order bigger meals or visit more branches. Gamification works by leveraging behavioral economics and design. Just think about all the situations where we collect points, where badges represent achievements, levels give us a rank, and leaderboards and scoreboards show how we compare with others. Then there are grand challenges, which aim to solve specific problems. They’re usually highly publicized and offer prizes to the winners. Sometimes they can lead to great discoveries or inventions. In fact, a grand challenge led to the establishment of our system of longitude in 1714. Gamification provides great opportunities for businesses and other organizations. It can even be critical for them. Games can help you invigorate your brand, engage with customers and raise profits – just like the McDonald’s Monopoly. They can also inspire innovation and creativity within your company. The main thing that makes games essential, however, is their ubiquity. A study by TNS Global found that over 60 percent of people in the Western world regularly play computer or video games. This is even more true for young people: about 70 percent of toddlers and young kids play them! So if you want to connect with people in our modern world, you’ve got to do it through means that you know will hook them in: games. Gamification isn’t just about designing fun games. It’s also about relating to your customers in new ways, and ensuring they use whatever you’re putting out there. This is the biggest advantage of gamification: it engages people. So what does that mean for a company? Well, gamification allows you to respond directly to your customers’ desires and needs. It lets you connect with them on a new level. For example, young people today are driving less and less, as they prefer to take public transit (where they can play games on their phones!) Ford and Nissan have addressed this issue by gamifying their cars. Ford created a virtual plant for the dashboard display that acts like a digital pet – it turns green when the driver conserves gas. Nissan lets their drivers connect to Facebook, so they can compete with each other over who’s the safest and most eco-friendly driver. These strategies allow Ford and Nissan to engage with young people, especially those who don’t want to drive for environmental reasons. Games let you give customers what they want, so they provide for you in return. The rapper Chamillionaire did this by creating a gamified community called the “Chamillitary.” Fans in the Chamillitary compete to be Chamillionaire’s number one fan. They can collect points to redeem for merchandise, special events or things they can show off to their friends, like a personal voice mail from Chamillionaire. The Chamillitary is essentially a loyalty program where you buy something then get points that encourage you to buy something else. It has a more important function for Chamillionaire, however: it allows him to release music and merchandise, and reach out to his fans without having to rely on a record label’s marketing department. He and his fans use games to help each other. So how can gamification make a difference inside your company? The first step is to gamify your strategy. Games can engage your employees just like they engage your customers. Games can help you think about what might happen in the future, or “end game.” Alternative Reality Games (ARG) are great for this. ARGs encourage participants to anticipate future problems or situations. One ARG, for instance, was a 32-day simulation that explored what would happen if there was no oil for 32 weeks (each day represented a week). 18,000 people participated. In the simulation, gas rose to $7 per gallon, two million people lost jobs, and cities suffered major damage from riots and migrants. Games can also help you plot for future eventualities, as in scenario planning. In scenario planning, people go through a step-by-step process outlining what the other side would do in certain situations. It allows you to assess possible outcomes, and it’s especially useful for negotiations. In fact, since 2007, every US Army officer has taken game-based training for negotiation. Through scenario planning, the bond company PIMCO was able to predict that Lehman Brothers would collapse. Standard quantitative models didn’t predict it, but PIMCO’s models did. You can also use gamestorming, which is gamified brainstorming. It fosters more enthusiasm and engagement. Use the 3-12-2 game for gamestorming. First, you introduce a problem, and players have three minutes to write down aspects of the problem on index cards. Next, assemble the players in pairs, each of which gets 12 minutes to go through the index cards and brainstorm solutions. Finally, each pair gets two minutes to pitch their idea. The 3-12-2 game inspires players to be creative and work together under clear time constraints – to the benefit of your organization. Games come in many different shapes and sizes, and we’ve seen how they help people work. If you gamify your employees’ experiences, you can motivate them and improve their performance. Even dull or dreary tasks can be spiced up with games. Nike tech reps, for example, go through a nine day camp where they live the history of Nike. It’s called “Ekin,” which is “Nike” backward. Ekin participants run on the original tracks the Nike founders used, and they hold the waffle rubber shoe soles that were Nike’s first product. This increases the camaraderie between staff members, and teaches them the company’s history. It also lets them interact with their own products in a meaningful way. The real goal of Ekin is to make the employees excited about the brand, so they can excite the consumers in turn. In the end, they transfer their enthusiasm and joy of running to the customers. Target also motivated their employees by creating a “checkout game” for cashiers who were bored by their monotonous work. They made a simple system that rates how fast the cashiers are checking people out, and told them to aim for 82 percent. The screen notifies the cashier if they’re swiping too slowly, or at the desired rate. The purpose of the game is to give the cashiers a sense of control as they do their repetitive task. The low-stakes competitive element also gives them a feeling of accomplishment. This is especially important because of agency – the feeling that you control your own destiny. The World Health Organization has reported that a lack of agency is one of the most common stressors at work. Instead of creating flashy graphics or rewards, Target offered its employees instant feedback and a goal to reach. It motivates cashiers, and helps them work better without having an annoying manager peering over their shoulder. Nothing works better than games when it comes to innovation. But how? There are three main ways to gamify corporate innovation. First, you can use marketplaces and competitions to generate feedback or ideas. The United Kingdom's Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), for example, has “Idea Street” – a game that’s like a stock market. Employees suggest ideas, which work like stocks. They use virtual currency to “buy” or support them. Idea Street allows the management to see what proposals the employees value most. It saved DWP $16 million in its first nine months alone, at virtually no cost to the organization. You can also hold competitions for designs or other ideas, and award prizes to the winners. This will bring in much more creativity than coming up with ideas internally. The architecture industry utilizes this strategy often. The designs of many global landmarks, such as London’s Olympic Legacy Park and the Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art, were submitted in competitions. The next way to gamify corporate innovation is through simulations. Marketplaces seldom inspire innovation because they’re too complex, but simulations can. The IT consultancy NTT Data, for instance, has a simulation game called “Go Leadership.” It tests consultants by giving them difficult challenges and hypothetical scenarios to work through. Go Leadership led to another innovation simulation called “Go Platform.” In Go Platform, specific client needs are simulated, allowing consultants to train by responding to them. You load a client into the game, then play out the possible situations you’ll have to deal with – it could be a system meltdown, cash flow pressure, or something else. Finally, just playing can inspire innovation and creativity. Playtime isn’t just for kids! Playing lowers our stress, which hurts innovation and leads to burnout. It creates space in your head where you can be creative. This is why you can find Xboxes, pool tables and other games at almost every successful company in Silicon Valley these days. In fact, Google employees famously use 20 percent of their work time to work on – or play with –  their own creative projects. This is how Google developed Gmail. Games can help save money and time even in the nitty gritty aspects of corporate life, like recruitment and training. Gamified recruitment saves money and attracts ideal candidates. Google did this when they put a billboard in Silicon Valley that read, “{first 10-digit prime found in consecutive digits of e}.com.” The ad didn’t even mention Google. The answer to the puzzle was a website: 74727466291.com. On the site, there was another math problem, and if you solved that one, you could apply for a job at Google. Google didn’t have to hire headhunters or spend months going through resumés when they used this game. It naturally attracted the people they wanted, and filtered out those who were unfit for the job. Games can also speed up training and improve people’s performance. Training is necessary, but it’s usually costly. It can also be dull, depending on the topic and presenter. Trainees won’t benefit much if their training is uninteresting. They’re much less likely to remember what they’ve learned. Daiichi Sankyo, a Japanese pharmaceutical company, addressed this problem by creating a “critter-killer game” to teach its young sales force the complicated, scientific details of a new diabetes treatment – details that would probably be boring otherwise. In the game, employees used avatars to chase pesky animals, and they were presented with facts on the new drug every time they shot an offender. After memorizing the facts, they could trade them for ammunition or points. This was much more effective than giving stacks of boring documents to the employees, and asking them to memorize the information. Games can help both the company and its employees. Social media outlets like Twitter and Facebook have massively impacted our society, and they provide great opportunities for businesses to engage with customers – especially through games. Games can separate you from your competitors, and help promote your brand. Games encourage customers to share their experiences with your product. This made the difference between Foursquare and another location check-in company that preceded it, Dodgeball. Dodgeball allowed you to check in at places and show your friends. Foursquare, however, lets its users play games with their check-ins. Foursquare gamified its check-ins by dubbing people who check in more at particular places “mayors.” Users can also earn badges. This way, people don’t get tired of telling others where they are, and sharing their check-ins on Facebook or Twitter. Some great badges include “The Last Degree Badge” for the first people to check in at the North Pole, and the “Player Please” badge for checking into a place with three or more members of the opposite sex. Users are motivated to keep using the service to get more badges. Foursquare has enjoyed great success. Dodgeball, on the other hand, shut down after just a few years. Games that use social media also allow you to tell your brand’s story. Nike’s “Nike+” is an example of this. It has a chip you can put into your shoes to measure your running. Nike+ then records the details, like distance, time and route. Users can track their accomplishments with it. Nike+ users can also publish their stats online through social media sites. They can challenge their friends, see their work and congratulate each other. Nike+ isn’t just a fun game either – it also expresses Nike’s branding goal of achieving joy through running. The key message in this book: People are motivated by games, and games have far more to offer than a few minutes’ fun. Companies need to implement gamification to keep ahead in our modern world. They can help you in every area from strategy building to recruitment and customer engagement. Actionable advice: Let your employees play. Games aren’t just for your customers – they’re equally important inside the company. There’s a reason that Google keeps Xboxes around for their staff to play. When your employees can relax and play a bit, they’ll not only be happier, but more creative and productive too.

So how can we deal with this brave new world? And how will our businesses thrive on the effects of future developments? The Gen Z Effect is what happens when technology is used to unite rather than divide generations, and so Generation Z isn’t a demographic construct, but a set of generation-crossing behaviors shaped by the newest technology. You will learn about the mind-set, behaviors and forces that are Gen Z, and discover how they can affect the future of business.  In these blinks you’ll also find that 15 generations could be living alongside one another by 2080; that offices might soon be a thing of the past; and why young tech-savvies can be a company’s most valuable asset. We had the baby boomers and Generation X. So what’s next? A generation truly unlike anything that came before it: Generation Z. But before diving into what today’s kids mean for our future, let’s take a closer look at how generations have shaped our recent history.  Every generation has its own character, defined by the conditions they faced growing up. While a young person coming of age in the 1940s faced the terrors of the Second World War, the following generation – the Boomers – grew up in a society that strove for peace. Some issues, such as terrorism and economic crisis, may bridge generations.  Yet until now, generational differences have created well-known divides between demographics. And it’s not just a matter of you disagreeing with your parents. Research by the authors reveals that innovative thinking in companies is often hindered by the tension between old and new.  However, workplaces that are divided by generational differences simply won’t survive in the years to come. Why? Because the next generation is a different one altogether, with six driving forces that give it the potential to reach incredible success – if we can learn to adapt. Generation Z. It’s been described as the last real generation, but why? Well, because generational differences such as those that separated Generations X and Y may soon cease to exist altogether.  For some, using objects made of metal, plastic and glass to order groceries or meet people is quite novel. But for members of Generation Z, they’re just mundane activities that don’t require a second thought.  Generation Z is characterized by the ever-increasing use of technology in everyday life. And these conditions have given rise to a new attitude that we can describe as openness to progression, and a willingness to adapt. This is what we call the Gen Z effect. So why does it matter? Well, technology isn’t the only thing that’s changing our world. Life expectancy is also on the rise, which means it’s predicted that by the year 2080, we’ll have as many as 15 different generational bands living alongside one another.  Now, imagine that all 15 coexisting generations were as alienated by each other as a pre-teen might be from his grandfather today. It’s a recipe for social disaster! So how can we avoid it?  By embracing the Gen Z effect. This means using technology as a bridging force to strengthen the bonds between generations, allowing all of us to become part of Generation Z and unite to build a better future together.  In this way, we’ll need to learn not only how to become part of Gen Z as individuals, but as organizations. Let’s consider the six different forces that will shape how future businesses are built – forces that we need to take into account if we want to embrace the Gen Z effect. Six different forces will influence business in the future. The first is demographic change, with its radical impacts on society and the way we do business. So what does demographic change look like? In recent decades, mortality has largely decreased. More and more people are gaining access to clean water, food, education and medicine. At the same time, increased access to contraception means people are having fewer children. Ageing populations are emerging all over the world as a result.  This will have big consequences for business. Today, you might have two or maybe even three generations working alongside each other. But future workplaces may feature five to seven different generations, each with varying experiences, attitudes and technological knowledge.  Enter the Gen Z effect: a powerful solution for positive workplace dynamics. If you want your business to thrive in the future, then your employees must first stop seeing each other as different generations. But how? Over the last decade, remote work has been introduced in many companies with great success. In fact, The Future Laboratory, a consultant for future trends, went so far as to claim that offices will soon be obsolete, and that more flexible work patterns will be introduced and embraced by workers.  Not only does this reduce the chance of people making tiresome assumptions about their coworkers because of their age, it also has financial benefits. IBM started their remote program in 1995 and saw a 50 percent increase in productivity as well as $700 million in real estate savings. Now 39 percent of their workers work remotely. You’re probably using a tablet or smartphone to read these blinks right now. Only a few years ago, this would have been unbelievable. Today we embrace our new, ever-online world. Our state of hyperconnection is force number two. Some aspects of technology are really quite astonishing. Take our rapidly increasing interactions with devices, for example. Can you guess how many times you connect each day? It’s about 243 times on average, whether it’s your car’s GPS, your phone or your laptop.  Today there are around 70 billion devices connected to the internet. And, it’s estimated that the number of intelligent sensors, such as tracking devices in cars, will exceed three trillion in 2020. These incredible figures reflect that we are no longer content to own just one device. Younger people may own phones, laptops and tablets, and two of each!  It’s crucial that your employees are able to thrive in this hyperconnected world. This means that technology education should be one of your organization’s priorities. Many companies have already used mentoring schemes to help new employees learn from veterans that have decades of experience.  But in light of the Gen Z effect, let’s consider this pattern of learning in reverse. As older employees aren’t familiar with the technological tools they need to connect with customers and coworkers, they’ll benefit from learning tech skills from someone younger.  Reverse mentoring is in fact the very tactic that the authors employed in their company, Delphi Group. In 1994, they hired a young musician to work on their IT system. He didn’t have any qualifications other than knowing Macintosh well and loving cutting-edge technology. Over the next decade he was the person everybody went to with questions about technology. This became a simple and effective way to keep everyone up-to-date. There was a time when smartphones were cutting edge and reserved for a select few. But in an astoundingly short time they became affordable and accessible. Today, owning a smartphone is the norm, and excellent example of slingshotting technology. Slingshotting is force number three. Three things determine whether a tech product will slingshot, or become rapidly and widely available. First, it needs to be simple and easy to use. Secondly, it should increase the availability of the user, allowing them to be online more often. And finally, the technology must be able to collect data from the users in order to adapt to their needs.  The iPad was another recent slingshotting success. This tablet was targeted at those who wanted to increase their availability, while also enjoying a tool that could do more than a smartphone could.  With streamlined design featuring just one button to return to the home page, functions that allowed people to connect to their family and friends anytime, and a memory for the unique preferences and interests of the user, the iPad was able to slingshot and meet needs we didn’t even know we had.  Tools like smartphones and iPads aren’t just a pleasant addition to everyday life – they can also be great for business, and boost productivity in new ways. But simply buying iPads for all your employees or upgrading to cutting-edge software will do more harm than good if nobody knows how to use them!  Of course, no employee enjoys sitting through training sessions. So how can you make the most of new technology while keeping your workplace engaged? With a healthy dose of fun and games to help the slingshot process! Gamification is the process of using data to motivate people by adopting game mechanics to allow employees to interact with technology in a playful way. For instance, a sales company might use the data collected by their employees’ devices to track their sales progress and present it in a fun way that lets them compare their numbers with coworkers. It creates a bit of friendly rivalry that’s good for motivation.  Through TV, newspapers, radio, the internet or on the streets, we are bombarded with ads every day. In the last century, a memorable ad needed a big budget. But in our hyperconnective world, expensive production just won’t cut it. You need force four: the shift from affluence to influence, or loyalty. Say a company like Coca-Cola wants to launch a new line of products. Previously they might have taken a large chunk out of their ad funds to launch a campaign. But with the rise of the internet, consumers have countless opportunities to express their opinions. So the challenge of maintaining a good reputation is far greater today.  In this way, social media can be a public relations curse. But it can also be a blessing. Take Dove, whose Campaign for Beauty utilized social media to spread a powerful message questioning beauty standards. This message resonated with many, leading the Dove campaign to be liked and shared virally over several platforms.  Companies who understand social media in this way have hit the jackpot. They create an online presence that provides supporters with constant, always accessible interaction through special offers, competitions and access to exclusive information. One project that earned their advertising success through loyal online supporters is Free the Children. This not-for-profit organization aims to improve children’s education around the world. In just two decades, it gained 2.3 million members and built 650 schools and classrooms without spending a single cent on marketing. How did they do it? By being there for their supporters and earning a good reputation that spread and grew with each positive impression. Wouldn’t it be great to have a new skill or qualification? Many of us would love the opportunity to learn but worry that we won’t have the time, or that it’s far too late anyway. If that’s the case, then you’d better think again!  Force five: Education is no longer a matter of age or location. The traditional process of completing school, perhaps moving on to college or university, then ending our education when we choose a job, may soon be a thing of the past.  Technology has given a whole new face to education. With endless possibilities for connecting, its possible for 70-year-old college students to learn a new discipline after spending their entire life in the same job – and they don’t have to move to a city that offers their new course of study, either.  Generation Z has introduced two highly influential aspects of education. The first is MOOC, which stands for Massive Open Online Course. A MOOC enables everybody to attend classes, no matter their age or location. One MOOC was led by Stanford University, with over 160,000 registrants and 23,000 completions of the course.  These classes are largely enabled by slingshotting technology and hyperconnectivity. While higher education might still be seen as a largely upper or middle class privilege, this is rapidly changing. Courses taught by elite professors are accessible to anybody who can reach a device with an internet connection. Another significant aspect of Gen Z education is its gamification. While traditional education has focused on learning through lectures, MOOCs and other modern pedagogical initiatives are designed to engage their students and stop them losing attention or missing parts of the course. For instance, if you want to learn the guitar, you can get the game Rocksmith, which teaches you real guitar playing and only allows you to move further after you complete tasks to test your learning. The sixth and final force that defines Gen Z is lifehacking. For those who haven’t heard the new buzzword already, lifehacking refers to innovative and creative problem solving that saves time and money by departing from accepted methods.  Lifehacking means using the opportunities that hyperconnectivity presents to deal with different problems. Take fundraising. A few years back, the City of Honolulu needed a new website. The first estimate they were given by web designers amounted to $9,300,300 of tax payer’s money.  When the citizens heard about this, they were outraged and decided to lifehack the problem by finding a creative solution. They set up an online competition inviting contestants to design the best website at the lowest price, and shortly after, a new website was built for only $9,300. To lifehack the future for creative solutions, Gen Z will use three important developments. The first of these is crowdfunding for start-ups and projects. This entails raising funding contributions from a large number of people via the internet. Another key player in lifehacking is 3D printing, a technology that enables people to produce things for themselves, independently of manufacturers.  Finally, the rethinking of intellectual property and patents will push the limits of lifehacking. Consider Open Source innovations as an example of lifehacking. These are free apps that can be downloaded by anyone, and change the way that traditional intellectual property is handled. Before, patents were usually owned by wealthy organizations and needed to be paid for, but Open Source allows everyone to use and contribute to the newest developments. This kind of lifehacking allows simple solutions to be found without adhering to the old system of paying for patents. The key message in this book: By embracing new technology and being open to change, everybody will be able to become part of Generation Z. If we unite under the six forces that drive the Gen Z Effect, we’ll be able to create a better future for ourselves.  Actionable advice: Ask for help!  Next time you feel lost and out-of-touch with the new technology you’re required to learn, instead of panicking and giving up, try to ask a younger person at your workplace if they have any know-how. This will probably both flatter your colleague and provide a simple entrance into the foreign land of new technology.  Suggested further reading: Millennial Money by Patrick O’Shaughnessy Although technological advances have made it easier than ever to invest in the stock market, today’s Millennials (young adults born between 1980 and 2000) tend to be risk-averse. But this kind of thinking is misguided. Given that benefits like Social Security and retirement pensions are imperiled, it has never been more important for young people to start investing in their future financial security. Got feedback?

It is a group of people who live with no specific connection or attachment to nationality, who have formed their own mode of self-sustained living. Now, you might think of the Apache or the Cherokee, envisioning a shaman beating a drum beside a bonfire. But there are other, less obvious tribes out there. For example, in recent decades a new tribe has come into existence. It’s called the Global Tribe and it has a major influence on our everyday life, creating a shared, global code. You didn’t know? Well, that’s what these blinks are all about. In these blinks, you’ll also discover how Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg are related to the Global Tribe; if you are an unwitting member of the Global Tribe; and why, according to the tribe, “hand-made” is better than “Made in China.” In recent years, new technologies and changes to the way we travel have led to an unprecedented level of international interconnectedness. Smartphones provide information to people around the world at the tap of a finger, and inexpensive airlines shuttle people to far-flung destinations. With this new interconnectedness, a new phenomenon has emerged called the global unconscious, or the Global Code. Of course, every culture still has its own unique elements; people across the globe maintain their own way of speaking, working and cooking. Yet there are also cross-cultural experiences that we share: people go to school, find a job, get married, raise a family. And no matter where you are, most people share a similar dream of finding a better place to live, a place that will offer a better career, a nicer house and an ideal environment for their children. These shared dreams and beliefs form a Global Code that has emerged from today’s interconnected world. Media and travel have given rise to a multicultural Global Tribe that follows and finds inspiration in the goals and aspirations of others. The Global Tribe is a small group of highly connected and highly mobile influencers who aren’t bound to one specific society or culture. Instead, the Global Tribe adheres to a truly Global Code that takes its ideas and inspirations from worldwide sources. Since this tribe is made up of influential individuals, the pieces of culture that are absorbed into their code become highly popular throughout the world; the tribe is an international trendsetter. For example, if the tribe decides that a certain brand of clothing or social network is superior, people across the world will follow suit and rush to buy or use that product – and, in no time, these choices will become the hottest items on the market. The power of the tribe has not gone unnoticed. Indeed, companies now create and market their products and services with the Global Code in mind. Most organizations have some sort of hierarchy, and the Global Tribe is no exception. It has a distinct hierarchy that’s not unlike the kind you might find in a kingdom or royal empire. This hierarchy is made up of six layers. The first three are: the court, the courtesans and the suppliers. As with any royal structure, we find the court at the very top. Those in the tribe that belong to the court are the ones who symbolize success, money and fame. While everyone knows who these people are, only a select few actually know them personally. The members of the court are the real tastemakers: they decide what music and fashion is “in” and they define the “cool” ways to act and behave. Well-known members of the court include Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, the Lauder family and the Koch brothers. On the second tier of the hierarchy are the courtesans. They aspire to be members of the court and, like Kate Middleton, they might marry a prince to get in. Others strive to reach this status by following in court members’ footsteps – by attending the same universities, say, or going to charity events. Unlike the members of the court, courtesans are eager for attention and good press; they, like all up-and-comers, crave the spotlight. The third tier is where we find the suppliers. These are the ones who provide luxurious items to the court, whether they’re watches or cars. They throw parties for the court and try their best to please them and predict what they’ll want to buy next. Famous suppliers for the Global Tribe are high-end brands like Cartier, Rolex, Chanel, Rolls-Royce and Bentley. At the top of this category are the realtors who are eager to help court members buy and sell properties. They also like to predict the court’s needs by showing them ads for homes in Newport Beach while they’re vacationing in Aspen. As we continue to work our way down the hierarchy of the Global Tribe, we hit the fourth tier, which is made up of the symbolic creators. These are artists, thinkers and philosophers – the ones who create symbolic and artistic value for the Global Tribe. Just as Louis XIV and the court at Versaille had creative people to help provide style and elegance, the court of the Global Tribe also benefits from the help of symbolic creators. Oscar Niemeyer, a Brazilian architect, is a good example of a more recent symbolic creator. He influenced modern architecture by working for the country’s elite and designing their capital. Coco Chanel is another. She changed the face of fashion and was a go-to designer for the rich and famous. After the artists, we have the fifth tier, which contains the third culture individuals. This category refers to the children of the Global Tribe, people who were born to parents that originated from one culture but had children after moving to another. Third culture individuals tend to spend a lot of time moving around and living in many different cultures. Since these people might come from a military family or from parents who had to move around for business reasons, they may have less money than the others in the tribe. Third culture individuals also tend to be more tolerant and open-minded than people from a monoculture family. Finally, we have the aspirants, or the social climbers.   Aspirants live outside the tribe but are desperate to become members. While they have the money to try to become a member, they hold back out of fear that they don’t have permission or understand the rules of the Global Tribe. Aspirants still have things to learn – like how to speak about topics such as art, opera and polo matches or how to mingle properly at a charity event. After the first few blinks, you might be thinking about how you can become a member of the Global Tribe. Well, one of the first things you have to do is adhere to the rule of three. The rule of three means that every member of the tribe must have at least three places, be it a city or a hub, that they call home. And if they don’t own property in these places, then the rule says that the member must have lived in three different countries, speak three different languages and be familiar with three different cultures. For example, let’s look at Jean-Paul, a prime Global Tribe member. His mother is French and his father is American, which gives him two nationalities. As a result, he’s lived in both France and the United States, but he also lived in Toronto, Canada, during his university years, and worked in Madrid for four years. Given his background and his job in Madrid, Jean-Paul speaks English, French, and Spanish, but he’s also familiar with Italian thanks to his Italian girlfriend. All of this has given him a great network of friends, classmates and colleagues from all around the world and makes Jean-Paul a certified member of the Global Tribe. And people like Jean-Paul, who have a large global network, tend to stay with friends when they travel, instead of in hotels. This is generally true of Global Tribe members. With mobile phones, email and platforms like Facebook and Twitter, it’s easy for them to stay connected and maintain their international contacts. It also helps that members of the Global Tribe often live in conveniently located and internationally connected places. These places are large cities or hubs that offer big airports which provide direct flights to other well-connected hubs in the world. They’re also business-friendly cities, the kind that support free trade and are strategically placed to connect people with goods and services. Big cities that meet these qualifications are Hong Kong, Singapore, Dubai, Monaco and Luxembourg. As we saw in the previous blinks, it’s the top members of the tribe within the court that set the trends. But it’s not just other members who follow their lead; everyone follows the standards of luxury that the court sets. Since the world is so interconnected these days, everybody can carefully follow the Global Tribe to find out what they’re buying – and make it their goal to do the same. For years it was fashion magazines that offered a peek into their world, but now you can go online any day and check a few Instagram accounts to see what famous members of the court are wearing and buying. Since their cross-cultural tastes are seen as being the best, and since they have sufficient funds to spare no expense, the court is now perfectly positioned to set the world’s standard for luxury. And for the Global Tribe, luxury doesn’t just mean expensive – it also refers to something that is unique and handmade. So, rather than just looking for a clothing label that says “Made in Italy” or “Made in France,” the Global Code will define luxury with labels like “bespoke,” “sur-mesure” or “tailor-made.” In the tribe, items that are unique and handmade are valued above all others. In recent times there has been a backlash against disposable products or things that are machine-made through mass production. People want one-of-a-kind products that provide the uniqueness and artistry that comes with being handmade. These are products that are created with patience, passion and commitment, which adds a whole extra layer of luxury to the item. For example, there are plenty of fine machine-made watches, but a handmade watch from Patek Philippe is a highly coveted item, due to the skill and craftsmanship that goes into making it. In the end, it’s the Global Code for luxury that sets the highest standards and creates a new system of reference that the rest of society follows. So, if being a member of the Global Tribe isn’t within your reach, maybe you want to create a global brand that will appeal to them and meet the conditions of the Global Code. One of the first steps to creating a successful global brand is to market your product in a way that resonates with people around the world. After all, if you start out with a brand that people can relate to, it could eventually develop into a luxury product. Take Jeep, for example. They used a marketing campaign that told people they didn’t need roads because, with a Jeep, they could create their own. Men could relate to this message because, subconsciously, every guy wants to be his own boss and create his own rules. The success of Jeep’s campaign shows us that if you know what the Global Tribe desires, you can use that knowledge to create a luxurious and enduring product or brand. Other brands have found success by leveraging the knowledge that the Global Tribe enjoys being a special and exclusive group that can travel easily, and they’ve used this knowledge to their advantage. Laphroaig is a successful brand of Scotch whiskey that adapted its marketing plan to make its customers feel special. They did this by offering their customers a membership to the club, Friends of Laphroaig. And once they joined the club, the offer got even more special: members were then given the opportunity to buy a one-square-foot piece of land in Scotland. And when it came to traveling, American Express knew that the Global Tribe likes to get around simply and quickly. So they launched a new and easy one-step international arrival system for their customers. This allowed flyers to arrive at an airport and immediately get assigned a personal guide to lead them through the terminal and assist with procedures. With this, American Express hit two key elements of the Global Code: they made customers feel special and they made traveling easier. And that is a win-win. The key message in this book: The Global Code is a new set of values and beliefs that are shaped and structured by the Global Tribe. People look up to the Global Tribe due to their position as cross-cultural tastemakers and can follow them closely thanks to the growing interconnectedness of the world. These international icons of style set today’s standards of luxury, thereby dictating which products people around the world want to buy.  Actionable advice: Speak culture when you do business abroad.  When you travel abroad, even if you don’t speak the country’s language, try to speak its culture! This is particularly important if you’re conducting business while traveling abroad. Before meeting with your business partner, prepare yourself by learning about the country’s customs, such as how to address superiors, how deals are made and how to dress appropriately. Got feedback?

It seems that the ordinary worker is being exploited by those at the top as leaders take an ever bigger slice of the corporate pie, leaving their employees with barely enough to survive. So how can good, decent leaders change this hostile public narrative and recover the reputations of leaders everywhere? The answer has to do with heroism. Heroic leadership is a powerful antidote to the sort of greed, selfishness and short-termism that has become rife among our most powerful executives. Discover how any leader can go from zero to hero and radically change the perception of their employees and the wider community. By examining real-life success stories and inspirational lessons from the author’s own career, we’ll learn how leaders can transform their relationships with their staff, and learn why, when it comes to people and profits, leaders don’t need to choose between one or the other. Read on to discover: Why great leaders never go it alone; What you can learn from Captain “Sully” Sullenberger’s incredible flight landing; and What happened when Starbucks failed to live up to its own heroic ideals. In the era of #metoo, when so many of our corporate leaders are being caught up in odious scandals, it can be easy to adopt a cynical approach toward them all. Are they really interested in the well-being of the ordinary people who work for them, or are they just out for themselves, exploiting those lower down the food chain along the way? In this climate of extreme distrust, we need executives who can refute these terrible examples of toxic leadership and prove that the good guys are still winning. In other words, we are in desperate need of heroic leaders. The author’s journey toward heroic leadership started in 2009, when he was invited to attend the annual conference of Hero Partners, a nationwide club for leaders in charge of fast-growing businesses who are also committed to responsible, sustainable and compassionate entrepreneurialism. The author, himself a Chief Marketing Officer at the time, was so impressed with Hero Partners and its values that if he went all in and bought the company in 2016. So what are the heroic values that the author and his club of forward-thinking entrepreneurs believe all leaders should live by? Well, commitment and courage are essential. Specifically, leaders need the commitment and courage to constantly find ways to give something back and to serve others, including their employees, their communities, or the environment. Simple, right? Perhaps, but most businesses these days are doing a poor job in this regard. Instead, they’re wholly focused on three totally different things: their clients, their shareholders and their bottom line. And the hard-working employees? They’re overlooked, not listened to, and have to make do with scraps from the boardroom table. So what’s the solution? As we’ll find out, leaders can go from zero to hero by recalibrating their focus, ensuring that their workers, and even the wider community, start to feel that the company’s goals are aligned with their own. These employee goals are likely to include having a decent life for themselves while doing the best they can at work. Ask yourself, are you, as a leader, committed to this goal, too? If not, it’s time to re-read your company’s mission statement, where these goals are likely enshrined, and get to work on embodying them. What do you, as a leader, value more: profit or people? This deceptively simple question is usually the author’s first question to business leaders he meets. And in fact, the most heroic answer is neither one nor the other. The hero’s answer is both. Both people and profits are of equal importance to a company, and there is no need to compromise the health of one to maximize the well-being of the other. Now that we’ve cleared up this common misunderstanding, let’s take a closer look at what sort of values you’ll need to implement in order to make significant profits while improving relations with employees. Firstly, boosting your profits means adopting the values of operational excellence. Implementing operational excellence as a leader involves increasing your business revenues over time, ensuring your products are superior to the competition’s, creating as much value as you can for your clients and customers, and consistently recruiting and retaining talented employees. If you can get all of these things right and stick like glue to these business principles, profits are sure to follow. Now let’s take a look at the other side of the coin. What are the values you need to implement to ensure you’re also looking after the people who are involved with your business? These can be people directly involved, such as your employees, or indirectly, as in the wider community. In other words, how can you start being a hero to those around you? The first step is to understand that the best leaders don’t try to go it alone. Instead, they’re open to collaborating with everyone around them who has something valuable to contribute, no matter who they are or where they come from. For instance, heroic leaders will take the time to truly listen to the people around them and won’t hesitate to admit when they’re wrong, or when someone they manage knows more than they do. Heroic leaders seek out many different perspectives on the challenges their company faces, and they try to bring diversity to the decision-making process. In practice, this means including people of different genders, ethnicities and even generations. For instance, if you’re a baby boomer leader, seek out the opinions of millennials, and if you’re a millennial start-up whiz kid, don’t be afraid to seek the advice of someone a little older than you. It’s important for leaders to have values, but it’s even more important that they live them too. After all, what good is it telling others, and yourself, that you value something, if you’re not actually putting that value into practice in your everyday work life? The author witnessed this disconnect between espousing values and living them in his own company. When one of his digital media employees said in a meeting that she had achieved a 60 percent open rate on a batch of email newsletters she’d sent to the company’s clients, the author was shocked. After all, these clients were paying to receive these emails and thus should have been considering them interesting enough to open and read. The author eventually realized that the biggest issue was that the employee wasn’t concerned by this mediocre outcome. Why? Because they weren’t living the company’s values. Specifically, the company’s core mission to relentlessly deliver results. Here was an employee whose job was to tell their clients about what great values the company had, but they were forgetting to implement these same values in their own work. This got the author thinking, have we all become so wrapped up in telling people our own story and values that we’ve forgotten to live by them? Incredibly, this simple disconnect has threatened to destroy some of the world’s best-loved brands in recent years. Just consider what happened to Starbucks. In May 2018, Starbucks closed 8,000 stores for an afternoon to give all of their staff a training session on racial bias. Why? Because just one month earlier, two African American men were arrested in a Starbucks in Philadelphia, after the manager called the police to report that the men were refusing to leave the premises, even though they were just waiting for a third friend to arrive before making a purchase.   Not only were the manager’s actions racist, but they also went against the company’s explicit values: that Starbucks is a communal space where both paying and non-paying customers can sit, relax and pass the time. While the company had spent years selling this warm and welcoming story about their brand, they had failed to test whether their employees were actually living it. At least one manager wasn’t, and to this day, the phrase ‘getting Starbucked’ is often used as an ironic label to describe the victimization of African Americans. So when you’re telling outsiders about your company’s lofty values, be sure that you’re living up to them too. As a heroic leader, it’s important to build a heroic culture in your workplace – but exactly what does this sort of culture look like in practice? You might assume that an excellent working culture looks like lots of enthusiastic employees, all working long, productive hours while having a great time in each other’s company. However, signs of a heroic culture might be a lot more subtle than that. Consider the following example of great corporate culture that the author witnessed recently, but which a less attuned observer might have missed. The author was invited to tour the campus of High Point University, a college in North Carolina. Up until 2005, this college was struggling to attract students, secure funding and find resources. However, this all changed when new President Nido Qubein took over. Within a few short years, he nearly quadrupled the student body, from 1450 students to over 4000, increased annual funding from $38 million to nearly $290 million and took the number of buildings owned by the university from 22 to 112. But this impressive turnaround wasn’t the example of heroic culture that the author remembers from his visit. It was when one of the Vice Presidents stooped to pick up a candy bar wrapper that someone had left lying around. When he saw this senior executive wordlessly stuff the wrapper in his pocket, the author not only knew, but felt the heroic culture of excellence all around him. It was not part of the Vice President’s job description to pick up litter, nor was there any expectation that he should do so. But still, he did it. Why? Because he truly cared about the campus and keeping it pristine, as well as giving his guests the best possible impression of the place. The lesson to take away from this small deed is that a workplace culture doesn’t need to be loud or showy to be heroic. In fact, it’s the everyday examples of individual employees taking personal responsibility and accountability that all add up to make a heroic working environment. These tiny positive behaviors set the mood of a working environment, and, when carried out by those in leadership positions, they inspire everyone else to strive for excellence in every little thing that they do. January 15th, 2009. Flight 1549 had only been in the air for two minutes when flames started shooting out from one of its engines. What happened next shocked and amazed the world. Captain Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger landed the burning plane in the Hudson river in New York. After the crash landing, one of the passengers Dave Sanderson quickly found himself waist-deep in cold water. After a terrifying few minutes, he managed to get out of the plane and swim to a boat. He was taken to the hospital, treated for hypothermia and kept in overnight. Amazingly, the very next day, Sanderson went into his workplace straight from the hospital to let his colleagues know he was fine. His boss’s first words to him when he arrived? “Are you going to Michigan next week?” Sanderson was shocked. How could his boss be so unconcerned about what he’d just been through? Unfortunately, the answer is simple. His boss was part of an unheroic and wholly uncaring workplace culture. As this shocking incident demonstrates, Sanderson’s boss, and the company at large, didn’t see him as a person with whom they had an important relationship. Instead, they simply saw him as a tool through which they achieved financial success. This was why they instantly asked about Michigan because they knew Sanderson was on the brink of making a deal there. Two words – relationships and transactions – make all the difference between a heroic working culture and a toxic one. Heroic cultures are focused on the relationships they have with their employees and clients, and unheroic ones are solely concerned with transactions. Just consider how differently US Airways, the flight operator, treated Sanderson. They went out of their way to care for him and the other passengers during the aftermath of the crash, even assigning him to a personal liaison assistant to help him get back on track. The result? Sanderson is a fan of the airline for life and a loyal customer despite his ordeal. But his employer, the one that didn’t give a damn? Sanderson, a top-performing employee, no longer works for them, and he has nothing good to say about them. This just goes to show that a heroic working culture can bring you lasting loyalty, but an unheroic one can lead to an exodus of valuable employees. Heroic leaders exist in all walks of life, but the impact some of them can have is remarkable. When Rob Ryan founded Ascend Communications in 1989, he couldn’t have predicted that in just ten short years, he would sell his company to the tune of $20 billion. But when he did, Ryan’s life went on just as before. He ate lunch in the same place, and he drove the same car. In fact, the only big difference was to the lives of the people around him. How? He made them all millionaires. When he sold his company, Ryan ensured that everyone who had helped him achieve his staggering success was duly rewarded. Instead of keeping that $20 billion to himself, he set aside 10 percent of the money for his employees. And he didn’t only reward the executives who worked for him; he made millionaires of secretaries and janitors as well. The author often tells the story of Ryan’s generosity when he’s persuading others of the values of heroic leadership. Another example that he shares with his listeners is that of Hamdi Ulukaya, an entrepreneur who founded the successful yogurt company Chobani in 2005. Like Ryan, Ulukaya understood the value of giving back to his employees. When he founded his business, he told his workers straight off the bat that his plan was to share up to 10 percent of the firm’s sale price with them if it was ever sold or became a public company. Nowadays, Chobani is worth $1.5 billion and 2000 of the employees who work there are poised to become millionaires if the company is ever sold. Ulukaya never framed his generosity as a gift. Instead, he told his employees that he was making a pact with them and that they would all stick together, with everyone taking the responsibility to create a business with real value and longevity. In other words, Ulukaya, like Ryan, wanted to empower the people around him. This is the true value of heroic leadership: it’s not about handouts or being nice for the sake of being nice. Instead, being a heroic leader means gathering those around you and giving enough back to them so that they too can reach their full potential and get their share of the fruits of their labor. The key message in these blinks: Heroic leaders aren’t solely focused on profits and transactions. Instead, they also understand that it’s people who make these things possible, and they are what truly makes an organization thrive. By sharing their good fortunes, being open to the perspectives of others and living their organizational values instead of just preaching them, leaders can start giving back to their workers and build strong relationships that help everyone excel.  Actionable advice: Heroic generosity is all relative. Unsurprisingly, the stories about generous billionaire entrepreneurs get the most media attention. But even if you and your company are miles outside the Fortune 500, you can still participate in heroic generosity. Remember, it’s all relative. If you’re a business owner with multi-million dollar profits and you give your ten employees a $50 bonus every year, you’re probably not winning any prizes for heroism. But if you’re a struggling entrepreneur, without the funds for financial rewards, your team will likely appreciate the occasional free coffee or a one-to-one session with you where you take the time to appreciate their achievements. Why? Because you’re giving as much as you can and being generous with your time. In other words, you’re being heroic. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

Robinson and Dean M. Schroeder","summary":"What should be the driving force behind any enterprise? If you said “profits,” you’re not alone. Yet how do you achieve a stellar balance sheet? Should you be a ruthless corporate shark, or perhaps an organizational mastermind? None of the above! The real key to success is the ability to come up with great ideas. The organizations that know how to do this are the ones that crush the competition every time. While this might seem obvious, coming up with great ideas is easier said than done. These blinks will show you how you can unlock the creativity in your company and innovate not only constantly but superbly. And importantly, you’ll learn how your great ideas will keep your competitors at bay and profits rolling in. In the following blinks, you’ll discover why clothing producer Zara is more nimble than Italian fashion houses; why drilling holes into the floor of a bar increased profits and employee satisfaction; and why a 26-minute break for Swedish truck builders makes them more productive. Business managers and executives often fall into the too-easy trap of thinking that, from their perch at the top, they have a clear picture of what their organization needs to succeed. But of course, this assumption is wrong! Front-line employees are the people who deal with customer frustrations, problems and wishes  face-to-face and on a daily basis. Managers in contrast rely on focus groups and market research. While such research is often sophisticated, there’s no substitute for daily customer interaction. Building strategy around real-life insights into customer satisfaction can make a huge difference. That’s exactly what Clarion-Stockholm, a four-star hotel, discovered when it enlisted its employees in developing new ideas based on what they saw as pressing customer needs. Sure, adding organic cocktails to a drinks menu might not seem like a major brainstorm, but when you implement small things aimed to make customers happy, these positive changes can have a snowball effect. Think about it: happy customers not only spend more money, but also are far more likely to tell their friends about a great experience. What’s more, happier customers in turn mean employees are more productive! Hotel bar staff at the Clarion-Stockholm were responsible for emptying bottle bins every hour during busy periods. This task not only took them away from customers, but also was tedious and dirty. To improve the situation, the team came up with an ingenious solution. They drilled holes in the bar floor, and installed tubes that led directly into recycling bins in the basement. Bar staff could then toss bottles down the tubes without missing a beat at the bar! As a result, employees were happy, more time was dedicated to customers, and overall sales grew. As we’ve learned, implementing employee-generated ideas is your best chance of satisfying customers. But why do so many companies fail in this respect? The answer lies with traditional managerial attitudes. Unfortunately, when managers rise to the top, they often lose respect for those below them. This observation was confirmed through research; scientists at Stanford University found that many managers believe they are somehow superior to employees lower down on the food chain. This kind of attitude is the natural byproduct of a traditional organizational hierarchy. Unlike other employees, managers typically wear suits, work in private offices and receive higher pay. Everything about this promotes the idea that managers are somehow “better” than their subordinates. Yet this attitude is ultimately detrimental to an idea-driven organization. So what can your company do to implement a different kind of managerial culture, encouraging ideas from the bottom-up? When you hire or promote a manager, look for a person who possesses two crucial personal attributes: You want a humble manager, or someone who won’t hold their subordinates at arm’s length or feels she is somehow better than her employees. And you also want a good listener, someone who will always consider employee opinions and seek out great ideas. And once you’ve hired the right manager, make sure she understands and is engaged in all that happens on the front lines! One of Toyota’s core managerial concepts is “going to the gemba.” Gemba is a Japanese word that refers to the actual place where the real work is done. All of Toyota’s managers and employees operate under the assumption that everything that really matters to the company happens at the gemba, so they focus their attention on making what happens at the gemba run more efficiently! Although it’s crucial to hire managers who deeply engage with front-line staff, you won’t get anywhere if you don’t have a streamlined organization. A simple, three-pronged approach will help you transform your company into an efficient machine. First, eliminate needless bureaucracy. If the process for fixing a simple computer problem involves sending a memo to the IT manager first, then running the request by accounting, your company is too bureaucratic. Cut the red tape and give staff the power to make their own decisions whenever possible. If management needs to get involved, ensure too that the process is transparent and predictable. That way decisions can be made quickly and implemented as soon as possible. Second, establish clear, understandable goals. Too often, managers use incomprehensible jargon when speaking with front-line staff, which is confusing, and worse, can be discouraging. For example, you’ll no doubt baffle an employee working in your hotel’s laundry facility if you asked him to propose methods for streamlining and making efficiencies. However, if you instead talked about ways to save energy or water, you might actually get results. And finally, make it easy for different departments to work together. Clothing retailer Zara has built a nimble organization, consisting of a bunch of three-person teams. Each team (a designer, a commercial manager and a country supervisor) can design, prototype, manufacture and deliver new items to thousands of stores worldwide in just 15 days. Compared to the rest of the fashion industry, in which new garments are usually put together over a year or longer, Zara’s process is fast and streamlined. It’s not a serious shock that the main advantage of having an idea-driven organization is the generation of lots of great ideas! And obviously that’s great, as ideas are an investment in the future of your company. But to make sure you’re actually producing ideas, you need to promote innovation within your company. Be patient: employees need time and resources to develop great ideas and implement them. One way to kick start the process is to incorporate “brainstorming time” into the overall work schedule. For example, at the company’s main engine factory in Stockholm, Swedish truck maker Scania shuts down the assembly line for 26 minutes, once a week, to allow departments to hold idea meetings. Furthermore, each team is deliberately overstaffed by two people, to give employees enough time to implement their ideas. As it happens, this resource commitment is a major reason the company has consistently managed to improve overall productivity by a whopping 12 to 15 percent each year. You should also make sure to reward innovation. After all, if you want ideas to be a normal part of the job for your staff, you should treat it like any other aspect of an employee’s job performance. This means you should focus on rewarding ideas during performance reviews and when considering bonuses, merit increases and promotions! So now you have a good sense of how an idea-driven organization operates. Keep reading to find out exactly what it takes to develop, launch and manage the idea process itself. Transforming your company into an idea-driven organization may seem daunting. Luckily there are three easy paths you can follow to get going. One option is to use the Kaizen teian system. In Japanese, kaizen means “improvement” while teain means “suggestion.” This phrase describes a philosophy about how small changes, routinely applied and sustained over a long period of time, lead to significant benefits for a business. Within this framework, all employees, from CEOs to assembly-line workers, play a role in facilitating change. The process is straightforward. An employee speaks out about a problem; the team determines the root causes of the problem; the team considers solutions; the team tests solutions; and the best solutions are implemented and standardized. Then the kaizen teain cycle starts all over again! Another option is the idea meeting process. Employees are prompted to bring “opportunities for improvement” to team meetings, where suggestions can be discussed and then implemented. Say you’re a bartender who thinks your club is understaffed. At the weekly team meeting, you can mention this issue and suggest a solution, such as scheduling more staff. Everyone can discuss and then decide how to resolve the issue. A final option is to use the idea board process. This approach combines idea meetings with a large idea board, allowing staff to collect and process ideas visually. Idea boards are highly effective because their visibility keeps ideas front and center for everyone on a daily basis. Additionally, idea boards create social pressure to complete assigned tasks on time. If an employee is really keen on an idea on the board, he’ll be eager to keep up on its progress. What’s more, if the employee fails to deliver, everyone will know! As soon as you launch your idea system, you’ll see how great ideas start to flood in. Front-line employees know where the problems are, and will jump at the chance to share their thoughts! However, once the obvious problems have been solved, the flood of new ideas may slow to a trickle. At this point, you’ll have to get better at “problem finding,” that is, discovering less obvious ideas. To do this, you can follow two methods: idea activators and idea mining. Idea activators are short training sessions or educational modules that teach people techniques to trigger new ideas on a specific topic. At Subaru Indiana Automotive (SIA), for instance, employees learned the difference between recycling and downcycling. Downcycling occurs when the recycling process reduces the value or quality of the material. True recycling maintains original physical characteristics and level of quality. Armed with this new knowledge, employees generated hundreds of ideas to avoid downcycling. For example, someone suggested getting suppliers to use standardized uncolored plastic for packaging, so different parts could be recycled together without degrading the value of the polymer. Idea mining is the second method for improving your organization’s problem-finding skills. This process relies on the principle that most great ideas contain even more hidden, implicit ideas. Let’s say your hotel invents a new cocktail, and someone suggests that the bar staff should taste test it. A good idea, but one that can be pushed further: Why not get the restaurant staff to taste the cocktail? How about customers, too? In this way, encouraging your employees to dig deeper will reveal new opportunities for continuous improvement. The key message in this book: Promote innovation and creativity at every level of your organization to improve customer satisfaction, boost employee productivity and position your company for phenomenal long-term success.

Well, while the two roles might take place in very different settings and involve very different personalities, they do share common characteristics, which bring along similar challenges as well.  Itay Talgam has explored the world of orchestral music, its great (and not so great) conductors and, more importantly, what made them so brilliant. In The Ignorant Maestro, Talgram puts his findings into the context of business and introduces fresh perspectives on leadership and innovation.  In these blinks, you’ll discover how the structure of an orchestra resembles that of a company; why there is such a thing as brilliant ignorance; and why Herbert von Karajan and Leonard Bernstein were such great conductors. A symphony orchestra is made up of a hundred players – that’s one hundred people with the potential to make a lot of horrible noise. Of course, by working together, the orchestra’s members are able to create harmony, subtle nuances and, above all, sounds that evoke powerful emotional responses.  Now consider a large company. One hundred employees could make a terrible mess of any business, but if they work well together, they can generate profit, set up a great workflow and create a harmonious working environment. In business, as in an orchestra, individuals have to work as a team to make something special.  Imagine that you’re in the violin section of an orchestra and are eager to impress the conductor, your boss. You decide to play for all you are worth, but the conductor isn’t the least bit impressed. Why? Well, a violin section full of show-offs doesn’t make for a beautiful performance.  A beautiful performance occurs when all members of the violin section are able to play in tight unison, complementing each other. Likewise, a team of employees will be able to produce greater things than each team member would by themselves if they find a way to work together. But the similarities don’t end with just the teamwork; in businesses and in orchestras, there’s always someone at the top. Just like a department has its head and a business has its Chief Executive Officer, the orchestra has a leader – the conductor. The conductor guides the tempo with his baton, gives cues to different instruments and shows the orchestra how loudly to play or which emotion to convey. In this sense, the conductor is a great analogy for a business leader. The conductor doesn’t create anything as such, but leads the orchestra in its creation. He or she doesn’t play an instrument, but leads all the musicians who do, in order for them to maintain the same direction and goal. When you describe someone as ignorant, what are you really trying to say? In all likelihood, it’s not meant as a compliment. But is ignorance always a negative trait?  Being ignorant doesn’t mean you’re unintelligent. In fact, just because you lack knowledge in one area doesn’t mean you’re unable to understand concepts from an entirely different field. Sometimes, there’s a certain kind of ignorance that is desirable.  A farmer and a scientist are very knowledgeable in their respective fields, but might know nothing of the other. The fact that we can grasp one subject so thoroughly shows that we are perfectly capable of learning new things as well. In fact, ignorance can be seen as a way to avoid getting stuck in what we think we know. Even when we have extensive knowledge of something, we still need to move beyond that knowledge in order to come up with new ideas and innovations.  Think about great teachers. They don’t just push their perspective down a student's throat; instead, a great teacher guides the student through his ignorance, letting the student find the answers by himself. Embracing this brilliant ignorance makes us aware of all the things we don’t know and the possibilities that exist for us.  Take Beethoven, widely considered one of the great innovators of classical music. Of course, he was trained in the music of his time, but he wanted to push himself beyond that knowledge. He was often ridiculed and considered mad for experimenting with music, but without daring to put accepted musical conventions aside, he would never have become the brilliant composer that we know him as today.  Have you ever been on the London underground and heard the famous intercom tell you to “mind the gap”? Well, what if gaps aren’t to be minded and avoided, but instead explored? The gaps that present themselves in various aspects of life are in fact immaterial spaces, open to interpretation and new ideas. Music offers a good example of how gaps can be approached in a different way. Without pauses, music would just be notes upon notes, clinging together in a shapeless stream of sound. In many compositions, gaps emerge in the form of vague or incomplete information about the composer’s true intentions for the piece. Rather than fearing gaps, musicians revel in them, taking the opportunity to open the piece up to interpretation, and experiencing the thrill of new expressive possibilities.  New products can also create exciting gap experiences that lead to innovation. Remember when the iPad was launched? It was widely seen as little more than an oversized iPhone, and the product was ridiculed.  But soon enough, developers and savvy consumers began to use iPads in innovative ways, whether at home in the kitchen, in the classroom or during their travels. Today, we know that gaps in the iPad’s usages spawned a whole new electronics sector: the tablet market. Gaps can also put us on the path to unity. You might experience a gap when faced with a communication problem between team members that seems impossible to resolve.  By framing miscommunication in a different way, perhaps by likening your team to a family, a combat unit or a shipwrecked crew, each team member can better understand the conflict at hand and can begin to see the gap in a new light. This, in turn, will help team members see the situation from their coworkers’ perspectives, ultimately leading to a more unified work process.  If you feel like your team is avoiding the gaps, it’s time to start a dialogue around them. But how? There’s a crucial tool you’ll need – find out more in the next blink! In our jobs, we’ve all heard of tricks and techniques that will get people to listen to us. Keynote speakers often resort to the classic trick of opening their speech with a well-rehearsed joke. But for all the strategies invented to persuade people to pay attention, what tactics can we use to be good listeners ourselves?  It often seems that we have lost our ability to listen these days. When attending a keynote speech, we’re much more interested in speakers whose opinions match our own, and less interested in understanding different perspectives.  It can be hard to break out of this selective approach to listening – but it’s worth it. In fact, putting a bit of extra effort into listening goes a long way when trying to solve a problem.  The author illustrates this with an example from his father’s experience as a senior judge at the Tel Aviv courthouse. He presided as judge over the prosecution of one of Israel’s most famous crime families, the Alpersons. The family had been tried before, but the trial hadn’t actually gotten anywhere because of the disruptions the family would cause in the courtroom.  So, the author’s father decided to take a different approach: instead of silencing the family, he chose to listen to them. This made them feel respected, and far more willing to cooperate. Ultimately, the outcome of the trial proved less important than the family’s ability to take an active role in the process.  Being a part of the process and being heard are both critical when aiming to explore gaps in any field. Of course, many leaders consider it easier to take the reins and skip time-consuming dialogue. But whether you’re a conductor or a CEO, this is the wrong way to go. Find out why in the following blink.  What happens when leaders don’t work with their team, turning a deaf ear to any novel interpretations? Well, many conductors exhibit a leading style characterized by just this kind of command and control, and one such conductor is Riccardo Muti.  As the leader of the renowned La Scala opera in Milan, Muti was notorious for his stern manner and his unwillingness to leave anything to chance. Basically, there was one way to play: his way. But by not leaving open any gaps for interpretation, he failed to create a unified relationship with the orchestra. The working relationship deteriorated until the orchestra declared they had no confidence in Muti, who subsequently lost his position.   When keeping tight control over every aspect and rejecting the idea that there is always more to learn, there is a major risk that leaders will fail to create a sense of unity between them and the team they are leading.  But a leader doesn’t have to be a control freak to overlook gaps; in fact, another conductor had an entirely different type of control issue. Richard Strauss might be known as one of the great composers of the late romantic period, composing operas like Der Rosenkavalier and Elektra. And although he was also a great conductor, Strauss had a different type of control issue when compared to Muti.  Strauss would literally play by the book; he would stay deeply focused on the sheet music in front of him, even when he conducted his own compositions – compositions that he almost certainly knew inside and out. Since there was no room for interpretation in his orchestra, there wasn’t any room for innovation, either. What can we learn about leadership from this? We should appoint someone else to execute a plan that we ourselves have come up with. This will be more likely to induce new interpretations and, thus, innovation. If you want to learn about how conductors work their magic, there are two in particular you simply must know of: Herbert von Karajan and Leonard Bernstein. These two men were masters of getting their orchestras to harness the power of gaps.  Herbert von Karajan was the leader of the Berlin Philharmonic for 35 years, during which time he elevated the orchestra to new heights.  How? By putting things in reverse.  Instead of striking the baton down on each beat in a bar, von Karajan was known to make a slight upward motion. This created a gap that made it necessary for musicians to maintain constant communication with each other.  The musicians responded to this by learning to signal the beat amongst themselves, by moving their whole bodies while playing! This created a powerfully communicative relationship within the orchestra. The Berlin Philharmonic has since become such a strong unit of performers that it’s widely known as the best orchestra in the world.  Leonard Bernstein demonstrated a similarly innovative approach to his role as conductor. As one of the greatest conductors of the 20th century, Bernstein had a unique interest in creating dialogue with each member of the orchestra. For Bernstein, all players should feel that they had their own voice, rather than just being tools for his vision.  How did he achieve this? By creating a warm space where everyone felt comfortable interacting with each other.  When Bernstein was set to conduct the Vienna Philharmonic playing Mozart, he showed up dressed in traditional Austrian attire and learned some Austrian phrases. Among the first things he told the musicians was how flattered he was to be able to listen to them and learn how to play Mozart.  The members of the orchestra warmed to Bernstein immediately, which got their working relationship off to a flying start. The key message in this book: Don’t mind the gaps, use them! Conductors and orchestras have benefited from leadership styles that encourage interpretation and lively dialogue, and so too can your organization. By learning to listen to your team members and showing that you have faith in them, you’ll be able to develop working relationships that keep your company running as smoothly as a Philharmonic performance.  Actionable advice: Avoid routine! Routines act as a sealing mechanism for gaps, and since gaps are places where you can explore new ideas and get new perspectives, routines should be avoided. Instead of just thinking about someone who cleans your office as the cleaner, think about what you could learn from him or her. Explore the gaps in how the two of you view the work being done in the office, the team spirit being shown (or the lack thereof) and so on.

This is usually viewed as an ethical problem, but what if it’s also a business problem? What if a lack of inclusion is actually bad for your bottom line? In The Inclusion Dividend the authors show how biases and a lack of inclusion influences more parts of business than we might think. They also provide us with ideas and programs to tackle the issues and create a more inclusive environment that isn’t only good for employees, but also good for business. In these blinks, you’ll discover why MIT professor Sendil Mullainathan sent out 5,000 applications for jobs; how Apple extended its inclusion program to vendors; and why two million of America’s best and brightest left their jobs in 2007. Have you ever had the disappointing experience of putting in long hours and being the best in your workplace, only to discover that success doesn’t always boil down to hard work? That’s because while the idea of meritocracy is deeply engrained in the business world, it might not be the reality.  But what is a meritocracy exactly? It’s the long-held belief that hard work will be rewarded. In fact, it’s even the basis of the American Dream – the idea that anyone can reap the benefits of a rewarding and comfortable life by putting in the necessary work.  So, if you asked a board member of a Fortune 1000 company whether their corporation abides by a meritocratic system they would naturally say yes. They would maintain that employees are hired, promoted and kept on board solely on account of their abilities.  Unfortunately, this claim doesn’t quite align with reality. For instance, in the United States, about half the population is female, but a census conducted in 2010 by Catalyst found that women only accounted for 15% of all executive positions at Fortune 500 companies. When women were asked why they thought this was, they said the problem was due to a lack of opportunities for promotion and respect. So, now you know a meritocratic system doesn’t exist, but did you know that low diversity is actually bad for business? Just consider the fact that global corporations spend about $8 billion annually to foster a more inclusive corporate culture. They don’t just do it to avoid discrimination lawsuits, but because it makes them money.  For instance, take the companies listed on Standard and Poor’s 500 stock index. They’re profitable companies that brought in an 89% return on their investments over a three-year period. But the S&P corporations that also made it onto Working Mother’s 100 top companies for inclusion brought back 98% on every dollar invested! Have you ever been left wondering why you didn’t land an interview even though your application was loads better than your competitor’s? You might have been a victim of unconscious bias.  What’s that? Well, bias is an ever present human characteristic that’s hard to avoid; it’s a prejudice that you hold against other things or people. For instance, you might be biased toward thinking your home sports team is the best because you grew up rooting for them, even though you know they’re not so great.  Biases help you navigate the world by allowing you to rapidly react based on instinct. But while having an opinion without conscious thought is helpful for simple decisions, it can also have negative impacts, especially if you’re unaware of your biases.  Which brings us to unconscious biases: the judgments you make about others without being aware of why. For instance, an employee might earn a promotion simply because he went to the same college as his boss. The boss might not consciously intend to make choices this way –  he might just have positive associations with his alma mater.  But unconscious biases can cause bigger problems when they spur behavior that influences the workplace. That’s because biases don’t just affect your thoughts, they affect your actions too. For example, the MIT professor Sendil Mullainathan conducted a study in which he sent out about 5,000 resumés for 1,300 jobs.  The goal was to determine whether highly skilled applicants would receive differential treatment simply based on changing their names. So, while one group of applications bore names that sounded Caucasian, the names of another group sounded African American. Here are the results. For one, the white-sounding applicants had a 50% higher chance of landing an interview in general, but were also more likely to get an interview than highly skilled applicants with names that sounded African American. It was even true for companies making an active effort to diversify. So, unconscious bias might go against your intentions and cause you to miss out on great opportunities, like hiring star employees.  Most people are right handed and few right-handers ever consider what life is like for their left-handed peers – everything from can openers to tape measures are awkward to use. It’s just one example, but being unaware of more common differences exacerbates insider-outsider dynamics. What’s that? Well, every team within a greater organization is divided into insider-outsider groups based on any number of factors like age, sex, class, what college you attended and even where you grew up. As a result of these groupings, a power dynamic emerges in which the people in the insider group dominate those in the outsider group, in other words, those who are different.  For instance, a common inside group in many companies is comprised of men who attended Ivy league schools. Members of this group are more likely to give orders and tend to have more say in company decisions than women or people who didn’t graduate from an Ivy League university.  The issue is that being unaware of insider-outsider dynamics can cause imbalances in the workplace. For example, say a meeting is held in which female employees brainstorm some great ideas, but their genius is overshadowed by their male peers who disproportionately engage with one another.  Failing to address such power dynamics won’t just cost you brilliant ideas, it will also render your workforce unstable and dissatisfied. That’s because strong insider dynamics result in both decreased productivity and creativity. For instance, someone in the outside group might understand an issue better than anyone else on their team but be powerless to make productive changes. Just think of trying to break into a female-dominated market. The women on staff would be best equipped with the necessary knowledge but if they’re disempowered their suggestions will fall on deaf ears.  Another issue is that unfair power dynamics cost companies highly skilled employees. For example, a study published in 2007 by the Level Playing Institute discovered that two million professionals who were not white, heterosexual men, quit their jobs every year as a result of such power dynamics. So, a lack of diversity is bad for your company, but you can change that by looking within your firm as well as beyond it.  How? By using an Inclusion Initiative Phases or IIP model, a technique the authors developed for ensuring long-term, sustainable inclusion at any organization.  Here’s how it works. The program is comprised of four phases designed to increase the diversity and inclusivity of your company. The four steps build a structure through which any company can forge their own path to inclusion, and it’s easy to get started: Phase one is called Research and Needs Identification. In this phase you’ll gather information through employee engagement surveys, focus groups and interviews to better understand your staff.  Phase two is Strategy Creation, and to build a good strategy you need strong data, a clear path to profitability, and finally, a realistic plan for implementation. In the best scenario you’ll have a diverse team overseeing the process from start to finish.  Phase three is Implementation and Integration, a time to put your strategy into direct action. The key to this phase is to ensure that your employees don’t view the activities they’re made to participate in as a burden.  In Phase four you’ll conduct Measurement and Re-calibration to constantly evaluate what works best about the other phases, especially number three. Once you know what techniques are most effective you should amplify them while letting go of those that failed.  What will you gain by doing all this? Well, when inclusivity increases the impact isn’t just felt in the office. It also affects the ways you can market your company. That’s because customers are the most important aspect of any business venture and in many ways reflect the companies they buy from.  For instance, business research commonly shows a correlation between the experience of employees and that of customers. Therefore, if you only employ white men, you’re likely to only have white male customers. On the other hand, a diverse company will have more diverse customers and be more successful! So you’re ready to make your company more inclusive, but it won’t happen without some effort. While inclusivity is a group effort, it’s best implemented from the top down, and to change their business, company leaders need to change themselves.  That’s because growth in the modern era means reaching a global market that’s both diverse and complex. To do so you’ll need to develop interpersonal relationships with all kinds of people. For instance, Apple embraced inclusion to this end. In 1993 their executives expanded their pre-existing diversity programs by adding a supplier diversity initiative, which required the company’s suppliers to also adhere to certain diversity standards.  The result? In 2011 Apple was bringing in the largest profit per employee of any company in the world, with each employee generating $400,000 a year. Not just that, but because the inclusivity encompasses program employees, vendors and suppliers, Apple is one of the most successful brands today! So a company won’t change unless the people in charge also change, and business leaders can reap big rewards by challenging themselves in diversity. For instance, one technique is to audit oneself, a process that requires you to take a good look at your own biases. Because while turning a critical eye on your prejudices and relationships can be uncomfortable, it will help you build relationships with people different from yourself, just as Apple did with its suppliers. In fact, adopting an inclusive style of leadership can even build a real meritocracy. That’s because every leader can make the meritocracy they desire more of a reality by critically examining the company’s culture. For instance, bosses should pay more attention to company taboos like the informal relationships and unspoken agreements between employees. The culture at any company is mainly a product of the leadership, so if a leader acknowledges the absence of a real meritocracy and goes as far as challenging his or her own unconscious biases, the commitment to inclusion is likely to affect the rest of the company. The key message in this book: It’s a struggle to find instances of true meritocracy among companies today, and there’s much to be done before the playing field can be considered level for employees. The good news is that increased diversity and inclusion can ensure equality in a workplace while also boosting the profitability of any business.  Actionable advice: Keep your biases in mind the next time you’re recruiting. The next time you’re conducting an interview pay attention to any prejudices you might hold toward the prospective employee. Are your biases causing you to write them off despite their stellar qualifications? Don’t let your predispositions cost you the top talent your company needs!

Malone","summary":"Businesses across the globe are constantly searching for that visionary leader who can turn a company into a global player, a personality who can guide a firm through tough times to future success. The truth is that many companies fail because such a leader cannot be found. Global technology company Intel, however, had great leadership. Yet its strength rested not in one leader, but in three – men who today are considered some of the greatest business minds of the twentieth century. These blinks show you how the complementary skills and abilities of Gordon Moore, Bob Noyce and Andy Grove allowed Intel to massively outpace the competition. In these blinks you’ll discover why Intel’s visionary leaders needed a “business brain” too; which of Intel’s top brass was terrified of sacking employees; and why three is truly a magic number. Regardless of a tech device’s outside appearance, like your smartphone or laptop, it needs microprocessors inside to function. The microprocessor is perhaps the most important technological invention of our modern world, and its development is largely due to an incredibly influential company, Intel. In fact, the impact of the microprocessor has been so significant that Intel could be considered the most important company in the world. For the last 40 years, Intel has been at the forefront of the microprocessor industry, managing tough competition from companies such as Hewlett-Packard. And it has been very successful. In 2000, Intel was valued at almost $500 billion, a valuation larger than the American car sector combined. At the time, these kinds of numbers just weren’t seen in the tech industry. Only Apple has come close, and many years later. So what was Intel’s secret? Many point to the personalities in the company’s boardroom. According to management theorist Peter Drucker, top CEOs need three character traits to succeed: good with people, thoughtful and willing to take action. Intel didn’t have one CEO that embodied all three characteristics. But it did have three unique individuals, and each person embodied one of Drucker’s necessary traits. Robert Noyce was the people man; Gordon Moore was the thinker; and Andy Grove the man of action. Together, these men formed a powerful troika, complementing each other’s strengths and weaknesses. Together, they transformed Intel into one of the most successful companies of all time. Every great company requires a charismatic, visionary leader, someone who can both come up with superb ideas and communicate effectively to get people to follow through on those ideas. Bob Noyce was the “people person” of the Intel trinity. His strong points were charisma, vision and scientific brilliance. Noyce placed a lot of importance on being loved. He would listen to everyone and was patient. His willingness to listen won him the affections of all stakeholders, be they customers, shareholders, investors, the media or government. But his charisma wasn’t to be outdone by his scientific brilliance. In fact, he co-invented the integrated circuit, one of the most important inventions of the twentieth century. Both Noyce’s charisma and scientific talents combined well with his ability to keep a big-picture perspective. He wasn’t afraid to rethink whole industries, which made him a legendary leader. For example, at Fairchild, the company Noyce and Gordon Moore left to found Intel, Noyce released a chip for $1, much less than the chip cost to produce at the time. His genius was his ability to foresee that the same chips would actually cost even less to produce in a couple of years, as technology progressed. By enticing customers with low prices, he could capture more of them in the early phases, and then make more money from them later, once production costs fell. This strategy became known as learning curve pricing, the standard pricing strategy in the tech sector. For all his positives, Noyce was also non-confrontational, indecisive and lacked essential management skills. He just couldn’t say “no” and avoided conflict as much as possible. Though he was famous for hiring the best talent, he couldn’t bring himself to fire an employee, even when the survival of the company was at stake. When he was forced to lay off 3,500 people due to mismanagement, he gave up his position as CEO and became chairman instead, thus removing himself from such tough decision-making. Opposites often attract, and this was equally true at Intel. Alongside the bold, charismatic Noyce worked the modest, bookish Gordon Moore.   Being a man of thought, Moore’s qualities were scientific prowess and precision, mixed with modesty. As the technical leader at Intel, Moore developed the eponymous Moore’s Law, which states that the number of components per integrated circuit doubles every year, thus reducing its cost in relation to its performance. Moore’s Law became the guiding force of the tech industry, the pulse that dictated progress and innovation and the key element around which Intel’s strategy and products would revolve. As a person, Moore was self-effacing and ego-free. In contrast with Noyce’s very physical presence, Moore had more of a spiritual one. To him, only technological advancement and scientific integrity mattered. Even after having become billionaires, Moore and his wife didn’t significantly change their lifestyle. For example, conversation at the dinner table with Moore revolved around geology and fishing rather than business or money. However, Moore suffered the same shortcomings as Noyce. He too was a manager unable to make day-to-day business decisions, and the research and development departments he ran at both Fairchild and Intel were undisciplined and chaotic. Andy Grove would say of Moore that, while he could answer almost any technical question quickly and accurately, he couldn’t resolve conflicts between people. Moore was sometimes unable to defend even his own point of view, despite often being correct. So with Moore in the lab working on breakthrough technologies and Noyce acting as the connection to the outside world, the team still needed a savvy, business-minded partner who could get things done. Enter Andy Grove. If Noyce and Moore were the technological visionaries, then Grove was the businessman who could harness their lofty ideas and make them a success. Grove is the last piece of the Intel trinity: the man of action. He was decisive, empirical, brutally honest and extremely well-organized, all of which helped Intel to operate at light speed and ahead of the competition. To outperform competitor Motorola, for example, Grove implemented “Operation Crush,” a cutting-edge marketing strategy designed to surpass Motorola’s efforts in just a couple of months. As chief operating officer, Grove reviewed and validated his strategy in just a week. The next week, he presented the plan to 100 salespeople. And by the following week, Grove had rounded up more than 1,000 employees to execute the plan. His business skills would also play an important role in Intel’s success with microprocessors. Although the decision to jump into the business was made without him and he was absolutely against it, he nevertheless used his skills to take the company to new heights. Grove was also wary and temperamental. Unlike Noyce and Moore, he wasn’t one of Intel’s founding members. He was an employee with a salary, and his financial stability hinged on the success of the company. This made him wary of risky strategies. It was this fear that made him so skeptical of the company’s move into microprocessors. He wanted Intel to stick to its bread and butter, which was memory chips. Thankfully, he wasn’t able to stop Moore and Noyce, who knew the move was the correct one. Had Grove quashed the idea, Intel certainly would not have become the success it turned out to be.   This is how the trinity worked. Noyce and Moore would bring together vision, confidence and technological expertise to formulate a strategy over the long term, and Grove would use his management skills to enact the plan in an efficient way. Yet the alliance wasn’t without its problems, as you’ll find out in our next blink. There’s no question that putting such vastly different personalities in a room is bound to result in a clash or two. Noyce and Moore deeply trusted one another, and Grove looked up to Moore as a mentor and scientific sage. However, Grove resented Noyce for putting on airs and being irresponsible, and in general, not caring about day-to-day business needs. Noyce would evade conflicts at meetings and act aloof, as if he wasn’t concerned about the business at hand. This enraged Grove and fueled his contempt for Noyce. According to Grove, Noyce would take on a pained look when there were conflicts, and would do anything he could to avoid them – not the behavior of a serious businessperson! For example, when Noyce decided to pursue the microprocessor project, he clearly should have talked to Grove. Perhaps fearing a potential conflict, he ignored him instead, breaking every management rule in the book to make a seriously big decision all on his own. Ultimately, Moore would often have to act as a mediator between Grove and Noyce. Yet the two men were able to put their feelings aside in the end to fully concentrate efforts to grow Intel’s businesses. Even though Grove was furious at Noyce for having initiated the microprocessor project without his knowledge, he was still the one who made it successful with his business wizardry. Noyce knew that Grove disliked him, but he nonetheless agreed that Grove should eventually become CEO. Noyce even put Grove in charge of the microprocessor launch. Noyce simply recognized that Grove was the only person who could align Intel’s operations with his own grand vision. The strong personalities of Noyce, Moore and Grove set a powerful example for the rest of the company, creating a revolutionary corporate culture that would lead to success. Since 1968, Intel’s organizational structure has been characterized by a flat hierarchy and openness. Executives didn’t get special privileges, such as executive dining rooms or reserved parking spaces. In fact, one of Intel’s top executives once got angry at his wife for showing up to the company campus in the couple’s expensive Mercedes. From that point on, he was only seen driving an ordinary sedan. Communication within the company was informal and lateral, and moved easily throughout the organizational structure. Any employee could walk up to an executive’s desk – no fancier than any other – and talk about his ideas. One example of this open communication is the chat between employee Ted Hoff and Robert Noyce about what would later become the microprocessor. At the time, Intel was struggling in the memory chip business; Noyce was intrigued with the idea and told Hoff to pursue his research. However, an informal workplace was just a characteristic of Intel’s ultimate goal: to be a peerless innovator, the best in the world and ferociously successful. It was this drive that caused Intel to introduce the standard 80-hour workweek to Silicon Valley. “Creative confrontation” was also the norm. Everything was permitted, so long as the behavior or action solved a company problem and secured its competitive position. Personal attacks were tolerated; people were shouted down at meetings. At Intel, if you made a mistake you knew it and were reminded of it ruthlessly. The next day you would work twice as hard, however, and everything would be forgotten. This mix of drive to be the best and a flat hierarchy made it possible for Intel to quickly adjust to new challenges. Its pride and confidence led it to take risks, and yet it always found a way to grow stronger. The key message in this book: Great success is defined by great people. With Intel, success was based on the partnership among three men, whose distinct personalities and strong desire to succeed were unmatched.  Suggested further reading: Moore’s Law by Arnold Thackray, David Brock and Rachel Jones Moore's Law (2015) tells the story of Gordon Moore, a chemist from San Francisco who helped revolutionize the technology industry. Over the years, Moore’s innovations have fundamentally changed all kinds of electronic technology, from digital watches and personal computers to the internet and Facebook. Got feedback?

They were fed up with their fans using the site to steal or copy their music for free. Metallica’s opinion is common in the creative industries: If you want to benefit from the fruits of our creativity, they say, you have to pay for it. Yet, as prevalent as this idea is, it’s wrong! Imitation and copying, far from robbing creative talents of their work, can in most cases bring them increased benefits. As these blinks show, many industries from fashion to sports have benefitted greatly from people copying and imitating. In these blinks you’ll discover why no chef is really original; why Radiohead made more money when they gave their album away free; and what happened to the Encarta encyclopedia. In any discussion on copyright law, you’ll often hear that copying and imitation damage creativity and innovation. People believe that copying is cheaper than creating, which in turn reduces the incentive to innovate. After all, why spend all your time and money coming up with the best idea if you could just copy it instead? But the industries that are the most creative are not even protected by copyright laws. Copying is simply a matter of course in fashion, and yet the industry thrives nevertheless. In fact, data from the US Bureau of Labor shows that, from 1998 to 2012, the average price of garments has remained virtually unchanged. The companies whose goods are often copied produce the highest priced garments, and one might think that copying would hurt their bottom line. In reality, these brands flourish, despite selling their garments at 250 percent the price of the copying competition. In the same vein, there is no copyright protection for recipes. Despite this, many believe the culinary world is at a creative peak. If you are a chef whose prized recipe is copied, your reputation as an inventive cook is burnished. Thomas Keller’s dish “Oyster and Pearls,” for example, has been widely copied. Did it run him out of business? No. In fact, it brought Keller’s restaurant The French Laundry – and Keller himself – international recognition and success. Furthermore, industries that promote strict copyright laws are not necessarily more creative. Industries such as music and film, which have more stringent protections against copying, have actually been experiencing a decline in their markets. These protections, rather than simply hindering pirating, can make it harder for new competitors who could have been at the forefront of  innovation in the field to freely sample existing work in their own creations. Obviously there are industries where copying is prevalent, and they are nonetheless creative, but in some areas copying is part of the creative culture. In some fields, copying isn’t a nuisance to be stamped out. Rather, it’s the way the field functions. In these fields, creativity and innovation exist through the act of copying itself. Some markets enjoy a high level of creativity whose success is driven by the fact that work is constantly imitated and copied. Open-source computer programming, for example, is a highly creative market – one in which all the source code for any particular program can be copied at any time. This model has proven incredibly successful. Indeed, 25 percent of all corporate servers run the open-source operating system Linux. More than half run Apache, an open-source web server software. The free and open-source web browser Mozilla Firefox has more than 150 million users. Each of these programs develops and grows precisely because of their simplicity and availability for copying. Copying is likewise an integral part of the culinary world, where aspiring chefs copy recipes and techniques to refine their craft and sharpen their taste. The culinary world demonstrated its awareness of the importance of copying in 2006, when three of the most innovative chefs of recent decades, Ferran Adrià, Heston Blumenthal and Thomas Keller, published a manifesto in the Guardian, declaring that the best culinary traditions are “collective, cumulative inventions.” What’s more, nonprofit, shared, creative materials can actually be more successful than the versions of those products that are protected by copyright. Take Wikipedia, for example. It is written by anonymous, unpaid contributors who know that their material can be copied by anyone at any time as long as Wikipedia is credited. And yet it is today’s most extensive encyclopedia, with more than 20 million entries. Compare this to Microsoft’s now defunct encyclopedia Encarta, which had only 62,000 entries despite its copyright protection and considerable resources. When you think of Thomas Edison, the first thing that comes to mind is: “Oh, yeah. He’s the guy who invented the lightbulb.” But was this invention, for which he has won so much renown, a completely new idea? Or did he build upon others’ work? Edison’s designs were actually variations on ideas from a number of different proto-lightbulbs, which eventually led to what we now know as the lightbulb. Indeed, by imitating and tweaking ideas and inventions that already exist, we are able to widely expand innovation. Fonts, for example, which aren’t protected by copyright laws, are extremely easy to copy and tweak. Because these symbols remain unprotected, innovators have had the opportunity to create new, interesting fonts based on existing ones. Even one of the most used fonts in the world today, Microsoft’s Arial, was created as a way to avoid paying licensing fees for an existing font. This kind of copying and tweaking has resulted in an explosion in the amount of fonts available to users. A survey conducted in 1990 showed there to be around 44,000 fonts. In 2002 that number was revised to 100,000, and 2012 the number of fonts reached 170,232! Furthermore, copying speeds up market cycles and puts immense pressure on companies to innovate if they want to earn their place at the forefront of the market. We see this clearly in the fashion world, where copies of name brand articles by less expensive brands cause those goods to fall out of fashion. While you need enough people wearing your designs to make them “trendy,” their value diminishes as more and more people start wearing the same item. Thus designers whose articles are copied have to work hard to create new items, and this increase in tempo leads to increased innovation. We don’t always need laws to protect intellectual property. In fact, there are strong social norms within several of the fields not protected by copyright law that keep copying from becoming degenerate. In the world of comedy we find that while comedians are not protected by copyright law, there is nonetheless a pact among them not to steal material from one another. When comedian Dane Cook was accused of stealing material from Louis C.K., he was shunned by other comedians and received hefty criticism from his peers. These criticisms weren’t without consequence: Cook has called the time after the accusations emerged the hardest in his life. Similarly, a 2008 study on highly esteemed French chefs showed that while they borrow extensively from one another, they don’t copy recipes exactly. The study also showed that when chefs disclose information about their dishes to other chefs, the trade secrets aren’t passed on without permission. And when permission was given, the original chef would receive proper recognition. What’s more, consumers are able to discern copycats, and often prefer to have the original product over the copy. In the example of Cook and Louis C.K., fans joined in the conversation. Even though Louis C.K. didn’t bring the issue to light or comment on it, fans who had discovered the similarities accused Cook of plagiarism, both in blogs and anonymous videos on YouTube. In fashion, a large part of the consumer experience is the social status granted by the garments. Copies generally convey less status. So wearing the right brand and being the first to do so upholds the status of the originals. An original Louis Vuitton bag, for example, carries much more status than a copy bought in a knock-off market in Thailand. It certainly doesn’t seem like copying is going away anytime soon. So how does the future look for innovation in a world with more copying? It’s easy to see how companies with strong intellectual property protection can stay ahead. All they have to do is submit a patent. But how exactly do companies compete when copying is abundant? Competition drives innovation through the process of tweaking, or copying something that already exists, and improving it with small alterations. We can see tweaking in action on the football field every Monday evening, when NFL coaches copy and improve upon plays to keep up with their competitors. Even the legendary Steve Jobs of Apple has been described as a tweaker rather than an innovator. Indeed, one of the last innovations credited to Jobs, Apple’s iPad, was essentially a tweak of an idea from its competitor Microsoft. In the financial industry copying and tweaking investment strategies is another way for investors to stay ahead of the competition. For example, when John Bogle invented the first index fund – an investment strategy designed to emulate the average performance of stocks on the stock market – his contemporaries were unimpressed. At first they scoffed, and even took to calling his grand idea “Bogle’s folly.” By 2001, however, there were more than 400 index funds in the American market. In spite of the fact that Bogle’s strategy has been so prolifically copied, his company, The Vanguard Group, is still the leading provider of index funds. Even some of the most highly competitive industries, such as tech and finance, are full of copying, imitating and tweaking. And yet none of these industries have come crashing down. Instead, they serve as prime examples of the kinds of innovation that copying and tweaking can bring to the table. With every pirated copy of a hot new album, music industry executives lament the end of an era. But does copying actually threaten the industry? Or does it simply force change? The record industry has indeed struggled as a result of file sharing, but this hasn’t stopped artists from creating new music, and creativity still thrives. Though the industry might suggest otherwise, musicians don’t necessarily need the music industry’s institutions to be successful. Radiohead proved this in 2007, with the online release of their album In Rainbows. Downloaders paid by donation, giving whatever they wanted to or whatever they could afford. So how did this model affect the album’s profitability? A year after the release of In Rainbows, Radiohead’s licencing agent confirmed that the album had made more money than the band’s previous record, Hail to the Thief, which had been released in the traditional manner by EMI. While record sales decline, musicians are earning more money from live shows today than before. In the United States, ticket revenues for live shows have more than tripled from 1999 to 2009, jumping from $1.5 billion to $4.6 billion, which interestingly correlates with plummeting record sales. Clearly, copying hasn’t meant the death of the industry, and the same is true for film. Today, it is exceedingly easy to create copies of movies through streaming or file sharing. You would think that this would kill movie sales, but this hasn’t been the case for theaters that focus on the movie-going experience. The Arclight movie theater chain in California, for example, charges twice the US average for tickets. How do they get away with it? By elevating the movie-going experience with larger, more comfortable seating, top of the line audio and visual equipment and a user-friendly booking system. In fact, they’re so successful that they’ve opened three new theaters in just a few years. In a world where imitation and copying seem more and more commonplace, how can innovative companies stay successful? For one, having your work copied can act as a sort of advertising for your original product. By utilizing this “advertising effect,” innovators can gain an advantage over their competitors. This was demonstrated by a study conducted by Renee Gosline of MIT, which showed that copies can act as “trial versions” of the original product. The two-and-half-year-long study showed that as many as 40 percent of those who bought a knock-off handbag eventually decided to buy the original. A similar study of 31 shoe companies showed that counterfeiting actually had a positive impact on sales. Why? Because the high visibility of copies worn in the street made the genuine objects more desirable. Moreover, the technology that has made copying easier can also be used to help companies stay relevant and competitive in the future. Companies working with an open-source model, for example, are able to use the power of imitation and tweaking to promote other services and products they produce. The tech giant IBM, for instance, employs 600 people to develop the Linux operating system. While Linux doesn’t earn them money directly, they have recognized that the normal servers and hardware they sell will benefit from a market where there are several different operating systems. Yet another open-source operating system, Google’s Android, is now the largest mobile platform in the United States. Since it is licence-free, Google doesn’t make money from the operating system itself. Rather, they earn money by ensuring that consumers use Google’s search engine in order to profit from search-related ads. As the development of technology and the speed of our global economy continue to accelerate, copying will not become less ubiquitous, but rather the opposite. Learning how to turn this into an advantage will be one way to ensure future success. The key message in this book: People often picture copyright laws as the shield that protects innovators from pirates who would destroy creative industry. However, copying isn’t a bane. In fact, it’s a boon to creative fields! Imitation, copying and tweaking are the foundation for innovation in today’s world.

Every snake oil salesperson seems to be pushing a new book devoted to leadership skills and management. It’s a hot topic and everyone seems to have a opinion. Not that all of these books are bad of course. Some come packed with interesting anecdotes and lengthy theories. They may even make you laugh. But when it comes to actual practice, they’re often distinctly lacking. And in leadership, what matters is results. What you need is guidance, some clear advice and easy-to-implement leadership skills, obtainable through simple steps and training exercises. This is where these blinks will help. They will introduce you to a technique you can use to become a better leader. The “leader habit” can be learned through simple exercises, responding to cues that occur in everyday situations. What’s more these exercises only require a few minutes’ work at a time. Step by step, you’ll build new habits that will assist you in becoming a better leader, more attuned to and aware of the world and the people around you. In these blinks you’ll learn: what grumpy customers are really trying to communicate; how a pizza delivery team became better drivers en masse; and how to identify and improve a poorly performing team. It makes little difference what field you work in – leadership skills matter. And we’re not just talking about company management here; these skills even make a difference when you’re running a household. So, how do you actually become a better leader? Leadership theorists used to argue that great leaders were genetically gifted, predisposed to behave as leaders. However, studies have disproved that view. We now know that 70 percent of the qualities associated with great leadership are learned behaviors. In response to this discovery, since 1996 there has been a massive boom in leadership development literature. Yet, this has hardly led to a new generation of gifted leaders. Worse, evidence suggests that there is a negative correlation between the rise in prominence of the field, and the confidence that Americans have in their leaders. If books aren’t working, what’s the best way to learn about leadership? Rather than seeing leadership as learnable knowledge, it would help to think of it as a set of skills. A skill can be learned through exercises, training your automatic behavior so that a habit is developed. Let’s look at the example of Laura. She was an emergency room nurse who was repeatedly passed over for management roles. Laura hadn’t noticed that her colleagues saw her as abrupt, emotionally erratic and argumentative. In short, she was hardly leadership material. To polish her CV and ensure she got the promotion she desired, Laura decided to take part in the author’s leadership development program. She learned to practice an important exercise: asking colleagues open-ended questions that ideally hinged on “What” or “How.” To remind herself to do this, she made a note on her hand. She soon found that her colleagues were a lot more responsive if she asked for their opinions. Using this technique, her relationships began to improve and her confidence grew. You too could try adapting your behavior in this manner, and developing this simple habit. Soon enough, Laura didn’t need written reminders. She not only succeeded in getting the management position she aspired to, but her relationships with friends and family members improved. All it took was training in the right skills. But how do you do this? The following blinks will introduce you the author’s Leader Habit Formula. The idea is that the habits essential for leadership can be practiced with simple five-minute training exercises. Learning new skills takes time. Just think of a piano player. She doesn’t sit down to play a sonata from start to finish the first time around. Instead, she learns it section by section, little by little, repeating it often. The same is true of leadership development. When the author Martin Lanik developed the Leader Habit Formula, he identified core leadership skills. He then compartmentalized these into microbehaviors. In essence, then, habits are ingrained microbehaviors. Lanik wanted to be sure of which habits would be the most critical for leadership. He and his research team decided to evaluate over 800 global leaders, using their research to establish two leadership categories: Getting Things Done and Focusing on People. They determined that the best leaders showed skills in both aspects, but generally excelled at one over the other. Each category encompassed three groups of skills. In total, 22 core skills were split between the six groups. The first category of Getting Things Done, for instance, included the skills Planning and Execution. The core skills within the group included Manage Priorities, Plan and Organize Work, Delegate Well and Create Urgency. The author and his team didn’t stop there. They wanted to really boil down the skills into their essential components, so that each could be easily developed. Consequently, they determined that 79 microbehaviors were present within the 22 skills. If a potential leader could acquire one microbehavior at a time, then he would ultimately be able to link a series of microbehaviors, and so master a complex skill. Let’s look at the core skill Manage Priorities. The microbehaviors that make up this skill involve dividing a project into explicit tasks, establishing a hierarchy of importance within the tasks, estimating a task’s completion time and ensuring that the logic governing prioritization is clear to all involved with the project. The idea is to develop each of these microbehaviors in yourself so that they’re completely automatic before you start the next one. This is known as chaining. Once you’re able to practice chaining, you’ll start learning the much more difficult skill of prioritizing within the teams you manage, as well as within your personal life. You know the score. New Year’s rolls around, and you convince yourself that splashing out on a gym membership is the way to go. But, if you’re like millions of others, that resolution barely makes it to February. There’s no shame in this though: it’s proof that developing a new habit is no easy task. This is where the Leader Habit Formula comes in. Its foundation is a cycle of cues, behaviors and rewards. It develops automatized patterns of behavior that eventually require little effort. Once they’re set, sound habits will follow. Let’s look at this in detail. In the Leader Habit Formula, microbehaviors are linked to a cue. These are then cultivated with a simple exercise to assist habit development. One microbehavior required for Influencing Others is working out unstated or implied questions that others might have. By doing this, you can better fulfil their needs. The cue for this microbehavior is hearing someone complain. A cue like this occurs in real time and comes about naturally with no need for further prodding. This means that it’s scientifically easier to remember, say, than some note you’ve just scribbled on a piece of paper. What’s needed now is a simple and efficient exercise that you can use to influence others. So, the next time you hear someone kicking up a fuss, thank them for their concern and address it directly: What exactly do they want? For example, a customer bemoaning a one-off late fee on a subscription payment most likely wants to have the fee waived on this occasion. The next stage in the Leader Habit Formula is focusing on those microbehaviors that are loaded with inbuilt rewards. A microbehavior is intrinsically rewarding to you if it shares something in common with your personality. First, you’ll have to figure out what your personality type is. If you take the Leader Habit Quiz online, you’ll also learn which skills you’ll find most easy to amplify. For instance, if the quiz shows that you’re naturally a little reserved, but also very caring, it’ll indicate Active Listening as a behavior that is likely to be intrinsically rewarding to you. You’ll be surprised at just how much you appreciate working on tasks with intrinsic rewards. Studies have shown that compensation of this kind is far more individually valued than splashy, expensive rewards like vacations or shopping sprees. Learning a microbehavior doesn’t happen overnight. In fact, it takes an average of 66 days. If you worked it out, you might reckon that the 79 microbehaviors we referred to in blink two would take more than 14 years to master. Thankfully, there’s a shortcut you can use so that you don’t need to learn the habits one by one. It’s called a Keystone Habit, and one such habit can encourage the correction of other habits. Behavior analysts at Virginia Polytechnic Institute noticed this phenomenon while trying to encourage pizza delivery drivers to wear seat belts. They found that discussing the benefits of seat belts and putting up signs about safety around the office had an additional subsidiary effect: not only did the drivers buckle up more, they also started using their indicator signals more. In other words, wearing seat belts was a Keystone Habit connected to other safe driving habits. Keystone Habits can also be applied to leadership skills. For instance, if you work on better decision making, you’ll find that your ability to analyze information, amongst other abilities, will also improve. In practice, try getting to grips with a Keystone Habit from both of the categories Getting Things Done or Focusing on People. Another benefit of Keystone Habits are that they can enhance your self-image, making it likelier that you’ll keep developing leadership skills. John is a good example of this. He was finding it tough to get promoted to an executive position, as colleagues thought he was too authoritarian. The author tasked John with asking for other people’s views whenever they indicated that they were dissatisfied. John soon learned that, by simply listening to the responses, he began respecting people’s concerns. As a result, others were soon more disposed to listen to his own ideas. Here’s where it gets interesting. The exercise also fostered other skills in John. Soon after his desired promotion, John had to give some negative feedback to an underperforming director. Much to his surprise, he found himself turning what could have been an awkward discussion into a full-blown coaching session. Evidently, he’d learned something about mentoring along his journey! It was just the first step. As John began to utilize his improved leadership abilities, he discovered he also had the capacity to influence people, negotiate and overcome resistance. Do you think of yourself more as a task-oriented leader, or a people-oriented leader? First and foremost, if you’re going to lead a  team you must be able to get stuff finished. In short you’ll need to become more efficient at task-oriented behaviors. Let’s look more closely at Plan and Organize Work, a skill that is essential for successfully completing tasks. It forms part of Getting Things Done. The idea is to frame delegation work and resources in a way that a team can easily understand. The first microbehavior demanded here is the creation of a detailed project plan. This plan should contain information regarding individual task responsibilities and a clear set of deadlines. When the project is next discussed, be sure to give the team a few minutes to suggest one actionable task and its associated deadline. For instance, they could set themselves a deadline of September 20, by which they need to produce the draft of a new brochure. The next group of skills falls under the heading Solving Problems and Decision Making. These are Analyze Information, Think Through Solutions, Make Good Decisions and Focus on Customers. Finding a Common Theme is an essential microbehavior needed for analyzing information. Try it out. When you next find yourself thinking about a problem, list it out using clear bullet points. Then spend a few moments trying to identify a common theme. Imagine, for instance, that your employees have been clashing, missing deadlines and working on finishing the wrong tasks. What’s the common theme here? It’s simple: your team lacks coordination. There is one final skill set that forms part of the Getting Things Done category. This is Leading Change. It breaks down into: Sell the Vision, Innovate and Manage Risk. All habit-making exercises will ultimately mold your leadership abilities. If you’re set on becoming a better innovator, try brainstorming creative solutions to a problem. The next time you’re faced with an issue, take five minutes to think about what solution could be achieved – this time with infinite financial resources. The sky’s the limit! When we think about what makes a good leader, we tend to imagine people gifted with natural charisma who effortlessly influence others. But nature has nothing to do with it. With a little practice, you too can become a mover and shaker. According to a study run by the University of Central Florida, people-oriented leaders have a mild advantage in achieving results. There are three elements to people-oriented leadership skills. These are: Persuasion and Influence, Growing People and Teams, and Interpersonal Skills. The Persuasion and Influence subset is made up of three skills: Influence Others, Overcome Individual Resistance, and Negotiate Well. Let’s look specifically now at how you can learn to Overcome Individual Resistance.   If you want to lead a successful team, it’s critical that your team is ready and able to change their methods and target. However, change is often met with hostility. If you see that a team member is less than enthusiastic, you’re going to have to acknowledge their concerns. You do this by asking him what his concerns are. Once you’ve addressed the specific challenges that concern him, you’ll be able to successfully assist him in overcoming his fears. The trick is to  highlight the benefits of change and identify the areas where you see eye-to-eye. The next skill set that forms part of people-oriented leadership is Growing People and Teams. The skills here are: Empower Others, Mentor and Coach, and Build Team Spirit. Take Empower Others. If you find allowing others to make decisions difficult, you’ll need to train yourself in empowering others. When someone next conveys their misgivings or starts venting, be sure to demonstrate your support. At the same time, don’t just bail him out of his responsibilities. Instead acknowledge his concerns, and ask how you can help. Finally, the Interpersonal Skills required for people-oriented leadership include learning to Build Strategic Relationships, Show Care, Listen Actively, Communicate Clearly, and Speak with Charisma. Let’s look at the last one, Speak with Charisma. It’s not actually that hard to become a charismatic speaker, you just have to fire up the imagination. You can start by using vivid metaphors and sparkling similes. For example, if you’re pushing a new dental hygiene app, what about comparing it to the fitness tracking device Fitbit – but for teeth! The path to becoming a better leader is plain enough. Step by step, if you layer good habit upon good habit, you’ll find yourself with a network of behaviors that will precipitate exactly those skills that you’re going to need as a world-class leader. The key message in these blinks: Leadership isn’t about knowledge – it’s best understood as a series of habits that link leadership microbehaviors to specific cues. If you can change the way you respond to situations, it’s possible to develop exemplary leadership skills. Five minutes a day is all you need. In using the power of chaining and establishing keystone habits, you’ll fast-track your development and improve your self-image so that you can become an effective leader. Actionable advice: Develop team-building activities to create team spirit.  In order to lead a successful team, you need to facilitate cohesion by creating a sense of team spirit. When you think of team-building activities, you probably think of after-work drinks or bowling. But team-building should be a habit that is implemented on a daily basis. The next time you communicate with someone – either in person or by email – take five minutes to put her in touch with another person from whom you think she could benefit. This could be personal or professional – just tell her why you think she would enjoy meeting that person. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

What to read next: The Coaching Habit, by Michael Bungay Stanier In these blinks you’ve learned what it takes, in practice, to become a great leader.

Sometimes you have to be ready to coach and mentor. The blinks to The Coaching Habit (2016) shows just how coaching works, component by component.

A Mensch is a man or woman with integrity and honor – a stalwart human being. The traits that constitute a Mensch – or, for that matter, any truly great leader – have a tree-like structure. Just as a tree has roots, a trunk and branches and leaves, a Mensch has traits that root her firmly to the ground, others that keep her upright and some that provide a comfortable shade for those she leads. When all these traits are combined, you get a leader that inspires others and can create a creative atmosphere in which people do their best work. But what exactly are these traits? In these blinks, you’ll also learn why former NFL player Anthony Kevin Dungy never brags; why a sense of responsibility is crucial in a leader; and what a cleaning lady has to do with curing cancer. We all know that a tree without roots doesn’t stand a chance. It’ll fail to grow and a gust of wind could bring it crashing down. Well, the same goes for leaders. But what makes the solid roots of a great leader – or, in the author’s words, a great Mensch? First off, humility helps a Mensch view things through the eyes of a novice, and this opens the door to infinite possibilities. Just take Anthony Kevin Dungy, a former NFL player and the current coach of the Indianapolis Colts. Despite his innumerable accomplishments, he never brags or even talks about himself. Rather, he teaches his players in a toned-down, humble manner. He listens to their thoughts and is constantly learning himself. The second thing about Mensch leaders is their awareness that sticking to their values will enable them to make a unique contribution to the world. Or, to put it simply, they’re authentic. That means they stick to what they know is right, no matter what. For instance, if a Mensch profoundly cares for the environment, but learns he can make more money by using unsustainable materials, he’ll ignore that option altogether. This is a key Mensch quality because it makes those around them happier and more respectful. And finally, the third root of Mensch leaders is empathy, which helps them build trust by making others feel safe and understood. For instance, a Mensch takes into consideration how others feel about themselves during interactions. By being present and focusing entirely during any conversation, a Mensch shows others that he cares about what they have to say. But empathy doesn’t mean you have to make everyone like you. To paraphrase former US Secretary of State, Colin Powell: if you try to please everybody, you’ll avoid tough choices and shy away from confronting people when you should. According to him, this will only lead to your coming off as fake and untrustworthy. Okay, now that you know what gives a great leader her roots, it’s time to look at some above-ground attributes. It goes without saying that the first thing a leader should be is optimistic. Without optimism, a leader can neither inspire nor convince – but, beyond that, there are two essential pieces to a Mensch’s “trunk.” The first is a willingness to take responsibility. After all, nobody wants to do a bad job and, when that inevitable misstep occurs, it takes courage to do the right thing: to be responsible and fix what went wrong. Not just that, but being honest and admitting you made a mistake will help you maintain the trusting relationships you’ve established with others. Just take Michael McCain, the CEO of Maple Leaf Foods. When the company became implicated in the spread of a foodborne illness, he publicly announced that the company’s best efforts had failed and that it was their job to fix the problem. So, responsibility is the first essential piece of a Mensch’s trunk. The other, equally essential piece is a resolution to live life with mastery. A true Mensch will always strive to master every dimension of her work, knowing that her every interaction can inspire others to do their best as well. A Mensch’s mastery involves staying calm, regardless of the situation. She should also be honest and clear in her communication. And, most importantly, she should listen more than she speaks. This last one may need special attention, because most people tend to be conversation stealers, interrupting others with their own stories. To overcome this, try honoring a person’s story and only offering your own once they’ve finished. This is a great skill; it will improve your communication with others, as well as your relationships in general. Now that you’ve got a picture of the roots and the trunk, it’s time to learn about the branches of a Mensch leader. The first one is a leader’s mood, which sets the tone for the organization. That’s why a Mensch is acutely aware of how his mood affects the productivity and engagement of those around him. For instance, leadership literature is loaded with studies that show how leaders set the office environment. These studies explain that more energetic and enthusiastic leaders make for more cooperative teams that work together more effectively. Just consider Whole Foods, a company that truly values a positive workplace environment. Through the positive attitudes of their leaders, they produce comfortable customer relationships that lead to repeat visits. But they also maintain complete transparency in regard to salaries, allowing everyone to see what their bosses take home. Naturally, this honesty produces an atmosphere of trust. The second branch of the Mensch leader tree is generosity toward those under one’s leadership – and that doesn’t just mean being generous with money. Generosity means many things, like giving someone a second chance or making people feel that their role, however small, is important. For instance, during staff interviews at a US cancer hospital, even the janitor reported that her role was to cure cancer. Somehow, the leader had made every single employee feel that their role was essential. And finally, Mensch leaders have confidence in themselves, which leads to self-efficacy. Self-efficacy is defined by the psychologist Albert Bandura as a belief in one’s ability to perform efficiently. It’s high self-efficacy that gives people the confidence they need to seek challenges and face failure. So, the higher your self-efficacy, the more courageous you’ll be to seek out challenges and persist through failure. This is huge, because people who think like this tend to be healthier and more successful at their jobs. Now that you know what makes a Mensch, it’s time to ask yourself a few questions to see where you stand. Before sharing your gifts and knowledge with others, it’s essential to unravel the Mensch hidden within you. Here’s how: At the end of the day, just before heading home, take a few minutes to reflect on any significant conversations you had or emails you sent. Do you feel proud? Can you do better? Allowing for such introspection will help you improve both yourself and the way you communicate with others. And self-improvement is central to leadership. After all, you can’t make people feel confident in their abilities until you’re confident in your power. Therefore, learning self-confidence is essential. You can do this by spending time with confident people, paying attention to their habits and the way they think. Or, if that’s insufficient, seeing a therapist is also a fantastic way to get to the root of the issue and establish a new, more confident foundation. Once your self-confidence is in good shape, it’s important to remember that the way you treat others will affect the success of your company. You shouldn’t be afraid to show people that you appreciate them. After all, expressing your appreciation can never do harm, but it will encourage employees to do their best and make them feel cared for and important. So, make a habit of complimenting people’s work in front of them. It’s a gift to those you lead, and it will boost their self-esteem as well as their work ethic. The key message in this book: At the core of any successful leader is the desire to be helpful and caring in the most sincere way possible. That means, as a leader, it’s your responsibility to give people the tools, support and feedback they need to excel. First, however, you’ve got to develop your inner Mensch, firmly planting your roots, establishing your trunk and letting your branches grow. Actionable advice: Be generous with praise.  The next time you want to admire someone’s work, be generous with your words. Say, “I couldn’t have done it without you!” instead of saying “I appreciated your help.” Generosity engenders generosity. If you give praise, others will continue to give their best. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

They need to coach, convince and direct their team, negotiate with business partners and represent their company in a winning way. This reads like the perfect job description for intelligent extroverts – after all, extroverts tend to be naturally eloquent and assertive, like to be the center of attention and enjoy working with others. Yet as it turns out, many highly successful leaders are introverts. In fact, introverts have particular strengths that extroverts don’t have – but to get to the top of the ladder, they had to work extra hard. Jennifer Kahnweiler interviewed more than 100 introverted professionals to learn how they harness their strengths, overcome challenges and develop strategies to succeed in an extroverted business culture. The results are summarized in these blinks. Keep on reading and you’ll find out why cocktail parties can be the biggest obstacles to an introvert’s career. You’ll also find out how being an introvert could make you look like a sluggish thinker – even if you’re the most brilliant person on earth. Finally, you’ll find out how to harness the power of introversion to get the one up on extroverts. Whether it’s in a chatty classroom or at a party, it often seems that extroverts greatly outnumber introverts. But appearances can deceive: there are actually quiet people in every walk of life – and they aren’t even a minority. In fact, introversion and extraversion are basic temperaments that are evenly distributed throughout the population. The terms extrovert and introvert were first introduced by the psychologist C.G. Jung to distinguish between two basic personality types: Introverts tend to direct their attention inward, focusing on their own thoughts, whereas extroverts are active, social and focus on their external environment. The two types also differ in how they recharge their mental batteries: extroverts are energized by social interaction, while introverts recover energy through quiet, solitary contemplation. Finally, their communication styles are different: extroverts are outspoken and decisive, whereas introverts are reserved, prefer listening to talking and ponder all their options before taking action. So how many introverts are out there? Scientists interviewed different groups of people about introverted personality traits such as needing a lot of quiet time or preferring listening to talking. The result? About 47-55 % of the US population are introverts. But what about business and politics – surely there is only place for extroverts there? Indeed, our business culture does seem to favor extroverts by emphasizing the importance of socializing, decisiveness and gregariousness over introvert traits like reflectiveness or conscientousness. Yet one study shows that no less than 40% of all executives describe themselves as introverts. The most famous of them all was probably President Abraham Lincoln, known for his tendency to frequently withdraw inside himself: he would often be found alone in his library reading law books instead of socializing. Imagine a crucial meeting where many employees are fighting to share their thoughts on a marketing problem. Each individual is competing for the boss’s limited attention – and if you’re an introvert, this is one area where you could lose out. Why? Because if you don't speak up in a meeting, your ideas may never get heard – whilst the loud and the outspoken end up with most of the desirable assignments and project funds. And of course, extroverts are much more likely to raise their voices. For example, maybe you have a great idea of how to deal with that marketing problem, but you hesitate to enter the fray. In a setting like this, even your best ideas won’t speak for themselves: to keep them from getting lost, you'll have to speak up and convince your team. And it’s not only in meetings that introverts can miss out on opportunities: if you keep a low profile at work, you might be overlooked when your boss looks for the right person to take charge.    This is because your boss may not have the time to search for the most suitable person to take on a prestigious project – so he’ll probably assign the task to someone who recently made a favorable impression. For example, if an extrovert and an introvert are both performing well, but the extrovert is also drawing more attention to his performance, he'll be more likely to get the promotion. Therefore if you want to be entrusted to take charge, you need to make sure you stay on your boss’s radar – and that he doesn’t forget about your accomplishments. So next time you see your boss, give him a subtle reminder about your performance. Everyone who's worked in an office knows that sometimes people prefer to work alone. But introverts need that alone time even more – to a point where it can be to their disadvantage. It’s important for introverts to regularly work in solitude, but it can take diplomatic skill and effort to defend this preference. This is because a typical extrovert-friendly business setting with open offices, frequent meetings and continuous teamwork can fail to provide the solitary time necessary for introverts to recharge their batteries. But extroverted colleagues might not understand an introvert’s need for solitude – and they might even feel rejected if an introverted colleague doesn’t always welcome their company. Another characteristic which disadvantages introverts is their reluctance to participate in the informal socializing between conferences or meetings. This time is often used to strengthen connections, exchange information and make deals – without the introverts. For example, on a business trip, an introverted account executive chose to spend some time alone instead of golfing with the other executives. At the official meeting, he found out that most  of the vital decisions had already been made on the green.   So introverts should just make sure they socialize more, right? Problem is, going too long without spending time alone can hurt an introvert’s performance and morale. This is because introverts tend to work best when they’re alone, and need solitude to recharge their batteries. If they continually lack alone time, they will end up exhausted and consistently less productive. After some time, they may even suffer from stress-related symptoms like headaches and back problems. In fact, an introvert with no opportunity to work alone throughout the day will be as unhappy as an extrovert passing his days in a solitary office. If you’re an introvert, make sure you plan your solitary time carefully. Imagine you’re an introvert: when your boss asks you to deal with a problem, you’ll tend to retreat to your office and take the time you need to concentrate on your assignment. Two weeks later, a staff evaluation comes up, and you’re shocked to find you’ve been criticized for working too slow and acting aloof. Being on the receiving end of this kind of misperception is common for introverts. One reason introverts are mistaken for slow thinkers is their tendency to carefully consider what they want to say and make sure it's the best answer they can offer. Extroverts on the other hand are prone to contributing a suggestion as soon as it comes to their mind – and the combination of these two thinking styles can lead extroverts to believe that introverts are slower thinkers.   For example, imagine two equally bright pupils, an extrovert and an introvert. In class, both come up with great ideas for the science fair. But the extrovert blurts out his suggestion immediately, whilst the introvert double-checks her own idea and answers much later. Result? In comparison, the introvert will appear slow – and to many, less intelligent. Introverts may also be mistakenly characterized as cold, aloof or scheming. Introverts are less emotionally expressive, often focusing on their feelings rather than expressing them. For example, if you’ve suffered a loss, they might become very quiet because they empathize deeply with your grief. But outwardly, this could look like aloofness.  And since extroverts are more likely to express their emotions, when someone doesn’t express their emotions, it makes them think one of two things: Either the introvert is insensitive – or he isn’t sharing his feelings with his coworkers because he dislikes them. This can lead an extrovert to believe that the introvert is either cold-hearted or has become estranged from the team – which can have dire consequences in an office environment. If you notice one of your colleagues takes their time to speak, don’t judge them too soon: they might just be introverted. Do you hesitate before you share your thoughts? Do you pause to check the pros and cons of your statement? If so, you may well be introverted. And whilst some might misunderstand why you’re taking your time to react, it can also be a big advantage. Why? Because not blurting out your thoughts prevents you from making a costly faux pas. And in some professional fields, one wrong word can cost your job – for instance if you’re a press spokesman, a politician or a diplomat. For example, think of a diplomat impulsively blurting out some comment about a first lady's funny hat! Another advantage to thinking before speaking is that when everything you say is well-founded, your statements will gain extra consideration. By thoroughly processing your thoughts before you share them, you’ll greatly improve the quality of your statements – and people will notice. Imagine a panel discussion where you provide all the relevant data, present your position in a conclusive way, and anticipate counter-arguments. In consequence, you’ll appear more competent and worth listening to compared to a co-panelist who hogged the mic to share nothing of substance. Furthermore, if people know you don’t speak out impulsively, you’re more likely to get access to helpful privileged information. When people know you can hold your tongue, they expect their secrets to be safe with you – which means they might entrust you with helpful, privileged information. For example, your boss might confide in you that he secretly applied for a job in another company. If you wanted to become your boss’s successor, this knowledge would allow you to start distinguishing yourself from the crowd. In the following blinks you’ll learn how introverts can improve their leadership skills. To further our exploration of introverts, let’s consider the case of Judy, a quiet four-year-old. Judy rarely plays with her peers, but is a brilliant observer and knows the exact activities and playmates each of her peers prefers. In fact most introverts like Judy are good observers. This is because introverts often don’t participate in games, banter, chit-chat or discussions, but rather stay at the fringes and intently observe the interactions. For example, Judy might be reluctant to play tag – but while her peers are focusing on trying to escape, she’ll spend her time closely observing the action, learning who always giggles nervously before being caught and which children cooperate to divert the chaser. This tendency to pay close attention also makes many introverts great listeners: when they listen to you, introverts really focus on the ideas you’re sharing. They’re also less distracted than extroverts, because they aren’t thinking up witty replies. These tendencies lead many introverts to become well practiced listeners: if you had a pair of fraternal twins, one of them a talkative extrovert, the other an introverted listener, by the age of eight, the introvert will have much more listening practice than his brother. But why are these skills important?  Because these observational and listening skills are crucial to being a great leader. Through attentive listening and observing, a leader gains useful information about her team’s needs. For example, she’ll know the specific motivation that can help a team member overcome a dry spell and improve overall performance. Also, good listening skills help build rapport with customers and superiors, because people feel respected and valued when you listen to them attentively. Meeting the right people and nurturing relationships are essential for a leader’s success. But does this mean that introverts have to exhaust themselves spending their workdays in team meetings and their evenings collecting business cards? The tension between introverts and traditional networking arises because extroverts and introverts prefer different types of interaction: extroverts enjoy small talk, whilst introverts prefer in-depth conversation. For introverts, networking often consists of too much small talk which they can’t connect to. But there are other ways of networking for introverts – like networking websites. This is great for introverts because many of them prefer to communicate through writing, which they can do in the relative quiet of their cubicle. Also, many introverts are already proficient writers, and are adept at making good first impressions via email or messaging. Finally, on a website introverts have the opportunity to think through and revise everything they want to contribute as they desire. Another great way for introverts to network is to focus on one-on-one conversation. This allows them to get to know the other person in depth, and increase rapport by adapting to each person’s need. For example, they can find out about the way the other person thinks – like if they prefer abstract concepts or a hands-on approach. In a focused one-on-one conversation, people are also more likely to open up and share intimate details which are useful to leaders. Finally, introverts can connect with people who would keep silent in a team meeting – maybe other introverts – as they’ll appear much more present and approachable than in a meeting. Imagine: maybe in a hundred years there will be no more offices, everyone will work from home and every social interaction will take place on the internet: this could be the era of the introverts. But until then, introverted leaders will have to push their comfort zones to adapt to our extroverted world. Why? Because if introverts stay in their comfort zone, they’ll avoid many kinds of interaction. For example, their dislike of the limelight will make them avoid public speaking. Or they might steer around unofficial get-togethers with their colleagues in an attempt to stock up on solitary time, and avoid the small talk typical of informal gatherings. Finally, they might email urgent messages instead of calling their co-workers on the phone, because many introverts prefer writing to talking. But embracing these kinds of interaction and overcoming fear and discomfort is crucial for an introverted leader’s career. As a leader, an introvert must educate her team, represent her company and publicly present her ideas – all tasks which will involve public speaking at some point. And unofficial get-togethers actually provide introverts with great opportunities to form professionally helpful alliances, learn more about their team and create rapport. Finally, emailing is an ineffective way of communicating important news, because mails take time to be opened – or can be missed altogether.  Some people struggle so much with small talk they come to believe they’re simply lacking the small talk gene. But they're mistaken – because in fact, everyone can learn small talk. Small-talking is a particular challenge for introverts, and their tendency to shun it can make them appear rude, unfriendly or incompetent – which can seriously harm their careers. But if introverts prepare for small-talk in advance, they can become confident enough to stop avoiding it. They could for example prepare backup topics, entertaining anecdotes and generic open-ended questions they can employ when needed.  Preparation can also help introverts speed up their response time – and avoid being intellectually underestimated. As we saw, introverts take their time to work out a well-founded answer. But if an introvert anticipates and thinks about some likely questions before a meeting, she can respond quickly when the time comes.   Introverts benefit not only from preparation, but also from regularly practicing small talk and public speaking – two crucial aspects of being a good leader. Like preparation, practice can address any of the challenges of being an introverted leader. Maybe you lack practice at public speaking because you shun the limelight, or avoid small talk because you like deep conversations. But if you practice things you wouldn’t do naturally, like making small-talk, you’ll gradually get used to them. It’s like a right-handed person practicing painting with their left hand: eventually, it’ll stop feeling awkward. Practice also helps you add tools to your communication skill set – like the ability to easily raise your voice or dramatically whisper during a public speech to emphasize your key point. This is especially important when preparation is not an option, like when a position requires giving great ad lib presentations. The key message in this book: Being an introvert can make taking on leadership positions challenging, but there are ways of overcoming the obstacles. Your listening and observational skills and your tendency to carefully choose your words can give you an advantage over extroverted leaders and support your success.

Well, such leadership moments can teach us something important about how to act as leaders. By analyzing the experiences of other leaders in these moments and asking yourself what lessons they teach, you can better anticipate what to do when faced with similar challenges. In these blinks, we look at nine situations in which one leader was faced with a difficult challenge. The stories are about business leaders, astronauts, leaders of NGOs, civil war generals and mountain climbers, and they all give us insight into how to tackle decision-making in this fluctuating world – insight we can use when facing our own leadership moments. In these blinks, you’ll learn how a lack of action almost was the end of financial traders Salomon Inc; That a lack of communication can be literally fatal; and what an astronaut can teach us about quick and precise decision-making. Are you always on the lookout for new challenges? That’s a good thing. Taking on new responsibilities is usually stressful, and sometimes nightmarish! But it’s a surefire way to gain new skills and experience, which, in turn, prepares you for even more challenges. For Clifton Wharton, the former US Deputy Secretary of State, challenging assignments were an opportunity to sharpen his skills and enrich his practical knowledge. A development economist, Wharton faced his first landmark challenge when he was elected president of Michigan State University. In the eight years Wharton spent there, he successfully led and administered the university in spite of its huge campus and vastly complicated systems. When invited to head the State University of New York, Wharton accepted. The State University of New York had an administration about ten times larger than that of Michigan State, and control was very centralized. But through his experiences at Michigan State and as a board member of large corporations, including Ford Motor Co., Wharton knew that even the largest, most resistant enterprises could be restructured. Again, Wharton was able to leverage lessons learned in previous challenges to solve another and eventually reshaped and improved New York State. These experiences prepared Wharton for yet another huge challenge as he accepted a job offer from the Teachers Insurance and Annuities Association-College Retirement Equities Fund (TIAA-CREF), the biggest non-government retirement provider for college and university professors. With products ranging from retirement planning to life insurance, the TIAA-CREF had a lot on its plate. Clients of the TIAA-CREF were losing patience with their restricted investment options and lack of control over their own retirement funds. When the organization offered Wharton a position, they were in dire need of a solution for their inflexible structure. In 1987, Wharton took office and began modernizing the state system. He created three top management teams to steer the enterprise while introducing greater autonomy and accountability in customer service. Clients were given access to diverse investment options, greater flexibility in transferring their funds and improved counseling services. You, too, can immerse yourself in your current role and all the learning opportunities it offers. These will give you the tools to succeed in positions of greater responsibility later on. When on the hunt for a new job, which positions catch your eye? Probably those offered by companies that have goals similar to your own. Sharing a vision for the future with the organization you work for is also a prerequisite for great leadership, as is a deep understanding of your own values. This is something which Nancy Barry’s career reflects. As a senior official at the World Bank, Barry was beginning to doubt whether their aid projects for developing countries actually did that much good. So she envisioned an alternative: alleviating poverty and hardship through microfinancing, providing financial and educational services to low-income groups to help them provide for themselves. The World Bank didn’t share this goal, but Women’s World Banking (WWB) did, which is why Barry accepted their job offer. The WWB offered women in developing countries the financial tools and resources to become self-sufficient, and needed Barry’s expertise as much as she needed their platform to realize her vision. During her time at the World Bank, Barry had developed a network with leading financiers, which helped her create valuable relationships with established institutions for the WWB. Barry’s leadership experience drove the decentralization and expansion of the WWB, which in turn successfully helped microfinance reach millions of women in need. Like Barry, Roy Vagelos was also driven by a clear vision – to cure river blindness, a waterborne parasitic infection found in Africa. Vagelos developed the drug Mectizan, a scientific breakthrough that both helped cure river blindness and prevent the spread of the disease. The cost of manufacturing Mectizan was high, but this didn’t stop Vagelos. He stuck to his company’s values which were to “put patients before profits.” Some leaders find themselves in life-and-death situations, where a failure to make the right choice fast can have devastating consequences. Eugene Kranz was one such leader. His brilliant leadership as the flight director of the Apollo 13 lunar mission shows that a decision made quickly needn’t be a decision made poorly. In 1970, the spacecraft Odyssey, in flight, suffered an explosion. This was nothing short of a catastrophe – air pressure, electricity and fuel cells were being lost at an alarming rate. The astronauts had to return to Earth as soon as possible. The situation called for rapid action; the team had mere minutes to dash from the command module to the lunar excursion module following the explosion. In the mad rush, it was Kranz’s job to uncover the facts of the situation and make the right calls. Any errors on his part would have been disastrous; a single blunder could have sent the spacecraft hurtling along the wrong path, never to return to Earth. And there was no time to waste, either. But by remaining composed and concentrated, Kranz gathered enough information to make the right decision at every step, successfully getting his team home. Unlike Kranz, John Gutfreund’s leadership career was marked by his failure to act in an urgent situation. In 1991, Gutfreund, chairman and CEO of investment bank Salomon Inc. became aware of their bond trader Paul Mozer’s excessive bidding. While the US Treasury did not accept bids exceeding 35 percent of an auction total for a government bond, Mozer was bidding under different names on multiple occasions in order to exceed the legal percentage. How did Gutfreund respond? Well, he didn’t. Mozer was allowed to remain in the company, and his conduct was not investigated nor reported to authorities until three months later. This delay not only caused public outcry, but nearly proved fatal for the company. Salomon Inc. was forced to pay a massive $290 million settlement to federal regulators. With their reputation tarnished permanently, their stock went into free fall. No companies were willing to work with Salomon after the scandal. This was a nightmare for Gutfreund, one that could have been avoided had he simply acted immediately. Of course, acting fast means having a fast team. In the next blink, we’ll investigate how leaders mobilize their teams. Back in 1994, Wagner Dodge was the chief of a 15-man crew of firefighters, working together for the very first time. One day, they were called to Mann Gulch, a rugged area of central Montana; a forest fire was burning. Dodge had vast experience dealing with forest fires. But it was a different story when it came to leading a crew. A man of few words, Dodge rarely offered appraisals of the situation at hand, nor was he particularly adept at expressing and explaining his decisions. Unfortunately, Dodge’s poor communication skills had fatal consequences at the Mann Gulch fire. Just as Dodge and his crew arrived and were heading for the mouth of the gorge between the fire and the river, Dodge retreated to the landing zone without explanation. He had simply gone to collect some forgotten food, but the team had no idea why he’d suddenly left. Dodge returned and they continued on, until they discovered that a new fire was quickly closing off their escape route. Dodge reversed his course and ordered his men to drop their equipment. He was alarmed about the growing fire and wanted his men to be able to get away from it as fast as possible. But, once again, Dodge failed to explain this to the crew. The forest fire began to outrun them, and Dodge stopped to light a backfire to prevent the real fire from advancing. He took shelter behind it, and urged his crew to do the same. At this point, however, they weren’t going to listen to Dodge anymore. His lack of communication meant that they doubted his ability and decided to go their own way. At the moment when Dodge needed them to trust him, they abandoned him. Tragically, all 14 crew members lost their lives as a result. Here, the importance of explaining your decisions when leading your team hardly needs further emphasis. It was in 1863 that Colonel Joshua Chamberlain, who commanded the 20th Regiment of Infantry, Maine Volunteers, during the American Civil War, defended and secured Little Round Top, a crucial strategic point in Gettysburg. This would not have been possible without his top-performing army. Given that a third of Chamberlain’s army were mutineers recently decommissioned from the 2nd Regiment of Maine, you wouldn’t think he’d have a very cohesive force on his hands. And yet, Chamberlain was able to win full cooperation of these mutineers by giving them what they needed: someone to voice their grievances to. He listened to their stories and showed his understanding. When he asked for their support in his upcoming clash with the Confederates, none of them hesitated. His compassion, as well as his powerful words about the Union’s determination to set all people free, no matter their background, led the mutineers to follow him into battle to defeat the Confederates – one of many moments in history where gaining support has proved to be the deciding factor between victory and defeat. Another way you can secure the support of your team is by reaching consensus with them before carrying out a decision. Arlene Blum knew this as she led a team of all-female mountaineers on a climb of Annapurna, in Nepal. The extreme conditions at the summit meant that only one attempt to reach it might be possible. As they neared the peak, Blum consulted her team. It was clear to her that they simply couldn’t all head up to the summit at once. They agreed together that safety should come first, and supported Blum’s plan to have just four people in one group make the first attempt. Two women were accompanied by two local guides; they all reached the summit successfully. Though this meant that the rest of the team didn’t get the chance to see the peak, it didn’t matter. Because they had reached a consensus beforehand, the team was happy to support those who did make the journey to the top. At the end of the day, powerful team feeling is the greatest accomplishment, and your supporters will cherish it. The key message in this book: The stories of leaders contain powerful lessons about the importance of learning, vision, decision-making, communication and compassion. Leadership comprised of these factors will enable you to guide your team to a performance that will make everyone proud! Actionable advice: Think about what type of leader you are. There are many different leadership styles, though not all of them make for effective leadership in every situation. From autocratic leadership, where decisions are made fast without consultation, to democratic leadership, where opinion matters, to laissez-faire leadership, where team members themselves take the lead, it helps to know what leadership approaches are available to you. Before choosing yours, think about which one will work best in a given situation. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

The conventional way can be crudely described as a top-down hierarchy, where the main purpose is to maximize profits. But in the new economy, this traditional rigidity is not enough; today, we need a new type of management: radical management. Radical management focuses on customer delight and innovation. It’s based on seven principles that will get your team to focus on your customers. This is a step-by-step guide on how to apply these principles, abandon the ossified approach of traditional management and adopt radical management instead. You will also find out why your Net Promoter Score is crucial; how self-organizing teams drive diversity and innovation; and why leading transparently is key to radical management. If you want to practice radical management, you need to start by asking an important question: “What am I trying to accomplish?” The answer to that question, and the guiding principle for your business, should be client delight. If you can keep your clients delighted, you’re bound to have a successful business, with loyal customers who’ll provide you with steady profits. This money can then be used to fund innovations for maintaining that delight. And you should not only inspire delight in your clients; it should be used to motivate and inspire your employees as well. Instead of just working for a paycheck, employees should recognize the value in helping others and putting a smile on a customer’s face. Client delight doesn’t just make a customer’s day better. It also makes the lives of employees happier and more fulfilled. To measure client delight, you can reach out to customers directly with surveys or questionnaires that seek to determine their willingness to recommend your service to others. Many businesses, including the Boston-based consultancy firm Bain & Company, have found that a willingness to recommend is one of the best indicators of client delight. Fred Reichheld is a manager at Bain & Company, and his surveys use what’s called a Net Promoter Score (NPS). This tool works by asking customers to use a scale of zero to ten to rate the likelihood of their recommending your product or service to other people. A very high score like nine or ten indicates the client will act as a promoter of your business, while a low score of zero to six suggests they’ll be a detractor – someone who will speak negatively about your business to others. By using regular NPS surveys you can be sure you’re as effective as possible by targeting your detractors and putting your efforts into turning them into promoters. But facilitating this metamorphosis requires that you know how to delight your clients, which is what we’ll explore in the blinks ahead. So how can you make sure your customers are delighted? Well, unfortunately, there isn’t one simple answer to this question. But there are steps you can take to ensure you’re doing everything you can. This brings us to the second principle of radical management: use self-organizing teams. Delighting your clients is a perfect example of a complex problem. Solving such a problem requires the right kind of team – a collection of diverse individuals that can organize and be responsible for their work. Diversity means an eclectic mix of team members. You want people with expertise in varying fields, people who won’t all approach the problem the same way. A self-organizing team will have no controlling leader. Everyone should be equally responsible for coming up with the solutions for the complex problem or challenge at hand. In a sense, a self-organizing team is sort of like a jury. Good juries are designed to represent the full spectrum of a community, with different ages, cultures, religions and classes all present. These different people are asked to put their heads together and come up with an answer to a complex problem. Diverse groups work better than like-minded ones because when everyone has similar expertise and a similar background, they tend to get stuck and unable to move forward. When a certain problem stumps one person in a homogenous group, it’ll likely stump everyone else. But the more diverse a group is, the better the chance that someone will know the answer to any question that may arise. This was the essential idea behind the 2007 book The Difference, written by University of Michigan professor Scott E. Page, who specializes in complex systems. Page gives plenty of examples illustrating that a diverse, self-organizing team is better at solving complex problems than any group of like-minded experts. No one wants to sell a product that customers have no interest in buying. But, nevertheless, there’s no shortage of businesses that continue to get stuck with massive and costly inventories of unsold products. This is what the third principle of radical management seeks to avoid by using client-driven iterations. When your business is focused on client-driven iterations, it only produces things that customers want, when they want it. And with the use of customer feedback and a trial-and-error approach, you can continuously improve your product or service through multiple iterations to make sure you’re meeting the client’s needs. This process ensures your clients will be delighted, and you won’t be stuck with warehouses full of useless products. The company Quadrant Homes attained success by becoming more client-driven. In the 1990s, Quadrant was buying up pieces of land on which to immediately build pre-designed houses. The company simply used their best guess to determine what customers might want from these houses, and unsurprisingly, was left with far too many unsold houses. Clearly, something had to change. By working through iterations, Quadrant began focusing on what clients actually wanted and selling houses before building them. Clients can now choose their location and lot, and then select from a variety of combinations to customize everything from floor plan to exterior. Quadrant can then make the appropriate adjustments and get to work. This process has made Quadrant an efficient and successful business. By letting the client decide both what and when it should produce, costs have plummeted and client delight has soared. But this process doesn’t delight clients only; it also affords employees more enjoyment at work. In many businesses, employees are removed from the results and unable to see how their everyday work directly contributes to customer satisfaction. But client-driven iterations allow employees to maintain a relationship with customers from beginning to end. They actually get to see the link between their work and the satisfied clients, making their job significantly more rewarding. If you have a daily commute and drive to work every day, you know how frustrating it can be when too many cars come together at once and create a traffic jam. But the same thing can happen at work. When you take on too many projects and responsibilities, you can end up stuck, and, as a result, both your productivity and your clients can begin to suffer. This is exactly what began happening to cancer patients at a certain medical center offering chemotherapy. Every day, patients would show up bright and early to get a blood test and speak with an oncologist who would check their condition and make sure they were fit for treatment. Once everything was in order, the oncologist would send the patient to the part of the facility where the chemo takes place. Since chemotherapy can be quite an ordeal for patients, most oncologists would schedule the treatment as soon as possible so that patients could get on with their day. All of this was done with the best of intentions, but, in reality, it didn’t work out so well. Patients often ended up in line, waiting for hours for their treatment. Employees also struggled with this system, since it forced them to run around frenziedly as they tried to tend to every patient at once. A better system, and one that doesn’t overflow and jam up the works, is one that follows the fourth principle of radical management: deliver value to your clients in every iteration. A great way to do this is to analyze every step in the process to find ways of creating value, whether it’s reducing wait times, improving customer service or making it easier for people to conduct a transaction. At the medical center, when they analyzed the problem, it became clear they were trying to do too much in the morning and that the afternoons were relatively quiet. So oncologists began to spread out the appointments more evenly throughout the day, reducing both the waiting time and the stress that employees had to cope with. This both saved the medical center money and obviated the need to hire extra help to deal with the morning rush. You may have noticed that traditional management sometimes refuses to acknowledge a problem when it exists. And this lack of honesty and openness often puts it at odds with problem-solving. Managers deny problems to maintain power and keep up the appearance that they’re in complete control. But it also means that employees are less likely to report real problems when they arise. In an environment of avoidance, a business is unlikely to solve a complex problem, such as the problem of ensuring that clients are delighted. To tackle this challenge, everyone needs to feel free to openly and honestly discuss what is really happening. And this includes pointing out problems and figuring out how to solve them. This is why the fifth principle of radical management is transparency. To really see how damaging a lack of transparency can be, let’s examine Robert McNamara’s time as president of the World Bank, from 1968 to 1981. During this time, McNamara expanded the World Bank’s role in developing agriculture and helping alleviate poverty. This meant drastically increasing the amount of lending that was going on, which had many people worried that McNamara was financing low-quality deals that would not really help the lender countries. To these accusations, McNamara said, “Absolutely not!” In his opinion, only a fool would deny that the World Bank simply had to expand on lending. Of course, later analysis would show that the loans were troublesome and put many developing countries into a damaging state of debt. But his refusal to acknowledge the issue made it impossible for staff to fix the problem. Not only did McNamara’s brand of management obscure the truth; his denial of the problem made it unlikely that anyone in his staff would try to fix what was wrong. This is the situation that radical transparency seeks to avoid. By being honest and clear, problems can be identified and dealt with the moment they appear. What would you do if you noticed a coworker was scamming company clients? Are you the kind of person who would stay quiet and not create an incident, or would you report it? For a successful business, it’s important for management to create an environment where employees feel safe and comfortable enough to report a problem. In such an environment, it’s harder for minor issues to grow into massive problems, and it’s easier for employees to constantly be on the lookout for ways to improve. Often, a problem in one area can affect everyone. And this is why Japanese engineer Taiichi Ohno invented a problem-prevention system for the Toyota car company in 1955. Ohno installed pullcords – called andon cords – near factory workers along the production line so that if anyone saw a problem they could pull the cord, ceasing production so that everyone could focus on solving the issue. It’s also important to recognize problems as opportunities to make improvements, which leads us to the sixth principle of radical management: continuous self-improvement. To keep self-improvement in mind, you should focus on two things: the goal – to always be improving – and the means to reach that goal, which is a dedicated workforce. Within this workforce, employees should be encouraged to report any problems they find, at the moment they’re found. They should also feel empowered to come up with solutions. This transparent and empowered system is proven to bring down costs, inspire innovation and, ultimately, bring about more client delight. At Toyota, they’ve been working with a system of self-improvement for decades now, and it’s been key to delighting clients worldwide. It’s part of their ability to keep their prices low, their quality high and their problems at an absolute minimum. If you’re a manager, it’s likely you’ve felt overwhelmed at one point or another. And who can blame you! After all, managers are expected to juggle three big responsibilities all at once. First, managers need to make sure everyone's getting adequately compensated for their work. Second, they need to accept their position of authority and answer the inevitable questions their employees will have. And third, managers need to do all of this while keeping people happy and motivated. This brings us to the seventh and final principle of radical management: interactive communication. To juggle these responsibilities, managers should be good communicators who are socially comfortable and know how to react to a variety of situations. If a manager is only concerned with making sure that employees are adequately compensated, the staff is bound to feel like they're nothing more than hired help. Likewise, if a manager is only concerned with being authoritative, the employees will feel that they’re being bossed around by a dictator. So, to motivate employees and make sure they’re putting in the kind of engaged and productive work that will lead to client delight, a radical manager needs to know how to be socially mindful and give employees the attention they need. Truly interactive communication is about being respectful, genuine and keeping a two-way path of communication open between you and your staff. This will help you to keep a healthy balance of authority and motivation going, as well as get you through those tough salary negotiations successfully. Now that you know the keys to radical management, it’s time to put them into action! Before long, you’ll start seeing your customer satisfaction numbers going up, and your business will reap the rewards. The key message in this book: There is another way to organize your business than along the traditional, outdated lines most companies use. With seven principles: delighting clients, self-organizing teams, client-driven iterations, delivering value to clients in each iteration, radical transparency, continuous self-improvement, and interactive communication you can create an organization that keeps innovating and delighting both employees and clients. Actionable advice: Make sure your teams work with purpose. When setting up self-organizing teams, make sure they work for a purpose. Often, teams don’t feel very motivated if they merely work toward a bureaucratic goal, like increasing productivity. Instead, you should share with them a gripping purpose, like making a difference in your clients’ lives. This will make the work far more engaging for them. Got feedback?

Hagemann","summary":"Every year, there’s a new crop of books on leadership, and the truth is that most of them just come up with a new set of buzzwords to dress up the same old advice. But within the realm of neuropsychology, there’s a wealth of leadership insights to be found that are waiting to be put to use. How we think, feel and behave are all products of distinct psychological processes that neuroscience helps bring to light. These blinks will show you how knowledge of these functions can be used to guide decisions and strategies in both your workplace and your private life. Along with this hard science, you’ll find the tools to build good habits and understand personality profiles, all of which will help you maximize your performance. In these blinks, you’ll discover how the right amount of stress can be useful; why sleep is underrated; and what a perfect team looks like. If you’ve ever played tennis or baseball, you’re probably familiar with the sweet spot. This is an area on a bat or tennis racquet that will give you the best control or most power when hitting the ball. But what you may not know is that there’s also a sweet spot for getting the most out of your job performance. We all have a mental zone that allows us to do our best and most productive work, and research shows that it takes just the right amount of applied stress to get us there. The link between stress and performance was discovered in 1908 by psychologists Robert Yerkes and John Dodson, who found that rats were better at navigating mazes when given mild electric shocks. However, they found that when the shocks were too intense, the rats would panic and try to escape. So there was a sweet spot, where just the right amount of added stress would help produce peak performance. The same holds true for humans as well: when the stress levels are at just the right intensity, we’ll reach our optimal levels of attention and focus. Too low, and we’re likely to be unfocused and bored; too high, and we’ll be so panicked that we won’t be able to focus on the task at hand. So what is the perfect amount of stress? Results show that men, on average, require more applied stress than women to reach that sweet spot of peak performance. Researchers believe this is due to their higher levels of testosterone, which is associated with risk-taking and thrill-seeking behavior. So, to perform at their best, those with high testosterone levels will require a more thrilling, or stressful, scenario. Since our testosterone levels decrease with age, research shows that the level of stress required for the best work results also decreases over time. Football fans know Zinedine Zidane as one of the greatest football players ever – but many also remember him for one moment during the 2006 World Cup final, when he headbutted an Italian player. The collective reaction of spectators everywhere was along the lines of, “What was he thinking?!” But the truth was, Zidane likely wasn’t thinking at all. When emotional outbursts like Zidane’s occur, the conscious, civilized part of our brain, known as the prefrontal cortex, is temporarily hijacked by the limbic system, a more powerful and primitive region. This limbic system is what kept our ancestors safe by giving them quick, often unconscious, reflexes when their lives were in danger. Conscious, rational decisions reduce our reaction time, and when it’s a matter of spotting a saber-toothed tiger in the corner of your eye, it’s imperative that we act first and think later. Our primitive limbic system still takes over when danger is perceived, but what gets recognized as a threat these days perhaps isn’t always a life-or-death matter. Instead of a fearsome predator, it’s more likely to be an annoying coworker that triggers the survival responses of a pounding heart and a temporary lapse in rational judgment. As you can imagine, this can have potentially devastating career consequences. However, there is a way to outsmart the primitive, unthinking part of your brain by regulating your emotions – and a key factor for this to happen is to make sure you get enough sleep. The director of the Sleep and Neuroimaging Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley, Matthew Walker, has found that without adequate sleep, our brain is more likely to revert to primitive behavioral patterns that lack appropriate, controlled responses. In Walker’s studies, a sleep-deprived person was 60 percent more likely to be controlled by his emotions and be susceptible to such outbursts. So don’t risk it and make sure you get proper shut-eye. The commonalities between Barack Obama and Jennifer Aniston may not be readily apparent, but like many others, they’ve both found it difficult to quit smoking. Regardless of your strengths in other aspects of life, habits can get the better of us no matter who we are. Psychologists at the University of Southern California believe that habits account for around 45 percent of our day-to-day lives. The reason our minds find habits so appealing is that they don’t take any brain power. Without any need for reasoning or finding motivation, habits let the mind shift into autopilot mode. This doesn’t mean the brain is being lazy; since you don’t have to consciously think about your habits, you can actually do more without having your brain be overloaded by it all. Now, not all habits need to be bad, like smoking. You can use good habits to your advantage, though it does take time and brainpower to form a new habit since any new activity requires conscious thought. But after a while, as the mind continually returns and develops the habit, it will require less and less energy. This process of establishing a new habit becomes easy once you know how to work with, rather than against, the formidable unconscious part of your brain. Habits often rely on cues, so a helpful tip to creating a new habit is to associate it with something you already do every day. For example, to make a habit of brushing your teeth in the morning, you can cue this activity to happen after breakfast, the moment after you rinse out your coffee cup. Or, if your goal is to be better prepared for filing your taxes, you can link the habit of filing your receipts to occur in the morning while you’re waiting for your computer to boot up. After doing this a few times, it’ll eventually become automatic. Something’s not right. This was the feeling a lieutenant fireman had one day as he led his team in putting out a kitchen fire. As they were struggling to put out the flames in the kitchen, he was noticing that the living room was far hotter than it should be. He quickly ordered his team to evacuate, and just seconds after they did, the floor of the living room collapsed into a pit of flames. This is another example of the power of the unconscious mind. The fireman didn’t think there was something wrong, he felt it. His unconscious mind was trying to tell him something, otherwise known as an intuition, and he acted upon it. It shows us that, sometimes, thinking less is the smartest thing you can do. The conscious part of the brain, also called the working memory, is sometimes clever, but it also lacks the capacity to juggle a lot of information all at once. In fact, it generally has room for about four pieces of information at any given time. The unconscious part of the brain, on the other hand, is much more powerful, with space for a virtually unlimited amount of information. So, for tasks that require complex appraisal, such as determining how sturdy every part of an unfamiliar burning building is, it can be best to leave it to intuition. But despite the speed and reliability of our intuition, many people and businesses still refuse to trust it. This isn’t a new development. Around 250 years ago, during the Enlightenment in Europe, a new culture was born that put reason and rationality above all else. A lot of good came of this, including democracy and scientific progress, but the value given to intuition was greatly reduced and the idea of “going with your gut” was only a last resort. Since then, intuition has been trying to improve its reputation. In 1961, comic books were forever changed when the writer Stan Lee unveiled one of his greatest creations, the Fantastic Four. Each member of the team has their own unique superpower: invisibility, super strength, the ability to create and control fire and the power to stretch like taffy. The Fantastic Four are definitely the stuff of wild fantasy – but they can also teach us something about how the best teams in business operate. Just like the members of the Fantastic Four, the greatest teams in real life are made up of people with special skills and personalities that perfectly complement one another. Now, let’s take a look at those personalities. The biological anthropologist, Dr. Helen Fisher, has analyzed neuroscientific data and come up with four key personality types. First is the Explorer. These are the ones who need more stress than others to reach their peak performance, making them ideal for taking risks. An Explorer is primarily influenced by dopamine, the biochemical related to the brain’s reward system for high-risk behavior. Then there’s the Builder. This type is steady and dependable, thanks to their use of cautious deliberation. Their primary influence is serotonin, the biochemical emitted to reward low-risk behavior. The third type is the Negotiator. This teammate has excess empathy, great verbal skills and a knack for always knowing what others are thinking and feeling. Their primary influence is the hormone estrogen. Finally, there’s the Director. With a fierce competitive streak, Directors are also pragmatic and decisive, while being primarily influenced by testosterone. The ideal high-performance team will have each of these personalities represented, along with the skills they bring to the table. However, as you’re assembling and managing this diverse dream team, keep these things in mind: Explorers are easily bored, especially when burdened with repetitive tasks. So make sure they’re assigned creative and engaging jobs. Negotiators are highly sensitive to recognition. So, if you don’t want a disgruntled teammate, make sure they know how much they’re trusted and appreciated. Directors benefit from working within a strong hierarchy; otherwise, don’t be surprised if conflicts and competition arise over who’s really in charge. Builders are highly organized and don’t appreciate surprise changes in their schedule or assignments. If possible, let Builders set their own schedule. There’s a saying you probably heard as a child that goes, “Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me.” It’s a nice thought, but scientists now know what a lot of kids are well aware of: words can and do hurt. When someone attacks with sticks or words, the same areas in the brain are activated, which shows that physical pain and social pain have a lot in common. Some of our most painful experiences in life will include the death of loved ones or rejection by a group or individual we admire, and in both of these cases, the brain will react in a nearly identical way. This is what the results of research on social pain have revealed. One study involved participants being asked to play a computerized version of catch with two other players they believed were human but were actually computer simulations. Eventually, the participant was excluded from the game by the other players, and it led to a neural reaction that was extremely similar to how the brain responds to physical pain. Managers would do well to recognize this and not ignore incidents where an employee is dealing with social pain, even if there isn’t a noticeable drop in the quality of work. You wouldn’t expect someone with a physical injury to be at peak performance, so the same holds true for someone who’s dealing with a breakup or some other painful circumstance. Specifically, in response to social pain, the brain will experience a reduced capacity for making plans, concentration and creativity; in other words, it will be far from peak performance. So, to lessen the risk of team members feeling socially rejected and suffering the related pain, managers need to keep a constant eye on team dynamics and track how well everyone is cooperating and getting along. Managers should also take the time to form their own strong social bonds with each of their teammates. This way, they can routinely check in, ask staff about their lives and let them know they’re respected and appreciated. The key message in this book: Don’t let buzzwords or slogans dictate your leadership practices. Instead, use science and neuropsychology to give yourself a real advantage. How we think, feel and behave is the result of distinct psychological processes that can only be truly understood with neuroscience. Leaders should thus look to this field for answers and strategies, instead of always just implementing the latest management fad. Actionable advice: Avoid multitasking and change your location from time to time. Some people love to boast about their multitasking talents, but the truth is that multitasking reduces productivity and makes you slower, not faster. Studies show that multitasking not only increases errors and levels of stress but also results in mental fatigue. So, work on individual activities in one spot until they’re complete. Then, take your laptop to a new location and get started on your next activity there. This subtle change to your work environment will help refresh your mind by giving it a strong signal that you’re working on something new. Got feedback?

Turning strangers into friends is a process that is as natural to us, as humans, as are breathing and walking. Yet many of us seem to lack the skills to make friends effectively. Perhaps we’re too shy, or we don’t have the ability to empathize with others. If this is you, there is hope. Rather than resigning yourself to living a lonely life, read the advice in these blinks. You’ll discover the secret skills to getting people to like you, the same tricks and talents that the Federal Bureau of Investigation uses to snare spies and informants! In these blinks, you’ll discover why we only expose our arteries to someone we actually like; what eyebrows and fireflies have in common; and why long-term relationships have everything to do with LOVE. If you want someone to like you, what should you do? Advice from most people would probably be, “just be yourself!” Yet the author disagrees; there is more to being liked than just being genuine. There is a friendship “formula.” The first steps are to frequently be in proximity with the person you want to like you. People who share the same physical surroundings are more likely to be drawn to one another. So try to be around the person you want to win over as often as you are able. Let’s look at a scenario. FBI agent Charles needed to befriend a foreign diplomat, codename Seagull, to convince Seagull to become a spy for the United States. Using the technique of proximity, he started following Seagull’s daily route to the grocery store, so that they both would share the same environment for a time each day. In doing so, Charles worked to increase the number of times when Seagull would become aware of him, so he’d start to seem familiar. Other steps in the formula are the duration and intensity of time spent with your target. Duration is important. The more time you spend with someone, the more you’ll be able to influence them to like you. After a couple of months, Charles used the power of duration by actually following Seagull into the grocery store, which added to the contact time between them. He also enlisted intensity – meaning how well one is able to satisfy another person’s psychological and/or physical needs – by offering nonverbal “friend signals.” By nodding his head and catching Seagull’s eye on occasion, Seagull naturally became interested in whom Charles was and why he was always around. By the time Charles introduced himself as a FBI agent, Seagull was already primed to become a friend. And because of this familiarity, Seagull agreed to be a spy. While humans don’t exactly have a lot in common with fireflies, we do share one particular behavior trait. Fireflies flash their light-emitting organs as a signal to attract partners for mating. Similarly, humans use an eyebrow “flash” to attract positive attention. This nonverbal cue is a rapid up-and-down movement of the eyebrows, lasting for around one-sixth of a second. Even from quite far away, an eyebrow flash sends a signal that you don’t pose a threat to the person you’re approaching. A second primary nonverbal cue is the head tilt. This is a nonthreatening gesture, since tilting your head to the left or the right exposes one of your carotid arteries, which provides oxygenated blood to the brain. We unconsciously expose these arteries only to people who are harmless. Conversely, we tuck our neck into our shoulders to protect ourselves when we feel threatened. It has been shown that people who tilt their heads toward the person they are talking with are perceived as more friendly, kind and honest when compared to individuals who keep their heads upright. A third powerful nonverbal signal is a genuine smile. We judge those with smiling faces to be more likeable, attractive and less dominant, as well as friendly. As an added bonus, a smile releases endorphins, giving us a sense of well-being. It’s also difficult not to smile back at a person who is smiling at you; a reciprocated smile makes your target feel good. Making people feel good about themselves is critical to befriending them, as we’ll see in the next blink. So you’ve made your person of interest receptive to interacting with you, and now you’re ready to make verbal contact. How exactly should you go about this? The golden rule of friendship posits that if you want people to like you, you need to make them feel good about themselves. In fact, this is central to all successful relationships. As an FBI agent, this rule helped the author persuade people to become spies and confess to crimes! The rule even helped him get upgraded to business class on planes, several times. But how does the golden rule work? People tend to gravitate toward people who make them happy, because they want to give back the positive feeling that was offered to them. For example, when the author had a layover in Frankfurt before boarding an eight-hour flight with a middle seat in coach, he chose to spend his time chatting with the ticket agent. He spoke using so-called empathetic statements to keep the conversation revolving around the ticket agent, as opposed to himself. This way he showed that he was interested in the agent’s well-being and what the agent said. A standard empathetic statement could be, “So you are having a good/bad day?” By using this method, Schafer encouraged the agent to talk about himself and his day, and therefore generally feel good about himself. Consequently, as Schafer was about to board the plane, the agent replaced his coach boarding pass with a business class pass. This demonstrates how employing the golden rule of friendship inspires reciprocity. Even in one-time interactions, the tenet “If you make me happy, I want to make you happy” works wonders. So far we’ve seen the basic rules for making friends. Yet there are even more strategies you can add to your friendship toolbox. These are called the laws of attraction. One of these laws is the law of similarity, which recognizes that those people who share the same principles and beliefs tend to become friends. This law works because people who are similar tend to strengthen the similar aspects they share, which promotes mutual attraction. Similarity can be used by looking for things you have in common with the person with whom you want to have a good relationship. For instance, you might notice if your target’s clothes give away a potential shared interest, say if she is wearing a shirt with a particular sports team’s logo. If you find a commonality, gear the conversation toward that shared interest and avoid topics you don't both seem to be interested in. Another law is the law of curiosity, which states that when you show you are curious about a person, you automatically pique that person’s interest in you. Curiosity is a universal human trait, and one you can use by creating a “curiosity hook” to attract your person of interest. For instance, if you visit a café by yourself hoping to attract a new friend, order something unusual from the menu or bring an odd book with you to read. Standing out from others will mean there’s a good chance someone will ask you about your behavior. A third law is the law of reciprocity, which states that when someone gives you something, you are inclined to return the gesture in kind. You can exercise this law by doing someone a favor, such as buying them coffee or picking something up for them. When they say thank you, don’t default to, “You’re welcome,” but say instead, “I know you’d do the same thing for me.” This will evoke a sense of reciprocity. If you remember only one rule about making friends, let it be the rule of encouraging other people to speak. To do this effectively, remember the acronym LOVE: Listen, Observe, Vocalize and Empathize. First, you have to listen, and listen properly! You know the feeling of telling a story to someone who’s listening half-heartedly or constantly glancing at something else? Isn’t it annoying? Speakers usually know whether they’re being listened to or not, so pay attention when people speak by maintaining eye contact and never interrupting. Second, observe your partner’s nonverbal signals and body language while you’re interacting. Distancing actions, such as leaning back, crossing one’s arms over the chest or pressing the lips together are strong indicators that the conversation isn’t going so well. If you see this kind of behavior, you may be talking too much about yourself. So as soon as the other person starts to disengage, switch subjects to something that interests them more. Third, the way you vocalize and the content of what you say influences how you make and keep friends. Your tone of voice is pivotal to the message you want to convey. For instance, a low-pitched voice often denotes romantic interest, and a high-pitched voice may communicate surprise. And although it may seem obvious, what you say influences how others perceive you. Remember to verbally acknowledge others and give compliments to make people feel good about themselves and see you as a friend. Finally, use empathetic statements to let the other person know that you understand what’s happening around you both. You could show empathy, for instance, by using the phrase, “Wow, you’re busy. I don’t know how you do it!” to a waiter during a busy time at your local café. Rapport means having a relationship with someone based on mutual understanding. In essence, rapport is the thing that ensures the friendship you are developing is fulfilling for both parties. Testing for rapport lets you know how your relationship is progressing. Rapport establishes a psychological bridge between people, and determines the level of friendship that is being developed. If you want to build and maintain lasting relationships with people or want something specific  from a one-time encounter – like an upgrade – you need to test for rapport to determine when and if you’ve arrived at a point where you can push for your relationship objective. So how do you gauge rapport? Eye gaze is a tried and true way to test for rapport. If a person refuses to lock eyes with you, the relationship might need some more maintenance before advancing to the stage of prolonged eye contact. You can also look for behaviors, such as touching or mirroring, to test for rapport. While we typically only briefly touch each other below the shoulders or shake hands when we don’t know someone, touching that occurs outside this area signifies a closer relationship. A light touch on the forearm or knee when you are both seated will show whether rapport has been established or not. You can use mirroring, also called isopraxism, to test for rapport, since people who are psychologically connected will often mirror each other’s body language in conversation. To test this, try the “lead and follow” approach by changing your body position, like crossing or uncrossing your arms. If the other person mirrors you, rapport has usually been established. The key message in this book: There are a variety of nonverbal signals you can use to attract people before you even speak to them. Frequently staying within close proximity, making eye contact, tilting your head and smiling are just a few of the techniques you can use to endear yourself to others and eventually form and maintain solid relationships. Actionable advice: To maintain a thriving partnership, it’s essential that you CARE. When your relationship has grown into a friendship, it’s time to CARE. This entails compassion, such as offering kind words and a helping hand; active listening, or giving attention to what your friend is saying; offering reinforcement, like praise and acknowledgement when the friend does something well; and empathy, or understanding how your friend feels and actually caring about it.

Womack, Daniel T. Jones and Daniel Roos","summary":"“The car in front is a Toyota.” Do you remember this famous ad slogan from the 1990s? For decades Japanese car manufacturer Toyota has maintained its solid reputation for innovation and quality. The company’s cars sell well worldwide, being valued for both their efficiency and reliability.  A cornerstone of its successful global business is Toyota’s legendary production system, called TPS – more commonly known as lean production. In fact, this production method became so successful that it has since been adopted in other industries, such as design, programming and start-up management. These blinks give you the inside scoop on how lean production came to be and explain in detail how this system helped skyrocket Toyota to global success.  In these blinks, you’ll also learn why Toyota constantly (and purposefully) nearly runs out of stock; why every Toyota employee can stop a production line; and why many car companies prefer to ignore mistakes than fix them. The automobile industry has grown tremendously since the early days of the “horseless carriage,” first patented by Karl Benz in 1886.  There’s good reason the automobile industry is often called the “industry of industries.” In 2014 alone, some 90 million cars and commercial vehicles were produced. The automobile industry as a whole represents the world’s largest manufacturing activity. Let’s look at how this came to be.  In its early days, the auto industry was defined by craft production, meaning that highly skilled engineers and manufacturers tailored each individual car to a customer’s taste. This was slow and expensive, thus few people could afford cars – and only some 1,000 vehicles were produced yearly.  Only luxury cars are produced via craft production today. In general, the industry has moved to mass production. Inspired by Henry Ford, this change came about at the end of the twentieth century.  Henry Ford simply sought to produce more cars in less time. He realized he could achieve this by designing cars with the same, interchangeable parts and producing the parts separately, instead of working on a whole car at once.  The development of the assembly line further accelerated the manufacturing process. An early assembly line was a moving belt with workers stationed at different spots along it; each worker performed one or two simple tasks, over and over again. These basic tasks didn’t require highly specialized skills, and in fact, many assembly-line workers were immigrants who spoke little English.  The automatization of the production process meant that cars were no longer customized (or were customized very little), but instead offered a great advantage: any person could drive or even repair them, just by following a standard 150-page manual! With the innovation of mass production, a flood of cheaply produced American cars were sold worldwide. By the early 1930s, some 32 million vehicles were in use globally, and 90 percent of those were American.  Most of these vehicles were made by three leading US companies, known as the Big Three: Ford, Chrysler and General Motors. Henry Ford’s assembly-line process dominated the automobile industry for about 50 years, but this gradually changed as European companies began to compete; Germany founded Volkswagen, France Renault and Italy Fiat. As the European companies made inroads, Ford, Chrysler and General Motors began to lose their leadership positions – and even the assembly-line production process grew outdated. The problem was that mass production followed strict rules and offered little reward to workers who performed the line’s boring, repetitive tasks. As you might expect, employment turnover was high.  An assembly line was also practically unstoppable, as each process depended on the next, and time was always tight. So if a worker found a problem, he might not report it, as it was simpler to just send the defective part on down the line.  Moreover, an assembly-line manager’s performance was measured by the number of cars the line produced, so workers were essentially incentivized to ignore flaws to meet overall quotas. Mistakes were caught and repaired – in a space called the rework area – once a car had come off the assembly line. Sometimes an entire vehicle would have be taken apart and rebuilt, a costly and tedious process that caused delays. With so many moving parts to examine, even rework area employees couldn’t catch every problem, and many defective cars were sold as a result. Mass production as a process waxed and waned with companies in the United States and Europe, but it never really took hold in Japan. This was partly because demand in the Japanese automobile market was more diverse. In the United States and Europe, a majority of the market sought cheaper cars; yet in Japan, the market was broader, with more particular demands.  Politicians wanted luxury cars, farmers and entrepreneurs needed small trucks and goods sellers wanted larger trucks for transporting wares. People who lived in crowded cities wanted smaller cars that would use less oil. Thus, the one-size-fits-all vehicles produced in the West weren’t practical for the Japanese market.  Nonetheless, between 1925 and 1936, America’s Big Three dominated the Japanese market, producing some 200,000 vehicles yearly. (Japanese companies produced about 12,000.)  But the foreign influence was intentionally limited. In 1936, the Japanese government passed the Automobile Manufacturing Industry Law, which pushed American firms and their mass production techniques out of the Japanese market.  The process of mass production also wasn’t suited to the makeup of the Japanese workforce. Unlike the United States and Europe, Japan didn’t have an immigrant or “guest worker” labor class, and thus companies struggled to find low-income workers willing to do the boring, repetitive tasks required by assembly line production.  Japanese employment in general was based on long-term contracts, another barrier to the success of assembly-line manufacturing. In the hierarchical Japanese workforce, if an employee quit his job and joined another company, he had to start over at the bottom of the career ladder, even if he had accrued 20 years of experience elsewhere.  Thus once an employee started with a company, he preferred to stick with it, which left little flexibility in the workforce for the demands of assembly-line manufacturing.  In 1937, the Toyoda family founded the Toyota Motor Company. Concerned that the family name sounded too traditional (it means “abundant rice field” in Japanese), they exchanged the “d” for a “t” to create Toyota. Success didn’t come easy; by the end of the 1940s Toyota already had laid off a large portion of its workforce. But things changed when two Toyota engineers, Taichii Ohno and Eiji Toyoda, paid a visit to the Ford Rouge Factory in Michigan. Ohno and Toyoda studied Ford’s mass production techniques to see if they could make use of them back home. They soon realized that Ford’s process wasn’t ideally suited for the Japanese market, as it couldn’t produce a wide enough variety of vehicles. They also found some inefficiencies, places where both time and resources were lost.  So Ohno and Toyoda came up with what they thought was a better process for manufacturing cars, calling it the Toyota Production System, or TPS.  TPS was essentially based on the values of what we today call lean production: continuous improvement (in Japanese, kaizen) and a respect for customers and employees.  The Japanese idea of kaizen holds that processes are never perfect, and can always be improved. This concept clashes with the assembly line process, which values continuous production above all else.  In TPS, production is halted each and every time an error is identified; the system is then reexamined and refined. This is part of the reason that Toyota cars, even today, are renowned for their safety.  Importantly, TPS doesn’t just concern itself with customers’ well-being but also ensures the company respects its employees and business partners, too.  Toyota also offers on-the-job development programs to help employees climb the company’s career ladder. Such programs build workforce loyalty and help lift everyone up in the long run. Toyota’s lean principles remain influential across the globe, even today, and not just in the automobile industry. What is it that makes this process so successful? Lean production works well largely because it’s aimed at eliminating mistakes. Assembly lines, on the other hand, are focused on production output, so mistakes are easily overlooked.  Perfection is the goal for lean production. An ideal lean-production process doesn’t produce any flaws, leave excess stock or impose constraints on innovation.  Realistically, no lean-production system has ever reached complete perfection and none probably ever will, but such systems generate much better long-term results.  The lean principle of reducing waste, for example, has enabled Toyota to spend more working hours focusing on innovation. The company keeps each of its car models in production for an average of four years; in contrast, Western companies produce a car model for an average of ten years.  Lean principles also utilize the best features of both craft production and mass production.  Lean automobile production focuses on a buyer’s demands, just like craft production. The production process is based on what a customer wants, which reduces costs and prevents overproduction. Toyota is always readjusting its market goals. The company keeps track of customers and their income levels, family size and driving preferences. Then it tailors its production output to customers’ specific needs. Yet mass production methods can’t do this. Such systems produce as many cars as possible, and sometimes, there aren’t enough customers to buy them.  In the 1980s, the lean-production system finally triumphed and Japanese manufacturers overtook their American counterparts. Toyota is still the largest car manufacturer in the world today. With mass production, workers are little more than cogs in the machine. Their only responsibility is to perform the same simple tasks, over and over. That’s not how Toyota works. The company highly values the welfare of its employees. That’s why two of the company’s core values relate to employee happiness: teamwork and personal respect.  Toyota employees are guaranteed a lifetime of valuable employment. Salaries and bonuses increase with employee experience and company profitability. Workers also have access to Toyota's extensive facilities, such as housing and recreational areas.  Toyota ensures that its employees’ professional development never stops, from their first day at work (usually around age 18) until retirement. Employees are encouraged to improve their skills and given access to training, seminars and lectures.  This system benefits both sides: employees have greater job satisfaction, and the company has more knowledgeable and motivated workers.  The system also allows Toyota to give employees more responsibility. Employees are placed in teams and led by a team leader, and are tasked with overseeing parts of the production line.  The whole team works together to make the process more efficient, instead of a leader simply barking orders to subordinates. So if one team attaches car wheels, the team can freely experiment until it finds the most effective way. The leader helps to coordinate, rather than command.  If a team comes up with a larger-scale idea for improving a process (like a new way of repairing wheels, for example) it can share its ideas with company engineers in quality circles. What’s more efficient: Rushing haphazardly to finish your work or working more carefully, correcting mistakes as you go? Toyota executives would choose the second option.  In the lean-production process, workers keep an eye out for problems and investigate the roots of errors when they are brought to light. Production is paused when a mistake is found, and the power to pause production isn’t limited to managers or supervisors; any team member can do it.  Once a mistake is identified, it is analyzed so a team can prevent the error from happening again. This process is guided by The 5 Whys. If an employee notices a loose wheel, for example, he should ask, “Why is this wheel loose?” Perhaps the answer might be that it’s missing a bolt. So the next question should be, “Why is the bolt missing?” Maybe the bolt is missing because the assembly team wasn’t given the correct number of bolts. Thus the next question: “Why wasn’t the assembly team given the right supplies?” Here, perhaps the wrong supplies were ordered. Now the team should ask, “Why did that happen?” This series leads the team to the root cause: maybe the instructions for placing orders are out of date. Once the problem is solved, the production process can be resumed.  The 5 Whys approach ensures the quality of a final product, and also makes the overall process more efficient in the long run. When a team eliminates the root of a mistake, the mistake is less likely to reoccur in the future. Thanks to this process, Toyota’s cars have fewer defects than any other cars in the world.  When Toyota first started with its process, the production line was stopped often. Yet with time, the process worked out most of its kinks and became smoother and more efficient. Today, Toyota’s lines almost never have to be stopped and its plants have virtually no rework areas.  While Toyota’s own production process is based on lean principles, how does this affect its supply chain? A lean supply chain is based on the kanban system, which aims to produce only the exact amount of products that customers want. This means that car models and other products need to be constantly evolving to suit changing customer needs.  The kanban system also means that companies need to keep supply stocks low. If the company has a large inventory of wheels for Model X, for example, the wheels become useless when the company shifts to Model Z.  The kanban system utilizes a delivery system called just in time, meaning that supplies are only ordered and received just before they’re needed. So Toyota plants don’t keep a stash of car seats, for example. A plant will contact a supplier five hours before a car is ready for its seats, to make sure the plant only orders the exact quantity it needs.  Because of this Toyota has little waste, but it also means it doesn’t have much of a safety net if it or its suppliers are hit with an unexpected delay, like a natural disaster or a labor strike. If faced with such a situation, the company deals with it in two ways: First, Toyota makes sure its assembly plants are flexible, so team leaders can switch stations and cover for absent workers if necessary. Second, the company design each plant to serve more than one market. If there’s a big change in market demand, a variety of plants can be mobilized to address it.  All in all, Toyota is expert at identifying potential threats to its supply chain and developing strategies for any problems that arise. The key message in this book: Henry Ford revolutionized the automobile industry with the invention of the assembly line, but nonetheless his process was inefficient and flawed. Since mass-production systems weren’t suited to the Japanese labor market, Japanese auto manufacturer Toyota developed its own system to improve upon Ford’s early innovation. This “lean production” system was so effective that it eventually spread to other industries. Lean production is one of the reasons Toyota still leads the global automobile market, even today.

The good news is that someone has believed in you enough to give you this opportunity. However, the reality is that most new managers feel out of their depth and under pressure in their first months. So, how can you hit the ground running? Luckily, Julie Zhuo, vice president of design at Facebook, is here to show you how. Drawing on her own experience as a first-time manager, Zhuo explains how you can get those early days right and avoid the most common managerial pitfalls. Whether it’s holding awesome meetings, recruiting the perfect people or transitioning from managing a small team to a large one, these blinks walk you through everyday decisions to show what first-rate management looks like. In these blinks, you’ll discover how your path to management determines your first ninety days; why managers need to think less like fire-fighters; and how to structure your meetings. At the age of just 25, Julie Zhuo was offered the job of a lifetime – managing Facebook’s design team. More amazingly still, this role was Zhuo’s first managerial role. Thrown in at the deep end, Zhuo soon asked herself, “What does a manager actually do?” In her early days as a manager, Zhuo believed that her job consisted of holding meetings with team members, giving them feedback on how they’re doing and working out which subordinates to promote or to fire. However, she soon realized that her approach was short-sighted as it focused on basic daily tasks, rather than long-term goals. After a few years of experience under her belt, Zhuo became more strategic. She realized that a manager’s role was actually to focus on wider issues. These include ensuring her team was working effectively together, helping team members achieve their career aims and developing processes to improve efficiency without any hiccups along the way. But now, with nearly a decade of management experience behind her, Zhuo believes that the answer to what a manager does is far more concise than either of her previous lists capture. The job of a manager, as it turns out, is to achieve improved outcomes from your team. As you work toward this goal, you’ll begin to recognize the difference between a good manager and a mediocre one. How? Well, many people assume a box-ticking attitude when considering whether a manager is a good one. For instance, you might assess whether they are hard-working, likable or good at giving presentations. If they check all three boxes, then they must be a good manager. Right? Wrong. Actually, only the outcome of the team they manage can answer this question. In other words, the team of a good manager will achieve good results – consistently. So, ask yourself what outcome your team or business seeks. If, like Zhuo, the outcome you’re looking for is great design, then remember that an excellent manager’s team will consistently pitch you great designs, whereas a mediocre manager’s team will pitch you mediocre designs. A great manager is one whose team gets great results. It really is that simple – no box-ticking or long lists necessary. When the author bumps into new managers at Facebook, she asks which aspects of the job they’ve found easier or more challenging than expected. She’s noticed a pattern in their responses. How they come into the management role in the first place determines what the new managers find easy or difficult in their first three months. There are several possible paths to becoming a manager, and each route comes with its own potential opportunities and pitfalls during those early months. First, there is the Apprentice path to management. The Apprentice path begins when your boss’s team grows and she asks you to manage part of it. This was the author’s route to management. As a young designer at Facebook, she was asked to manage part of her boss’s growing design team. One advantage of this route is that you’ll have plenty of guidance during your early months because your own manager will still be around to coach you and answer any questions you may have. However, establishing a good rapport with those working under you can be tricky for apprentice managers. Why? Because they’re used to seeing you as a peer, not as their boss. Second is the Pioneer route to management. Pioneers start entirely new teams and are responsible for all aspects of that team’s growth. One key advantage of this route is that you get to build your team, rather than inherit it. Thus, you can select who you want to work with and engineer the team dynamics. On the downside, pioneer managers may not receive much support, as no one will understand your team better than you. Therefore, others may find it difficult to help with your particular challenges. Finally, there is the New Boss path to management. In this scenario, you are brought in, either from a different team or even a different organization, to manage an established workgroup. One advantage of being a new boss is that people will typically cut you some slack during your first few months. Why? Because they’ll appreciate that you’re a newbie, and thus you’re allowed to make mistakes while you learn how everything works. Moreover, it’s important that you make use of this time to sit back and learn. One of the pitfalls of being a new boss is to rush in and change things without fully understanding the nuances of your new position. Understanding your route to management and its unique challenges and advantages will help you hit the ground running. Zhuo still remembers the worst feedback she ever received. When critiquing one of her designs for Facebook, a former colleague asked, “Is this supposed to be this awful?” Although this example is extreme, the truth is that many of us struggle to hit the right tone when giving others feedback. Either we worry about hurting someone’s feelings and refrain from all criticism, or, as in the above case, we aren’t sensitive enough. Nonetheless, providing effective, insightful feedback to team members is an essential component of a manager’s job. So, how do you get better at holding these important, yet challenging, conversations? Crucially, you should provide feedback that is specific to one particular task, optimally a task that someone has just completed. For instance, if a team member has just given a presentation, set aside time afterward to tell them what you think went well and how they might improve next time. Activity-specific feedback like this is the most straightforward. Why? Because it revolves around what someone has done, rather than who they are. For this type of feedback to be most effective, it’s important to deliver it as soon as you can so that the task remains fresh in your minds. For instance, you could provide feedback in an email on the same day that a task is completed. Unless the task is particularly important, this written feedback will be just as effective as a face-to-face conversation. Lastly, by making activity-specific feedback a regular habit, your team members will receive little coaching sessions after every task they undertake. Another way to give great feedback is to bring in a multitude of perspectives. You can accomplish this by conducting 360-degree feedback sessions. This type of feedback takes the opinions of many different people into account. For instance, if a member of your team just gave a presentation, rather than sending them just your thoughts on the performance, you might share what other people thought too. This type of feedback is valuable because it provides a well-rounded and objective view of how the team member is performing. In the modern workplace, meetings have suffered a fall from grace. All too often, the weekly team meeting is derided as dull, bureaucratic and a waste of time. As a manager, the author has seen her fair share of disastrous get-togethers – meetings in which each attendee takes their turn to moan about mundane issues, while their colleagues quietly get on with other work or simply stare into space. So, how can you make meetings productive instead of pointless? When the author first became a manager, she thought the key to good meetings was to ensure they had an explicit purpose. With this in mind, she held a weekly team meeting to discuss how her team members were progressing with their various projects. Nonetheless, even with this explicit aim in mind, her team still found the meetings vague and redundant. In fact, after someone pointed out that the team could just as well send email updates on their progress, she canceled the meetings altogether. After this debacle, she realized that simply having an agenda for a meeting is not enough. In addition, you must have a clear idea of the successful outcome of the meeting. For instance, a successful outcome of your meeting might be that the team makes a decision. If this is the case, then your meeting must include certain things. Quite clearly, it must involve a decision, but it also needs to include everyone who is directly impacted by this decision. During the meeting, all conceivable options, including relevant information, must be presented objectively. Further, any recommendations the team might have should be articulated. Lastly, your meeting needs to apportion equal time to different opinions and ensure everyone feels their voices are heard. Managers can help with this by calling on attendees who haven’t spoken yet to give their opinion to the group. Thus, it should be clear that all views, no matter how divergent, will be respected. Alternatively, the intended outcome of your meeting might simply be to share information, rather than decide on something. In this scenario, your meeting needs to accomplish different things. For example, a successful information-sharing meeting should capture attendees’ attention and keep it. This can be achieved through good pacing, facilitating interaction and even presenting information through storytelling. As a manager, hiring the right people for your team is one of the most important duties you’ll have. Indeed, after over a decade at Facebook, the author has been involved in the decision to recruit thousands of her colleagues. As a manager, how can you ensure you’re hiring the right people for your team? First, when it comes to recruitment, make sure you know what you’re looking for. All too often, managers approach recruitment like they are fighting a fire. They see a problem, a gap that needs to be filled, and they try to solve it as quickly as they can. When managers become overly focused with simply filling a vacancy, they usually don’t stop to think about what skills, attributes or experience they’re looking for in a candidate. This can easily lead to hiring the wrong person for your team. Luckily, you can stop thinking like a firefighter and start acting like a manager by planning ahead. At the beginning of each calendar year, the author maps out her team’s goals for the next twelve months. As part of this process, she analyzes all the gaps in her team’s skills, experiences and strengths. She then creates a list of vacancies that she needs to recruit for, according to these gaps. Similarly, you can create your own tailor-made recruitment plan by answering some basic questions. First, take a look at your team’s priorities, expected rate of attrition and budget for the coming year. Based on this information, decide how many new recruits you can realistically hire. Next, ask yourself how much experience each new recruit should have. Then, think about what strengths and skills your team needs more of, such as creativity, operational know-how or expertise in a particular area. You should also consider what strengths your team already has in abundance. These are the areas in which your new recruits can afford to be weaker. Lastly, ask yourself what personalities, previous experiences or traits would strengthen your team’s diversity. Having a well-considered one-year plan gives you a useful framework for assessing candidates’ suitability. It also ensures you won’t simply hand out a job to the next available person. When Julie Zhuo first became a manager, her team consisted of a handful of designers, and each new recruit was a cause for excitement. Fast forward ten years and the size of her team has quadrupled. Crucially, the growth of her team has also led to Zhuo’s growth as a manager. As it turns out, leading a small team is very different from leading a large one. For instance, if you’re managing only a handful of individuals, your working relationship will probably be more personal. With such a small team, you can grasp the particulars of each person’s work and understand what each individual cares about, where their strengths lie and even what they like to do in their free time. But when your team swells to 30 individuals, you won’t be able to manage them directly. After all, if you met with every person for a one-on-one conversation each week for half an hour, you’d spend around half your week in meetings! Inevitably, when your team grows beyond a certain point, you must hire another manager to work beneath you so that you can offload all those one-on-one conversations. In other words, you will now manage most of your team indirectly. However, indirect management brings its own challenges. As the overall manager, you’ll still be responsible for the work of your team, but you’ll also be removed from a lot of the day-to-day decisions that get made. This loss of control can be disturbing at first, so don’t worry if it takes time to find the middle ground between deep-diving into a problem and stepping back and trusting your middle managers to handle it. Another problem of managing a large team is that your team members might start to behave differently around you. For instance, as her team got bigger, the author found that the people she indirectly managed were less willing to challenge her opinion or tell her when they were unhappy with something. When she asked one of her direct reports why this was happening, he explained that they found her seniority intimidating. Thus, it’s important for managers of large teams to remember that no matter how friendly they might be, their position of authority, coupled with their distance from their indirect reports, might lead their team to see them as unapproachable. To combat this, managers should emphasize that they welcome opinions different from theirs, and make a point of rewarding people who express dissent. The key message in these blinks: Your first managerial position will hold opportunities and pitfalls, depending on your particular path to management. You can excel by focusing on getting great outcomes from your team meetings, your hiring decisions and your team itself.  Actionable advice: Accountability gets results. Imagine a scenario in which you ask four members of your team to come up with new ideas for making an app easier to use. You tell them to take the best ideas forward, but at the end of the month, no decisions have been made. This may be because you didn’t designate an overall decision-maker. When you delegate tasks to groups, ensure that you’ve clearly defined who is accountable for what, and who is responsible for making decisions. Otherwise, your team will spend too much time debating whose ideas are the best and trying to persuade each other. Simply, if you want something done, assign authority to one person, not a group.

Sutton","summary":"We all have bad days and act like assholes every now and then; we are all temporary assholes occasionally. Certified assholes, on the other hand, are people whose asshole-behavior is not a temporary outburst on a bad day – rather, it is part of their character. These are people whose bad behavior is continuous and long term. This hostile behavior can be expressed both physically and mentally. It may be verbal or non-verbal. Assholes leave their victims angry, afraid, and humiliated. In the workplace, this can be expressed in many ways: Assholes interrupt others while they speak, they violate their personal space, insult and intimidate them, put others down, stare at them aggressively or ignore them altogether. Assholes often get away with this behavior by treating their own bosses or customers respectfully, whilst treating everyone else poorly. Hiding behavior like this can be very effective if lower-level employees feel the asshole’s good reputation with superiors would lead to their complaints being ignored. The general rule is: Assholes is the right term for all those people who regularly bully or put down others. Lots of workplaces tolerate poor behavior without realizing the damage it causes. In offices where assholes go unchallenged, employee morale is undeniably lower than in comparable workplaces which maintain a friendly, respectful and professional atmosphere. This has a huge effect on everybody’s productivity. Employees with low morale are more likely to resign, take more sick leave and are generally less productive. They may get their own back by skipping work, producing poor results, or even stealing. Assholes sap their colleagues’ energy – that goes for onlookers working in a hostile environment as well as direct victims. Assholes in positions of power are particularly damaging. The employees under their management work with the constant threat of humiliation and expend their energy on avoiding it rather than focusing on good work. This quickly leads to a fearful, unproductive atmosphere. Tolerating assholes is therefore a costly mistake for a business. The quality of work goes down as the best employees, who have more options available, leave for asshole-free workplaces. Assholes are bad for business – especially when they hold management positions. All too often assholes are tolerated in the workplace. Their temper tantrums and spitefulness are put down to character flaws and excused because they are talented, smart, or difficult to replace. But in doing so, businesses are effectively hurting themselves; all assholes should be weeded out from the workforce from the very beginning. To put it another way, it makes sense to regard an employee who cannot get along with their colleagues and makes them feel uncomfortable or upset as incompetent, regardless of their other qualities or abilities. This No Asshole Rule should be applied to all, whatever their qualifications. The founders and managers of a business should always make it clear that all their employees deserve to be treated with respect. This pays its own reward in loyalty and high employee morale. Life is too short to put up with assholes. To put this rule into effect, it needs to be well known by all employees. Google’s slogan “Don’t be evil” is a good example of this. The rule should also be extended to customers and clients, as their behavior can have just as much of an effect on job satisfaction and morale as an employee’s. Some airlines, for example, blacklist customers who have mistreated their staff by e.g. screaming at them or threatening them. To create a great working-environment, businesses should adopt the No Asshole Rule. Studies have repeatedly shown that people given higher status are more likely to behave like assholes. They talk more than others, take what they want without considering the people around them; in general they tend to see others just as a means to an end and take personal credit for a group success. One such study had groups of three students discuss various issues. One student per group had been randomly chosen to rate the others’ arguments. The results were that these more powerful students tended to break social conventions more frequently. This was measured by providing a shared plate of cookies; the higher-status students were more likely to take the last cookie, chew with their mouth open and leave more crumbs behind. The same effect is very noticeable in the business world. The greater the difference in status between managers and employees, the more lower-ranking workers are treated disrespectfully. In order to reduce asshole behavior, a business should seek to reduce the social distance between employees. This leads to more respectful behavior, especially between managers and subordinates. One way of doing this is to keep wage differences as narrow as possible. Earnings are the most important sign of status in the business world – by keeping wage gaps as unspectacular as possible, a company can reduce the differences in status that lead to workplace bullying. More equality equals fewer assholes. Every office worker knows that groups of managers can be pretty similar to groups of baboons. There are fierce rivalries between competing managers, and the most aggressive one often wins. The interesting thing is, even though individuals acting aggressive and reckless are often rewarded as cold and unpleasant, but also as competent and resourceful. Being cold and ruthless can be just as much of an advantage in the business world as in the Mafia or a tribe of chimpanzees. This can be explained by evolution; throughout the rise of man, the most aggressive, loudest member of the group became leader. Hence, our brains have evolved to associate aggression with high status. However, this doesn’t mean that it’s a good idea for companies to promote assholes to positions of power or to tolerate aggression in the first place. Techniques that work well at outcompeting rivals do not translate well into good management techniques; rather than motivating subordinates, they often have the exact opposite effect. Two things best motivate people: incentives and recognition. Not only do these positive techniques get better results than aggression and punishment – a tyrant’s power only lasts as long as they’re around to enforce it – but they keep office morale high. The best employees, who can more easily find work elsewhere, are less likely to stay in a workplace given a negative atmosphere by tolerance of assholes; the people that stay behind are those that have few other options. Assholes drive away the cream of the workforce, whilst implementing the No Asshole Rule will help to attract and keep talented workers. Being an asshole can be an advantage, but motivating employees through incentives is more effective. The business world is a cut-throat place; competition between firms is fierce and unending. This attitude is all too often carried over into companies’ internal cultures. Naturally, healthy competition between individuals can be good for a company; ambition is a great way to motivate employees to greater efforts, to take risks, and to come up with new ideas. It also helps to select the best candidates for promotion. However, in the scrabble for advancement, rivalries can turn sour and the best interests of the company are easily forgotten. Too much internal competition can effectively hamstring a company and make it an uncivilized, unproductive workplace. This is the reason that the most successful companies are often those in which internal competition is restrained and a culture of co-operation fostered. Not only does this produce a more civilized atmosphere, but also better results. To achieve this, it’s important firstly to note and reward co-operation. Subtle approaches such as choice of vocabulary can have a surprising effect on a company’s culture. Replacing aggressive, often warlike words and phrases (‘the enemy’, ‘battleground’ etc.) with more positive alternatives, stressing co-operation (‘help’, ‘fairness’, ‘community’) can be particularly effective. Even such simple changes such as referring to ‘we’, ‘our’, and ‘us’ rather than ‘I’, ‘my’, and ‘them’ can subconsciously remind employees that they’re all on the same team and direct focus towards co-operation rather than the differences and rivalries that sap time and energy. To create a civilized, productive workplace, focus on cooperation, rather than internal competition. Being an asshole is highly contagious. Just as the proverb says “Lie down with dogs and you’ll rise with fleas,” simply being around angry and aggressive people noticeably alters your mood and behavior. If you find yourself working in a rude and disrespectful culture, you soon get used to rudeness and lack of respect, and gradually come to display both towards others. This behavior also has a way of creeping into private life and so has consequences far beyond the business world. Sutton himself notes how he started treating his wife worse after spending too much time amongst assholes. So to avoid becoming a certified asshole in both your business and private life, avoid assholes as far as possible. Of course, you can’t always choose your co-workers, so if avoiding assholes isn’t an option, try to keep contact to a minimum to keep your exposure as low as possible. It helps to think of being an asshole as a virus – you’d avoid close contact with a colleague who has the flu, so treat assholes the same way. Of course, it’s always easier to do something from the start than it is to change course later on. If you’ve already invested a lot of time and energy into a relationship with an asshole, it’s going to be more difficult to distance yourself from them. Hence, whenever you face an asshole, get off as quickly as possible! Avoid assholes or you’ll become one yourself. In many workplaces it’s impossible to completely avoid contact with assholes. Working with, or worse, under an asshole can be very demoralizing, even if you don’t realize at first how much stress it actually causes, so it’s very important to have a good strategy to allow you to get through the day unscathed. Generally, the most important thing is not to let an asshole drag you down to his level. It’s difficult, but try to remain calm, don’t respond to aggression with more aggression, and keep as much distance as possible between yourself and any hurtful things being said. It may help to remind yourself that the person you’re dealing with is just an asshole, no matter how senior they may be. To build emotional distance, treat interactions with known assholes with a positive frame of mind. Remember: The problem is only temporary. You’re not the cause of the problem. It’s not going to ruin the rest of your life. If somebody’s an asshole, that’s their problem, not yours. Anticipating an uncomfortable situation with an asshole, it’s helpful to always hope for the best whilst preparing for the worst. Happiness (and sadness) is found in the difference between what you expect and what you experience. So when dealing with an asshole, be prepared for the worst, but remember that it’s due to the other person and not you. Don’t let assholes get to you – build emotional distance. Everyone knows that it only takes one asshole to ruin a conversation, whether in the office, at a party or just in everyday life. Even if everyone else is behaving normally, one asshole can spoil the mood. Negative things affect our mood five times more than positives, meaning that meeting five nice people who compliment you and bring you good news might easily be neutralized by encountering one single asshole. So, everyone should know about and apply the No Asshole Rule, in both their professional and private lives. This means, zero tolerance for assholes. That said, it’s also important to avoid becoming an asshole yourself, or if you already are, to try to change negative behavior. The first step is to take an honest look in the mirror and ask yourself when was the last time you acted like an asshole. In fact the way to avoid being an asshole is simple; be friendly and respectful to other people at all times, and expect the same treatment in return. Because life’s too short to put up with assholes. Everyone should use the No Asshole Rule all the time. The key message in this book is: Companies should have a zero tolerance policy towards assholes and bad behavior. This raises employee morale, productivity and company loyalty. The book answers the following questions: How do you spot an asshole, and what harm do they cause? Assholes is the right term for all those people who regularly bully or put down others. Assholes are bad for business – especially when they hold management positions. How should companies deal with assholes? To create a great working-environment, businesses should adopt the No Asshole Rule. More equality equals fewer assholes. Being an asshole can be an advantage, but motivating employees through incentives is more effective. To create a civilized, productive workplace, focus on cooperation, rather than internal competition. How can individuals deal with assholes? Avoid assholes or you’ll become one yourself. Don’t let assholes get to you – build emotional distance. Everyone should use the No Asshole Rule all the time.","headers":["Assholes is the right term for all those people who regularly bully or put down others.","Assholes are bad for business – especially when they hold management positions.","To create a great working-environment, businesses should adopt the No Asshole Rule.","More equality equals fewer assholes.","Being an asshole can be an advantage, but motivating employees through incentives is more effective.","To create a civilized, productive workplace, focus on cooperation, rather than internal competition.","Avoid assholes or you’ll become one yourself.","Don’t let assholes get to you – build emotional distance.","Everyone should use the No Asshole Rule all the time.","Final summary"],"category":"Leadership","image_url":"https://images.blinkist.com/images/books/528242003334640008600000/3_4/470.jpg","synopsis":"The No Asshole Rule delves into the problem of bullying or aggressive co-workers, who in many cases rise to management positions.

So instead of avoiding them, we have to tackle them straight on, use them to our advantage, and transform them into conditions for our success. This book shows us the way. In these blinks you’ll learn how one famous figure fought for his inheritance by practicing public speaking with pebbles in his mouth! And you’ll find out what Thomas Edison did when his million-dollar laboratory burned down – destroying all his latest prototypes. Finally, you’ll learn how NASA prepares its astronauts to tackle life-threatening obstacles. When faced with an obstacle, most of us get angry, fearful and frustrated. We think it will derail our plans and hinder our progress. But obstacles can actually become advantages, and far from limiting us, they can lead us to success. How? To turn an obstacle into an advantage, we have to focus on three things. First, we should focus on our perception of the obstacle. If we can see an obstacle in the right light, we can reveal the hidden possibilities we can use to our advantage. This was the key to the oil baron John D. Rockefeller’s success. During a financial crisis in 1857, Rockefeller, only 18 years old, watched how those who panicked behaved, and observed what they did wrong. By analyzing their failures, Rockefeller was able to see the obstacle – the Panic – in another way. He was then able to perceive the advantages the crisis offered, take action and start on his way to becoming one of the world’s richest men. But perception alone is not enough. When you are faced with an obstacle, you also need to respond with the correct action. The correct action is born from the combination of creativity and flexibility. For example, at the beginning of the twentieth century, Amelia Earhart wanted to become a great pilot, but an obstacle stood in her way – back in those days, women just didn’t become pilots. So she took a mundane job to survive, but kept looking for creative ways to accomplish her dream. One day she received a call saying that someone would fund the first female transatlantic flight, but she could only be an unpaid passenger. Though this was far from what she wanted to accomplish, she accepted – and this jumping off point led to a career as a great aviator. After identifying the best way to perceive an obstacle and the best action to overcome it, we use our will to persevere until the obstacle has been overcome. Over the next few blinks we'll look at each of these in more detail – starting with perception. When you encounter an obstacle, how do you respond? Do you think the world might be against you, and that nothing ever goes your way? Instead, you should be thinking about taking a step back, looking at the situation objectively and thinking, “What can I do to turn this obstacle into an advantage?” If we look at them in this way, even the biggest obstacles can be turned to our advantage. For example, in the 1960s the then celebrated boxer Rubin “Hurricane” Carter was falsely accused of a triple homicide, and sentenced to jail for life. But as he entered prison, he resolved to not let his circumstances overwhelm him, and instead tried to see how he could make the best of it. First, he vowed to not live with the injustice, but keep fighting to overcome it through the court of law. Then he turned his limited physical freedom to his advantage by using his time inside to study history, philosophy and law. Carter’s case was eventually overturned and he was released after 19 years. Carter left jail as he had entered it, a free man. But in addition, he had also used the time to improve his education and himself. So how can we achieve this objective perspective? By learning to detach yourself from your own personal – and highly subjective – view of the situation. You can do this by imagining that you are advising a friend about overcoming the obstacle. What would you say to them? How would you let them approach it? Or you can take after the Stoics, a group of philosophers from Ancient Greece. They would imagine how a sage – a person of perfect wisdom – would react to the obstacle. In that way, they would explore hidden sources of wisdom that they didn’t consciously know they had. Our first reactions to an obstacle are usually anger, frustration, anxiety and confusion. Though natural, such emotional outbursts actually make it harder for us to deal with obstacles because not only do they prevent us from judging the situation objectively, they actually make us see it differently. So if we want to turn our obstacles into success, we have to learn to control our emotions. How? The key to controlling our emotions is to steady our nerves. A famous role model for steely nerves is the Civil War general, Ulysses S. Grant. He was once being photographed by famous photographer Matthew Brady when he nearly lost his life. As there wasn’t enough light for the photo, Brady asked an assistant to open the studio’s skylight. But the assistant accidently broke the window, and large shards of glass fell right next to where Grant was sitting. If he had panicked and jumped from his chair, he might have been seriously hurt – but Grant didn’t flinch, and sat calmly in his chair as the shards shattered around him. By controlling his nerves, Grant prevented his emotions from getting him hurt. So how can we gain control over our emotions? By preparing ourselves for what can go wrong in any situation. This allows us to remain calm no matter how much external events may change. NASA has realized how important this is. A panicking astronaut is the single largest factor that contributes to potentially life-threatening mistakes in outer space. That’s why NASA prepares its astronauts to respond to any possible obstacle until their reaction becomes automatic. This allows them to deal with stress when anything goes wrong with the initial plan. Emotional responses to obstacles blur our judgment, thus making it impossible to turn obstacles to our advantage. When we are met with an obstacle, we often only see it in one way: insurmountable. But if we can change our perspective, then we can reveal the advantages an obstacle hides beneath the surface. How? By taking the larger context into consideration. Looking at the situation in isolation often makes the obstacle seem impenetrable; but if we place it in context, we can often see that it’s truly unimportant. For example, when setting out to battle during the Ancient Greek Peloponnesian War, the general Pericles and his men were suddenly cast into darkness by a solar eclipse. Many soldiers saw this as a bad omen, and became afraid of the impending battle. But Pericles was undaunted, and used this situation to his advantage to motivate his men. He took a dark shroud and placed it over the face of one of his soldiers, and asked him if he was afraid. The soldier replied that he wasn’t. Pericles then asked why they should allow another cause for darkness to deter them in battle and make them fearful. This allowed the soldiers to see the eclipse in a new light, and become emboldened for the fight. Perspective can also be used to transform obstacles into advantages. George Clooney learned this early on in his career. When he first came to Hollywood, he struggled to land a role. He became angry at directors, producers and casting agents, blaming them for not recognizing his talent. But then he changed his perspective. He realized that it was not his obstacle, but the film producers’ – they were the ones who desperately needed to find the right actor. So Clooney decided to mentally approach the audition as the actor they were looking for. He believed that if he made himself stand out as the solution to their obstacle, he would get the job. And by changing his personal perspective, Clooney was able to transform the initial obstacle into the first stepping stone towards success. In the following blinks, we’ll find out what’s the best course of action when confronted with the many obstacles of life. We’ve seen the importance of changing perspective, but on its own, it’s not enough – we also have to take action. However, in the face of the many obstacles that separate us from the good life, we need more than a single act – we need the strict discipline to act, and keep acting until the obstacle is overcome. One person who proved that discipline wins out was Demosthenes – the greatest orator of ancient Athens. On top of being cheated out of his inheritance by his guardians, Demosthenes was a sickly and frail person with a speech impediment. But when faced with all these obstacles he didn’t give up. Instead, he came up with a plan of action and stuck to it with incredible discipline. He locked himself in his study and taught himself law so he could take his former guardians to court. And to improve his speech, he would repeatedly recite oratory with his mouth full of pebbles! Through his persistence, Demosthenes became not only the most famous orator in Athens, but also won his trial against his ex-guardians. Just like Demosthenes, the inventor and entrepreneur Thomas Edison knew that effective action depends on our persistence. In 1878, Edison went through 6,000 different types of material in order to discover the correct filament (a piece of bamboo) for the incandescent light bulb. Though there were other inventors also attempting to discover the incandescent bulb at the time, no other inventor went through so many different experiments to make sure they got it. It’s this persistence and tenacity that is universally recognized as the key to Edison’s great success. Imagine you’re part of a long-term project, and however persistently you act, it seems that the obstacles just keep on coming. What should you do? Instead of thinking about the goal, you should focus on each moment and the overall process. Why? Because this allows us to deal with the tasks at hand as effectively as we can, which will increase our chances of long-term success. Let’s look at two highly successful companies that were both formed in incredibly difficult economic times. The Walt Disney Company was formed eleven months prior to the market crash of 1929. And the IT company, Hewlett-Packard, was formed during the Great Depression in 1935. Both these companies succeeded because they didn’t let the problems in the wider economy derail their thinking about day-to-day activities. Instead of concentrating on the overwhelming goal of becoming successful in times of economic crisis, they kept focused on the moment at hand, not the obstacles surrounding them. And step by step, they grew into the famous companies we know today. Another way of looking at this is to see each moment as part of the larger process that leads toward the goal. Professional sport coaches use this paradigm to transform what might look like the impossible effort to climb a mountain into the single, regular steps necessary to reach to the top. For example, Nick Saban, head coach of the University of Alabama American football team, teaches his players to follow the process. Saban tells his players not to focus on the goal of winning the championship, but rather on performing well in each game, and each play in the games. Breaking down the road to the goal in this way allows his players to invest their energy in the task at hand without worrying about all the “obstacles” such as defeats or possible injuries. Correct action depends upon focusing on the entire process and living within each moment of that process. Sometimes you will be faced with an obstacle so huge you’ll think you can’t overcome it. But often the largest obstacles hide the largest weaknesses. For example, Gandhi’s civil disobedience – the non-violent movement known as satyagraha – and in particular, the Salt March, show how great power can be turned against itself. Gandhi knew he couldn’t challenge Britain’s military rule in a direct conflict, so he decided to use non-violence and symbolic acts to show how unjust it was. His Salt March led hundreds of thousands of Indians to the ocean to collect salt in direct opposition to the British law that prohibited unregulated salt collection. And because it was a non-violent endeavor, it contested the British rule without lifting an arm in combat. The great strength of the empire was its monopoly of violence, and by challenging it non-violently, he was able to show how weak it actually was. Another way to exploit an obstacle’s weakness is to use its strengths against it. Alexander the Great did this when he tamed his horse, the wild Bucephalus. Until Alexander gentled him, Bucephalus would not allow anyone to ride him, and would fight off anyone who tried with furious anger. So Alexander made Bucephalus run in a straight line until the horse was exhausted, and gave up trying to resist. When Alexander then mounted him, the stallion let Alexander steer and control him. Alexander had used his strength in riding (his endurance) to tame Bucephalus by exploiting the horse’s obvious weakness (its constant anger used up its energy). So by using its strengths against itself, even the strongest obstacle can be overcome. In the following blinks, we’ll learn how to keep persevering despite constant obstacles. Perception – the ability to see a situation objectively – and action (the practical skill of transforming the obstacle into our advantage) are, by themselves, not always enough. What really makes the difference is the last ingredient: our will. Unless we believe in ourselves and apply this internal power to all our actions, we will be unable to turn obstacles into advantages. The will is what channels our perception and action into recognizing and changing what we can, and not worrying about things we cannot. This philosophy was developed by the Stoics in Ancient Athens and Rome, such as Epictetus, Seneca and Emperor Marcus Aurelius. They focused their will by always asking themselves what was in their control and what was not. They believed that we could not change external factors. These include natural events, other people’s actions, the inevitability of death, etc. They also believed, however, that we could change internal factors. These include our emotions, judgments, attitudes, responses and decisions. Armed with this knowledge, we can then apply our will to change what we are able to change – i.e., our internal obstacles – while still facing and accepting the external obstacles we will inevitably encounter. This principle is embodied in Thomas Edison’s reaction to a terrible blow to his career. In the early 1900s, when Edison was 67 years old, his research and production campus caught fire. When Edison arrived on the scene, the whole building – including all his prototypes, papers and research – had gone up in flames. But Edison was unfazed, and saw this event as an opportunity to start over. He realized that he could not undo the fact of the fire, but could change his perspective, and approach a seemingly insurmountable obstacle as a way of starting over – getting “rid of a lot of rubbish,” he called it. And at the end of the year, Edison had turned a million dollar loss into a $10 million profit. By learning to accept what we cannot change, and disciplining our will to change what we can, we can master our obstacles – and ourselves. This disciplined will allows us to persevere in the face of the most difficult obstacles, as shown in one of the founding texts of Western literature, the Odyssey, by the Ancient Greek poet Homer. In the Odyssey, we find Odysseus departing Troy after ten years of fighting. Little does he know that he will spend another ten years facing many trials and tribulations as he attempts to reach home. Along the way, he is held prisoner, faces temptation, loses all of his men, encounters dangerous whirlpools, and even fights off a cyclops and a six-headed monster! What allowed him to overcome all the obstacles sent by the gods? His will to get home. Another way our will can push us to the limits of human possibility is its power to ignore our personal situation in favor of more important goals. This is perfectly illustrated by James Stockdale, a US pilot taken prisoner during the Vietnam War. Prisoners of war knew that they would be tortured and quite possibly killed. But instead of giving up or simply fearing for his life, Stockdale decided to be a leader for his fellow prisoners. Knowing that some of the tortured might be driven insane, Stockdale formed a support system in the camp to make sure all the soldiers knew they were in it together and should not feel ashamed for having given information. By using his will to concentrate on the greater goal of survival, Stockdale was able to help himself and others endure years of imprisonment and torture – and come out on the other side alive.

The duo’s acrimonious split not only led to a lengthy legal fight but also cost them their long-term friendship. Business partnerships don’t have to be like this. Yet if you ever start a company with a friend or colleague, there are a few things worth considering before you start that will save you a lot of trouble – and potentially heartache – down the line. Saving the tough things for tomorrow may work for lots of things in life, but as these blinks will show you, when it comes to creating a sustainable business partnership, that hard talk today will mean lasting success tomorrow and in the future. In these blinks, you’ll learn why honesty is not only good manners but also good business sense; how pre-dawn frostbite almost broke Ben & Jerry’s Ice Cream; and how control might be worth more than cash when it comes to a fair partnership. Going at it alone isn’t an easy path, which is why so many entrepreneurs find a business partner. But a business partnership doesn’t always succeed. And although such relationships are rewarding and profitable when they do work, a failed partnership can potentially ruin your life. On the other hand, working with someone else makes it much easier to start and run a business, as you can combine skills and share responsibilities. And that’s exactly why Inc. magazine’s annual list of fastest-growing companies is chock-full of partner-led enterprises. Yet the downside is that a partnership gone wrong can have devastating consequences. Even in the best-case scenario, when partners manage to work out disagreements privately and avoid litigation, the costs of lost job satisfaction is huge. And that doesn’t even begin to cover emotional damage, either. That’s exactly why you should discuss all the details with a prospective partner before committing to a business relationship. Although you can never be fully certain whether a partnership will blossom or wither, it does help to discuss important matters, ideally before you’ve started working together. To that end, take advantage of the Partnership Charter. We’ll look at three key aspects of communication with a business partner, considering business details, personal relationships and future development of your business. These steps are easy to follow, and at the end, you’ll have a written charter documenting each partner’s goals and expectations. There’s no better way to start a partnership correctly! Let’s jump in! On the business side, partners should start a conversation by agreeing on the mission, vision and strategic direction of the company. Your company’s mission articulates what your company does, for whom and for what reason. This can be captured in a mission statement. Your vision is what you see as your company’s competitive edge. It doesn’t have to be groundbreaking but it should be unique. For example, FedEx wasn’t the first logistics company in the world, but it does strive to deliver more reliably than any of its competitors – that’s vision! If partners don’t share a vision and a mission, they’ll get nowhere. And yet, finding consensus might be far more difficult than you would expect. After all, a vision and a mission are abstract concepts and relate to the future. That’s why partners should make sure they also agree on a strategic direction, something that everyone in the company will have to live with daily. Strategic direction is basically the route your company will take to achieve its goals. It includes an action plan that outlines an implementation strategy for each goal. To create it, partners should start by taking inventory of their personal resources and considering how they’ll be affected by certain business challenges, such as borrowing capacity or industry hurdles.   Agreeing on a strategic direction from the outset is important, as partners will be confronted by new issues constantly. For instance, a founder might be shocked to learn that her partner has been borrowing money from friends to fund the company. But if you discuss important matters from the outset, you’ll be able to avoid large and potentially destructive misunderstandings down the line. How would you establish matters of ownership and engagement with a business partner? Like most people, you’d probably create a legally binding document. Although important, a legal document only covers a fraction of what you should actually consider before embarking on a business partnership. First, you both need to decide which role each of you will play to ensure your company functions smoothly. This is tricky, since there are a limited number of jobs in every company. This means that one partner may have to assume a lesser role, or take a position he doesn’t particularly like, which could lead to resentment or anger. Both partners should think about assigned roles carefully before plowing ahead. For example, Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield of Ben & Jerry’s Ice Cream divided the business right from the beginning. Jerry handled the manufacturing while Ben was responsible for marketing and sales. Both jobs needed to be filled, and each partner was satisfied to exercise his unique skills. Similarly, partners also need to figure out how to divide ownership to avoid power struggles later on. To determine ownership fairly, it’s important to consider the company’s overall needs and how each partner adds value through his or her role. It’s also important to note that ownership can mean different things to different partners. Some partners might want more equity, while others desire more control over business operations. Understanding each partner’s particular interest can make the ownership discussion easier. You could, for example, give one partner a bigger salary while the other assumes a more powerful role. But don’t forget to discuss how you’ll handle things when ownership inevitably changes, such as when a partner dies, gets divorced or is bought out. Or even when a new partner is added. Building a business that lasts long enough to be profitable is not easy. In fact, it may seem impossible at first. Yet partners still need to agree on what will happen when their business eventually succeeds. Division of profits is one important point. Do you want to earn money through a salary, through dividends, an exit strategy or something else? You’ll need to take different factors into account. Personal circumstances are the first key factor. Can you go without a salary for a longer period of time? Does your partner expect a quick profit or a stable paycheck? The answers to these questions will vary wildly from person to person. Partners need to be blunt about what they need and expect. Partners too need to take the company’s needs into account. Will the business go bankrupt if you’re paying out huge salaries? How much money do you need to invest from the outset? A final point of consideration has to do with finances and taxes. For example, if you can reduce company taxes by paying yourself via bonuses rather than dividends, this should be considered. In any case, partners should make sure compensation is fair for both parties by considering what each person will contribute. For example, if one partner invests money at the start (but leaves operations to the other partner), she may have a bigger stake in company equity, but no regular salary. Apart from profits, partners also need to discuss issues of governance. Down the line, founders may have the option to add an advisory board to oversee the executive level. Partners should discuss whether such a board would be necessary, who might be on it and what its responsibilities would be. All these business-related details are important, but partners also need to discuss their personal relationship, in and out of work. Read on to learn how to navigate the stickier personal side of your business partnership! Whether two people get along often seems a matter of chemistry. But it’s not just that alone: plenty of research has shown that you can do concrete things to improve a business partnership. Partners should start by rigorously evaluating their own behavior to ensure a good work atmosphere. One way to do so is to use the DiSC behavior assessment test. This test places individuals in one of 15 specific profiles, based on four broad categories: dominant, influencing, steady and conscientious. Such tests are a great and easy way of understanding how you and your partner differ in terms of working style. And while style describes how a person operates, her values explain why she behaves that way. This is why discussing personal values is also crucial to building a trusting relationship. Values are the beliefs, interests and intentions that motivate people on a deeper level. And not knowing what’s actually motivating someone can jeopardize trust. Consider the story of Nick and Frank, two partners in a Florida marina. One of the most difficult moments in their business relationship came about when a client sued for damages to his yacht. When the client’s lawyer called offering a deal, Frank agreed to the terms and Nick told the lawyer they would accept the offer. The next day, Frank changed his mind and wanted a fight in court. Although Nick and Frank had butted heads before, this was the first time Nick felt betrayed, as he was forced to break his word. Eventually, the partnership came to an end. Nick bought Frank out and the two men went their separate ways. Being open and honest isn’t easy. But you still have to strive to be open and honest! This is especially true if you’re in a business partnership. It’s crucial to talk openly about expectations with your partner to avoid disappointment down the line. Consider that an Inc. magazine poll revealed that the majority of people who don’t believe business partnerships are effective blame “unmet expectations.” It’s absolutely true that a partnership needs to be fair. Otherwise, the imbalance will stir up resentment and other kinds of negativity that will damage the business relationship. To that end, monetary rewards aren’t the only issue to consider. So are perks like fancy event invitations and schedule flexibility. Of course, in some cases, partner contributions may not even be comparable, which is why it’s not important how “fair” the arrangement is, objectively speaking. What really matters is how the partners perceive themselves and each other. Jerry Greenfield realized this one night when he and Ben first started Ben & Jerry’s Ice Cream. While breaking up Oreo cookies in his ice cream machine, Jerry’s fingers started to get frostbite. And with this, he felt underappreciated considering the health risks he was taking for the business. But then, the sun started rising. And Jerry remembered that Ben would start delivering ice cream at dawn, essentially risking his own life as he drove their ancient delivery truck with its faulty brakes up and down the steep hills of Vermont. Jerry realized that although both partners were contributing in very different ways, they were each doing as much as they possibly could to make their business succeed. So we’ve covered nearly everything you need to know about a business partnership. But what happens when things go wrong? Read on to learn about damage control. No matter how many honest discussions you have with your partner, you can’t plan for everything. And yet, you can and should do just that: prepare for the unexpected. An unexpected event is pretty much the definition of a crisis. If you had expected it, you would have prepared an adequate response. So in a sense, it’s impossible to plan for every single event that could challenge your enterprise. Still, it does help to imagine different scenarios and work through them with your partner. This exercise will help you get a sense of how a crisis can emerge and figure out which steps may be necessary to resolve it. For example, partners can make a list of different events that might compromise the business. Then, you both can come up with different tactics to address each crisis. Basically, this exercise ensures that partners discuss conflict resolution while they’re still calm and talking to each other. And that’s why one major crisis you should discuss ahead of time is how you will clear the air if something goes wrong in the relationship. To this end, consider a three-step conflict-resolution system. The steps are straightforward. First, you start with negotiations. If that doesn’t work, you move on to mediation with mutually agreed-upon mediators. And if all else fails, seek out arbitration. By agreeing on a system, partners won’t have to bring in the expensive lawyers to break the ice. The key message in this book: When business partnerships work, they are an inspiration; but when they don’t, they’re a curse. And that’s why you need to discuss and agree upon every aspect of your partnership before starting your enterprise. Creating your own partnership charter will save you future anger and disappointment!  Actionable advice: Create a partnership manual. This is your opportunity to develop agreements to ensure a good working atmosphere. Mention anything your partner should consider when working with you. If there are any reactions to avoid or promises to make, this is the place to discuss them in detail. Suggested further reading: The Reciprocity Advantage by Bob Johansen and Karl Ronn Big changes are coming to the way we live and do business. The Reciprocity Advantage describes the global trends that will disrupt current business partnership models, and explains how you can build advantageous collaborations that’ll stand the test of time.

Wrong! You don’t need an MBA or a winning lottery ticket to start a successful business or improve the one you’ve got. You just need some common sense and a few basic guidelines. For example, every good businessperson knows how to negotiate, but you don’t need a whole semester to learn the key to good negotiation (Just check out blink seven). And that’s just one of the tips that’s helped The Personal MBA become the go-to book for anyone interested in business. In these blinks, you’ll learn why an MBA is a big fat waste of time and money; how to confirm if your business idea is any good; and how borrowing money can actually increase your profits. Want to go into business, but have no idea where to start? Business school seems like a tempting prospect, a place where all the knowledge and contacts you need are simply handed to you – but is it really your ticket to success? It has to be, right? Otherwise why else would people pay so much for their MBA? Business school is expensive, that’s for sure – the top 15 MBA programs charge up to $53,208 per year for tuition. That’s not even including fees, loan interest or living expenses! What if we factor those into the equation, plus the opportunity cost of lost wages too? Turns out there are eight different US business schools where the cost of an MBA exceeds $300,000. “Wait,” you might think, “surely not all business schools are that pricey!” True, however, any student who holds an MBA has an average debt of $41,687 (again, without accounting for additional expenses). OK, so business school costs a lot. Is this what the educational experience is worth? Short answer: nope. In the long term, an MBA does nothing for your career. If it did, a master of business administration degree should correlate with measures of success, like an increased salary, or promotions to higher level positions. And it doesn’t. Researchers from Stanford University and the University of Washington conducted an extensive study into the matter. Analyzing 40 years’ worth of data, they found that there is no correlation between long-term career success and possessing an MBA, whether you graduated with flying colors or just scraped a passing grade. So if business school can’t make your entrepreneurial career blossom, what can? Well, you can learn a lot from experience, and from your own research online – or from books like this one. Now that you know not to waste your money on an MBA, let’s get down to business – your business. What kind of company should you start? You might think that since the IT industry is booming right now, starting an IT business would be a smart idea. But what if you absolutely despise IT as a field? Here’s a fact that more people should know: your business won’t thrive if you do it for money alone. Even if it’ll run itself eventually, your business will still need hundreds of work hours and generous amounts of money to set up. For example, in order to afford to hire people to deal with mundane tasks like payroll and HR, you’ll need to work incredibly hard for a few years. If you’re only in it for the money, can you see yourself persevering until your company reaches that point? Probably not! But if you start a business in a field that you like, not only will you be more likely to stick with it, you’ll also be ahead on the decision-making front. If you know a certain amount about the specific market you’re entering, you’ll be able to make sound decisions, develop an attractive product and tackle the competition. Say you’re into team sports. This may put you in a better position to judge which products meet the needs of sportsmen, making for a better line of business to focus on – even if there’s more demand for IT products. On the other hand, you might feel so passionate about an idea that it impedes your judgment. Imagine a small town, where expressionist art exhibitions are understandably in no high demand. When you’re an expressionist art lover, you may be oblivious to this lack of interest and try to found a museum of Expressionism right there. Sure, this could be a highly rewarding experience, but by no stretch is it a promising business idea – a painful truth that an enthusiastic art lover might be reluctant to acknowledge. But let’s say you’re not an oblivious expressionist art fan, or a grudging IT entrepreneur. Let’s say you’ve found just the right mind-set to start your own business. The next question is – how do you actually enter the market? Underneath that there’s another question: is there a shortcut to getting all the money you need? Read on in the following blinks to find out. So you’ve found a great new business opportunity, but you’re short on the cash you need to pursue it. Should you just stop right there? No way. Instead, leverage your investment. What is leverage? Simply put, it’s any technique that amplifies investor profits or losses. Typically, it’s the strategy of using borrowed money to increase your profit potential. In this way, you can make enormous gains with very little of your own capital. Let’s say you want to make a big investment that you couldn’t afford without borrowing money: you want to buy four properties at $100,000 each, but only have $20,000 of your own capital. If you borrow $380,000 and the properties double in value, you’ll have made $400,000 with just $20,000 of your own capital. That’s a 20-times return on your investment! But if the idea that borrowing more always means earning more seems a little too good to be true, well, you’re right. Leverage can be risky because it also amplifies your losses.  Let’s return to our example: imagine that the properties you bought lost half their value – your losses would amount to $200,000. That’s right, you’d lose ten times your own capital resources. For a real life example of this, you need only look to the catastrophic recession of 2008, which was caused in part by the enormous amount of leverage used by investment banks, who were caught with catastrophic losses when the property bubble popped. The lesson? Leverage can be great, but you’ve got to watch out. Many think that for a product to sell, it just has to be good – not true. Consider this: People will only want something if it fulfills their needs. Let’s put it this way – a vampire won’t pay to use your state-of-the-art solarium (unless you’ve allowed him to use it to trap unsuspecting customers!) All our decisions are influenced by our basic needs, including our buying decisions. Imagine selling a bottle of stale water to a hiker lost in a desert. He’d be willing to pay just about anything for that lousy bottle, just because it responds to his predominant need. The lesson here? Find your own desperate hiker. Any successful business fulfills one or more of its customers’ needs, and Harvard professors Nitin Nohria and Paul Lawrence asserted that there are four needs or drives that are common to all humans. The first of these is the desire to acquire and collect things, whether it’s stamps, shares or social status. Retailers and investment brokerages are the businesses that cater to this. Secondly, we have the drive to bond with other people, so we can feel valued and loved. Businesses such as dating services and companies that promise to make us more desirable (perfumeries, beauty salons) are the ones that meet this drive. Thirdly, we want to learn and satisfy our curiosity. Why else would you be reading these blinks right now? It goes without saying that Blinkist is one of the services that fulfills that need. Finally, we strive to defend ourselves, our loved ones and our property, which is where security firms and companies selling alarms come in. Consider your business idea in the light of each of these drives. Which of these four drives could your business cater to? Say your product meets not just one, but three of your customers’ basic needs. It’s ready to deliver! Now, where are all those clients who should be drooling over it? Well, you’ll need to get their attention first. But in this age of social media and information overload, this is no easy task. If you want customers to pay attention, you’ll need to offer something remarkable and memorable. And if we want to do this, we’ve got to think about the way we deliver our message to clients – the medium matters. For example, if the form of your message makes a customer think it’s made just for her, you’re far more likely to get her attention. Show your customer that you’ve made the extra effort, even if it’s just with a hand-addressed FedEx envelope. Sure, this can be expensive, but it’s worthwhile to inform selected prospective clients in a high-quality way – certainly better than spamming an entire town’s inboxes with irritating emails. If you want to market your product effectively, there’s another crucial aspect you should consider: the product’s end result. Think about it: people don’t buy a product for its own sake. They buy it because of the end result they’re hoping to attain. For example, a woman won’t pay $20 for a lipstick simply because the color is nice. She buys it because she hopes it will make her more desirable. A great way to highlight your product’s end result is through testimonials, in a statement made by an ordinary person who overcame adversity, all thanks to your product. Say you’re selling an acne cream – your testimonial could be from a pimply teenager who thought he was doomed to be an outcast until your product cleared his skin right up. That’s the sort of story that’s going to draw your customers in. Picture this: you’re visiting a pet store and see a puppy that you’re absolutely smitten with. But you’re unsure whether you want to buy it. The owner makes an offer to you to take the dog home for a week and guess what? It works its charms and you can’t imagine returning it once the week is over. This is an example of how a sales expert can convince a reluctant prospect to become a customer. But how, exactly? You can increase sales if you account for your clients’ fears. We all hate to make a bad choice, and this makes us cautious customers. Instead of buying the wrong thing, we’d rather buy nothing at all – right? In sales theory, this is called a major barrier to purchase. Naturally, it’s something salespersons hate. To encourage prospects to buy something, salespersons shoulder the risk of a bad transaction – by allowing the customer to return that cute puppy if things don’t work out. This strategy works for non-adorable items, too. For example, it’s often possible to try out a bed for an entire year, and return it for a full refund. This makes people more likely to purchase a bed. So if you can find out why your customers might say no, you’ll be able to talk them into a “yes.” In sales, reasons for saying no are called standard objections, and there are several of these. A customer might fear the product costs too much, or it won’t provide the promised benefits, or that he doesn’t need the product yet, and so on. If you know why your client won’t buy, you can devise an argumentative strategy and basically convince him that he’s dead wrong. Say he thinks his old laptop will have to do for a while longer. You can convince him that his old laptop is incompatible with essential new software. How do you picture a negotiation? You might see yourself sitting at a conference table and discussing a deal, but don’t get ahead of yourself! This is just the last phase of a negotiation. A good negotiation actually occurs in several stages. The first part of negotiation is setting the stage. Long before you start exchanging offers with your business partners, you can optimize your outlook in the early decisions you make. You could make sure you’re negotiating with the right person, for example: did the company send someone with real decision-making authority? Or just someone who’s been assigned to collect information for those in power? You can also create a conducive environment by choosing the setting you’re most convincing in. Will you present your offer in person, over the phone or should you organize an online meeting? An elegant office could make a great impression, but maybe your voice is a lot more confident over the phone. If you’re having trouble deciding, research data in your industry or market may prove very helpful. Once you’ve prepared, decide on the terms of your proposal. Consider how attractive your offers will be to the other party, and in every case, search for ways to make the offer even more desirable. You could even try to find out the other party’s offers. Then you can work out a way to make yours seem superior. You’ve always got to consider the worst-case scenario, so anticipate possible objections and create an argumentative strategy to defuse or counter them. And, in case they don’t work, decide on the concessions and compromises that you’re willing to accept. The final stage of negotiation is the actual discussion. Because of the effort you put in during the first two stages, you’ll be far better prepared. In fact, most of the hard work at this point is already over! Ever had a plan that seemed great until you tried to put it into action? Some bosses have great schemes they just can’t implement. Are they unlucky with their employees? Or is it possible they just don’t know how to communicate with them? Here’s what they don’t know: If you want others to do something, you should tell them why you want them to do it. Harvard psychologist Ellen Langer demonstrated this in a study where her students asked others queuing in front of a Xerox to let them go first. 60 percent of the people agreed, but when a reason for the request was provided, an impressive 95 percent complied. Moreover, if you tell people about your intentions, everyone can work in ways that support that plan, and know what to do if the situation changes. This way, you won’t have to micromanage every step. Imagine a general telling his field commander to capture a hill, but the situation changes and capturing the hill becomes strategically futile – the field commander will know how to react if he knows the larger goal is to flank the enemy. There’s another way to boost your communication, and it’s very simple: stop putting others down. Yet it’s surprising how often we find ourselves dismissing our coworkers’ comments. It might make you feel superior but it gets you nowhere, causing your partner to withdraw from the conversation, even if you don’t notice it. People can also become defensive and try to save face rather than understand your comments. Think about it: how engaged and cooperative would you be in a conversation with your boss after he said: “This is the silliest idea I’ve ever heard of.” By contrast, effective communication sees both partners actively and comfortably exchanging ideas in a dialogue that could strengthen the entire organization. Sure, it’s no fun to be unproductive, but being too busy can harm you and your work too. The best way to be productive is, in fact, through setting limits. If you have several things to do at once, your performance can be reduced across all of them. Your brain can only handle so much. Think of it like juggling: the more balls you’re trying to juggle at once, the more likely you are to drop them all. Moreover, with every task come unexpected demands that take extra time and effort to deal with. If your schedule doesn’t allow for extra time, you won’t be able to cope with those demands, especially if they’re coming from several tasks at once. So how can we stay in tune with what we can handle? Your best bet is to listen to the natural fluctuations of your energy. We’re not talking about a far-fetched, new age concept here – it’s simply that your productivity isn’t distributed evenly throughout the day. Instead, your body has a natural rhythm. Sometimes you can feel highly alert and productive. At other times, you’re far too tired to get anything done at all. Though it varies from person to person, most people are more productive in the morning than around noon. We also know that energy cycles in 90-minute-spans. So within that one-and-a-half-hour frame your energy will both rise and fall. If you’re aware of these natural fluctuations, you can take advantage of the times when you feel energized. And more importantly, you can recognize when you’re crashing and take a well-needed break. The key message in this book: If you want a thriving business, your product should cater to the core needs of your customers. By communicating confidently and cleverly, you can convince your clients to buy, your employees to cooperate and your business partners to sign your deal.  Actionable advice: Actions speak louder than words.  The next time you have to hire a new employee, don’t go for the applicants who performed best in an interview. Instead, do some extra research and find out how an applicant has performed in past months or years. Past performance is the best predictor of future performance.

If you expect it to reveal anything close to a 50/50 split between men and women in top positions, think again! Currently, women hold only 5.2 percent of Fortune 500 CEO positions. If you see this statistic as something that just has to change, you’re not alone.  These blinks  offer valuable insights into the politics of promotion, a particularly useful tool for women. They’ll provide essential pointers on the importance of knowing and understanding the internal politics and culture of your organization, and not least on how to proceed in order to get the promotion you so badly want. In these blinks, you’ll discover why performing well is not the only thing you need to do in order to get promoted; why being excluded from Monday night’s ballgame has a negative bearing on your career advancement; and why power in certain contexts is better than likability. You perform well at work. Your projects all receive high praise from your boss. Yet, when your next promotion opportunity comes along, you’re left empty handed. Why?  Workplaces are highly political environments, not meritocracies. Advancement in the business world requires not only skill and competence, but also political savvy. Politically savvy people know how to subtly work the system. They are conscious of their surroundings, and can easily identify which stakeholders and relationships are important for their success, using this knowledge strategically in order to get ahead. It all starts with building good relationships with those in power, that is, the ones who have influence over the decisions that will affect your career trajectory. Without this political savvy, you can deliver great results time and time again and still be passed over for promotion. It could be that your colleague, who, despite being less competent, still got the promotion you think you deserved, simply bonded with the people who had influence over the decision of who to promote. The need to bond with important stakeholders is clear enough. But that’s easier said than done for women in the workplace, as company culture and politics today are still biased against them. Even if a company has made it clear in its guidelines that all employees are to be treated equally, women still face challenges when it comes to building workplace relationships. For example, a woman in a team mostly comprising men probably won’t get invited to weekend fishing trips or Monday night ball games. It won’t necessarily be out of malice, but simply because she is a woman, and her colleagues assume that she wouldn’t be interested in these activities or wouldn’t fit in.  But if she’s excluded from theses outings, she’s also excluded from the important conversations and bonding opportunities that come with them. As a woman, you have to be creative in forging bonds with the men in these networks, even though they might not make an effort to do the same. Picture that colleague of yours who is always talking about his achievements at work, and you can’t help but feel that he’s bragging. But is he really? Or is he preparing his promotion by promoting himself?  Performance in the workplace doesn’t speak for itself. Not everyone sees or has the context to understand your work, so you need to actively cultivate your reputation across an organization by talking about it. If you assume that performance speaks for itself, then the chances of career stagnation increase. In fact, research shows that women who know how to talk about their accomplishments and achievements receive both more promotions and higher compensation. In contrast, those who keep it to themselves are more likely to get neither.  Imagine that your company finally closes a massive deal after seemingly endless negotiations with another company. These hard-fought negotiations were brought to a close thanks to your convincing argumentation. After the meeting, what should you do? You should make sure to meet with your boss and tell them about the successful negotiations! Don’t just assume that they know a deal was made, and that it was your savvy that finally made it happen. But sometimes your contributions aren’t so cut and dry. In order to be able to promote yourself, you also need to be aware of your value proposition, in other words, the ways in which your work contributes to positive business outcomes. It’s important to know your value proposition, because you can only really promote yourself once you know what you bring to the table. To figure out your value proposition, write down some situations at work in which you were recently involved. Next, ask yourself how you specifically contributed to the success of these situations. This will give you insight into the skills and competencies that you can promote as part of your reputation. Most people believe the path to promotion involves keeping your head down and powering through your tasks – but this is absolutely incorrect. Rather, promotion depends on keeping your head up and looking around your company. The first step toward promotion is understanding how decisions are made and detecting the hidden rules that influence the decision-making process. Decisions in organizations are almost never made by a single person, but instead by many people. You need to find out which people have the most influence on the decisions that affect you – like promotions – and build good relationships with them. One way to figure this out is through simple observation. Ask yourself questions like who the management consults with before making important decisions. You should also be aware of unspoken rules. Though your organization’s official policy might be to “hire and promote the best people for the job,” it’s likely that there are other rules, such as tenure, that affect your promotion. So don’t worry if you aren’t promoted right away. Just develop an awareness of these informal rules in order to understand the organization and your position in it. But hidden rules go beyond the promotion process. There are also unspoken rules in the company culture – the personality of your company that defines the codes of behavior that are accepted, rewarded or viewed as favorable.  If you want your career at a particular company to prosper, you have to behave in accordance with their company culture. This will vary greatly depending on where you work. Company A, for instance, might have an unspoken rule that the one who barks the loudest gets to speak. In this environment, you have to interrupt others to make your point and thrive. This same strategy might not work for company B, where patience and listening are more highly valued. At this point, you’ve learned some of the things that you can do immediately to start preparing for promotion. The final blinks will examine the kinds of people that can help you along the way. Imagine that your colleague just got promoted to a position that you didn’t even know was vacant. How did that happen? In all likelihood, her network provided her with the right information at the right time.  You can do the same by building a strategic network, a group of people who support, protect and promote you. Your strategic network doesn’t just help you get promoted. It also provides you with valuable information about the workplace, the people in it and its hidden rules.  For example, if you are applying to a new position, take some time before your interview to consult a trusted colleague within your strategic network about the hiring manager and their decision-making process. This way, you’ll have a better idea of who to talk to and how to best leverage your value proposition. In order to build an effective strategic network, you first have to define your career goals. After all, without these goals, how will you know who can help you achieve them? These goals should be divided into short-term and long-term career goals. Knowing these goals, you can better analyze the position you want to achieve, as well as the people who might help you get there. One way to keep track of who can help you, and where, is to list all your important professional relationships on a track sheet, evaluate their level of influence and the quality of your current relationship to them. Imagine, for instance, that you currently occupy an entry-level position in your company’s marketing department. Your goal, however, is to become a team leader in the sales department. To reach this goal, start by identifying who the current team leader in the sales department reports to, who the decision makers in the hiring process are and which members of the sales team can support you in the hiring process. Connect with all of them, and you’ll be on the right track! Imagine that you’re looking for a new job. But, instead of making endless phone calls and writing your applications yourself, someone else tells you all about positions that aren’t even listed yet, and then goes ahead and recommends you for them. Sounds like a dream, right?  It’s not a dream. In fact, if you find the right sponsor, this could be your reality. A sponsor is someone from within your organization – an influential person who is higher up on the ladder than you currently are and who wants to see you succeed. Sponsors are different from mentors in that they help you on multiple levels: not only do they offer you their sage advice, they also actively make things happen for you. If your goal is to hold a top position in the marketing department, your mentor might advise you to build a relationship with the marketing manager. Your sponsor would do the same, but would then actually introduce you to said marketing manager. So how do you go about finding the right sponsor? That depends on you and your career goals, but one thing’s for certain: the right sponsor might not be the one you like the most, but rather the one with the most power. For instance, while you might admire a top-level manager for their inclusive leadership, their decisions are always undermined by those who push decisions through without worrying about inclusion. This inclusive manager might be likeable, but he has less power, and thus less value for you as a sponsor. Instead, consider other contacts with a greater level of influence, and make dedicated time in your schedule to bond with them. But why would anyone be interested in being your sponsor? Well, sponsorship is always mutually beneficial if it’s done right. By helping you, your sponsor can expand her impact and reach across the organization. We all need help and guidance sometimes. And just like a personal trainer raises your chances of reaching your health and fitness goals, a professional coach can help you reach your career aspirations. As you learned previously, knowing and setting goals is critical for your career development. Your coach can not only help you to define these goals, but can also provide you with the strategic focus necessary to achieve them, along with the accountability necessary to keep you on the right track. Imagine that your goal is to become a manager. As you now know, reaching that goal is dependent upon your ability to create or improve your strategic network. After meeting with your coach and discussing your goal, you decide that the best approach is to spend an hour each week networking with important people in your organization. As time goes by, however, you become overwhelmed by your day-to-day work and stop networking. Here, your coach steps in, holds you accountable for straying from your plan and encourages you to keep networking! Finally, your coach can teach you important skills that will help you climb the career ladder. For example, once you’ve landed a leadership position, you might realize that your leadership skills are lacking; you don’t know how to trust your subordinates to complete tasks as well as you could. You know that if you don’t let go, you’ll be overwhelmed by tasks that your subordinates should be doing anyway and demoralize them in the process. Luckily, your coach can teach you the leadership skills that will allow you to trust your team and let go of the desire to control everything. The key message in this book: Women face more obstacles than men in the workplace, and overcoming these obstacles isn’t as easy as just doing a better job. Rather, women need to be politically savvy by understanding workplace dynamics, and identifying the people who can help and support them in reaching their career goals.  Actionable advice: Always ask yourself: How can I add extra value to my work? Your value isn’t just your ability to complete tasks. It’s also the knowledge and attitude you bring to the workplace. By taking the time to do things like sharing interesting articles on topics that are relevant and important for your company or department, you add extra value and people notice that you care and contribute.

But, despite this bandying about, its meaning is often unclear. Sometimes it denotes something sinister and Machiavellian; sometimes, something enviable and awe-inspiring. It’s true that power can corrupt even the best of us – but this shouldn’t make us denounce or shun it. Power can and should be a force for good. To attain it, we must act compassionately and selflessly toward our peers – otherwise they won’t follow our influence – and we mustn’t let our power go to our head, for then we lose the ability to empathize with others. Once this ability is lost, we run the risk of losing our power and thus the ability to make others’ lives better. These blinks will help you understand the nature of power and how to use it for the good of all. In these blinks, you’ll also learn how cancer patients empower themselves via storytelling; why writing down what you’re grateful for is important for self-empowerment; and how NBA players use the power of encouragement to raise their teams to new heights. What does it mean to have power? Is it an elusive thing that only belongs to presidents, politicians and celebrities? The truth is, power is used by everyday people in ordinary interactions – in motivating an employee to do a good job, for instance, or getting your children to eat their vegetables and do their homework. Whenever someone uses influence to make a difference in the world, that’s large-scale power in action. The exploits of Thomas Clarkson are a great example of power in action. In 1785, Clarkson was a student at Cambridge University when he won a writing contest with an essay that detailed the horrors of the slave trade. At the time, most European economies relied heavily on the brutal slave trade, and millions were forcibly transported for their labor. Clarkson’s prize-winning essay was just the start. He was soon writing more pamphlets and letters on the subject and was convincing many people to boycott the sugar being harvested by slaves in British territories. Eventually, these protests were powerful enough that Great Britain’s Parliament outlawed slavery. Clarkson used power to achieve a huge change, but power also exists within relationships and everyday interactions. For example, the power dynamic between two siblings can also change a person’s life. During adolescence, an older sibling will often be stronger and smarter, with more education; in short, they have power over their younger sibling. Enjoying this power in early life often pushes older siblings to seek out positions power as they grow older, it also leads them to be generally more traditional and conservative in outlook. On the other hand, younger siblings, who lack this experience of power, will become more cooperative and innovative as adults. Because power is so ubiquitous, scientists have long studied how it is used. In one study, known as “leaderless group discussion paradigm” experiment psychologists looked into the power dynamics of everyday life. The experiment involved the observation of a group of strangers who were asked to cooperate on solving a problem without any assigned roles or guidance being offered. Fascinatingly, the researchers found that some participants naturally assumed power by being the first to offer their opinions or by encouraging others. There are a lot of opinions on social media these days, but the multitude of Instagram users are all actually rather similar: each is eager to win a good reputation and gain influence within their social circle. And how can they gain this influence? Research shows that influence is determined by a person’s ability to improve the lives of others. The author made this discovery 20 years ago, when conducting an experiment at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. Students were asked to fill out a survey that rated how much influence, or power, other students had over them. These surveys were filled out a second time after four months, and a third time after nine months. The students were also asked to rate their own levels of enthusiasm, kindness, focus, calmness and openness – categories that are known as “the Big Five Social Tendencies.” The data revealed that the ability to show enthusiasm and express kindness toward others were the biggest factors in determining someone’s influence and social power. In other words, those who benefit their peers are rewarded with power. It’s not all that different in the Arctic, where Inuit tribes bestow respect and power on those who share food. Meat, in particular, brings the biggest benefits, and men who provide the most food have the best chance of landing a mate. For women, generosity to their peers results in help with childcare. In all these situations, research shows that those who hold the group back by not helping have less power. Research at an east-coast college followed a team of rowers. The team member with the least amount of influence was, unsurprisingly, the one team member who was frequently late to training and performed poorly. In the next blink, we’ll look at how people with power manage the tricky business of holding on to it. As Peter Parker learned when he became Spider-Man, great power comes with great responsibility. Indeed, though it’s difficult to gain influence and power, it’s awfully easy to lose them. That is, unless you take the following advice to heart. Continuing to be generous and encouraging with others is the first key to maintaining power. In 2008, the author and his UC Berkeley research team spent seven months observing NBA players. In that time, they identified 25 different kinds of encouraging gestures involving physical contact, including high fives, chest bumps and embraces. Statistics show that the more these physical gestures were used on a teammate, the more appreciated and empowered that teammate would feel, thus improving his performance and making him happy to support the teammate who’d initiated the gesture. Other ways to maintain power are to use gratitude and tell stories that bring people together. In a 2003 study, participants were asked to record five things that made them feel grateful, every day, for nine weeks. Afterward, the results showed that the most grateful participants were also the healthiest with the least amount of stress. These participants also had the best social standing, with high levels of influence and power. Research conducted over several decades examined participants experiencing trauma, such as students with severe stress during exams, couples going through divorce and patients diagnosed with life-threatening disease. Remarkably, participants who used storytelling skills to describe their intense experiences with great detail saw a reduction in stress and sadness. The grades of the students improved and T-cell levels of cancer patients increased. Meanwhile, those who expressed themselves in flat, emotionless stories remained the same. The results suggest that the participants who told captivating stories engaged the interest of others, which tightened the social bond between them and their listeners, thus reducing the overall stress of the social group. In the next blink, we’ll have a look at the negative aspects of power. What kind of people come to mind when you think of the corrupting effects of power? Politicians, perhaps? Or greedy bankers? Well, the truth is, all of us are susceptible to the dangers of power. In particular, power can reduce our empathy and encourage our self-serving nature. One study asked participants to recall times when they felt powerful or powerless; as they were reliving these moments of increased or reduced power, they were shown a video of someone’s hand squeezing a rubber ball. Those who were experiencing powerlessness were shown to be more likely to mimic the squeezing of the ball, while those who were feeling powerful showed no evidence of this mimicry. The researchers believe that the powerless were empathizing as a way to create sympathy and trust. The powerful, on the other hand, simply didn’t need to be empathetic. In another study conducted by a Dutch company, 1,275 participants filled out surveys that asked them to mark their position within their organization on a scale of 1 to 100, with 100 being the company’s president or CEO. They were then asked if they’d ever had a sexual affair or considered cheating on their partner. Results showed that 26.3 percent of the participants admitted to cheating, and a majority of these people marked their position of power as high. As well as being more self-serving, those with power will sometimes rationalize their disrespectful behavior with questionable excuses. During a study, the author displayed a graph charting the past 30 years of average US family incomes. He then asked participants to offer their opinion on why the wealth has been unevenly distributed to the top 10 percent. Upper-class participants believed the top ten percent gained their wealth through ability, intelligence and hard work. The poorer participants, in contrast, believed the top ten percent had enjoyed privileged access to resources like quality education and the stability afforded by growing up in an affluent neighborhood. When it comes to social injustice, the wealthy have ways of rationalizing their situation to feel less guilt. There’s a good chance that, at one point or another, you’ve felt stressed out about having to give a presentation. But did you know this is due to powerlessness? During the Trier Social Stress Task (TSST), participants were asked to give a speech on difficult topics such as euthanasia, with only ten minutes of preparation time. Data shows that an audience of strangers in a situation like this, with their ability to bestow either approval or disapproval, will take on the role of power. As a result, participants instinctively respond with a fight-or-flight reaction: heart rate, blood pressure and stress levels skyrocket, and the immune system crashes. Unfortunately, the stress that comes from a position of powerlessness is experienced daily by the disadvantaged in society. It’s clear why: Police, occupying a traditional role of power, have been shown to be more likely to search and physically abuse African-American and Latino men in random traffic stops. Meanwhile, African-Americans have fewer housing options and receive more severe sentencing by the courts. Furthermore, it’s been shown that employers are more harshly critical of resumes from African-American job applicants. Naturally, all of this powerlessness gives rise to aggression, stress and ill health. Neuroscientists have conducted long-term studies that revealed the physiological effects of powerlessness. When children of low-income families reach 11 years of age, their brains were five percent less developed in areas related to language, rationality and stress control. The researchers noted the negative impact this would have on learning, coping with threats or challenges and making significant contributions to society. This study concluded that those raised in low-income families are likelier to have stress-related cardiovascular disorders and are also at a 20- to 40-percent higher risk of dying from common diseases. The issues surrounding the powerful and powerless aren’t limited to courtrooms and boardrooms. Understanding the extent of these dynamics can help us battle racism, sexism, homophobia and other inequalities in our society. The key message in this book: Regardless of our differences, we must learn to respect one another wholeheartedly.

Bazerman","summary":"What do the Challenger disaster, Hurricane Katrina and the British Petroleum oil spill have in common? These terrible disasters all resulted partly because key people failed to notice important details that could have prevented the tragedies in the first place. We're unknowingly blind to all sorts of information, even when right before our eyes. It's crucial not to miss the important details, especially if you want to be a successful leader. In these blinks, you'll learn why it is so easy to overlook things, and to realize the damage that can be caused when we fail to notice key details. You'll learn how to hone your noticing skills and better understand why noticing is such a valuable skill to cultivate. In the following blinks, you’ll also discover: why professional baseball coaches didn’t notice players’ flagrant use of steroids; why the CEO of British Petroleum lost his job over just one sentence; and why Sears inadvertently encouraged employees to scam its automotive customers. Horses in busy cities often wear blinders – small shields positioned so that the horse can’t see to the right or left, only straight ahead. This way, the horse can ignore the traffic and people, focusing only on what’s in front of it on the road. People too can wear virtual “blinders.” We fail to notice the simple things around us as we focus intently on just one thing. In the 1970s, psychologist Ulric Neisser illustrated this phenomenon in a video. A short clip, only nineteen seconds in length, shows people wearing either black or white shirts passing a basketball back and forth. As you watch the clip, you are supposed to count how many passes those wearing white shirts make. Most people are able to focus and count the passes accurately. If you ask a viewer if anything strange happened in the video, however, most viewers would say no. But something strange does happen. As the players pass the ball, a woman dressed in black and holding an umbrella walks through the scene. Most viewers don't recall this as they are too focused on counting passes. When we focus too much on one thing, like counting passes, we can become blind to other things that might be right in front of us. This is called inattentional blindness. Yet it is possible to overcome inattentional blindness. We have to learn to notice. The power of noticing means being able to see that woman with the umbrella. It means being able to focus on something without going blind to everything else. In the following blinks, you'll see how your ability to notice can prevent you from making careless mistakes and enable you to become a successful leader. So you missed the woman with the umbrella in the video – a harmless omission. Yet missing important details in other situations can have much more serious consequences. The 1986 Challenger disaster in the United States is one tragic example. Prior to the launch of the space shuttle, many NASA engineers expressed concerns, worrying that the temperature on the day of the launch might play a role in its chances of success. Engineers ran some simulations and found that seven out of 24 of their tests were unsuccessful. This 7:24 chance of failure became NASA's main area of focus. Some engineers felt the risk was too high, while others were confident that the risk was minimal. In the end, the launch went forward, despite lingering concerns. The Challenger exploded, resulting in the death of all seven crew members and one of the biggest catastrophes in aerospace history. Even with the odds of success at 17:24, the mission still failed. Yet the disaster could have been prevented had engineers noticed a crucial detail that was right in front of them. They focused so much on the seven simulations that failed that they didn't pay attention to the temperature conditions of those that succeeded. If they had, they would've noticed a crucial detail: all of the successful simulations were carried out when the temperature was above 65 degrees Fahrenheit. On the day Challenger launched, it was much colder, at 40 degrees Fahrenheit. If they had focused less on failed tests and more on the successful tests, engineers would have had a clearer picture. As in fact, there wasn’t an approximately 30 percent chance of failure on the day Challenger launched – it was actually closer to 99 percent. The blindness that led to the Challenger disaster was caused by paying too much attention to the wrong details. Unfortunately, this isn't the only sort of blindness from which we can suffer. What would you do if you saw your boss stealing office supplies from work? Would you confront or report her? Or perhaps do nothing at all? More often than not, you might not do anything. And you’re not alone. We make ourselves blind to events or details when it is in our benefit to do so. Think about it: reporting on your boss is serious business. It's difficult to remain unbiased in a situation where your own interests may be involved. This sort of situation is called motivational blindness. Sports offers many examples of motivational blindness. Players will inevitably view an opposing team as more aggressive; you’ll notice an opponent's fouls more often, for example, but view your own team's infractions as less severe. As fans, It’s almost impossible for us to watch a game objectively, as we’re too motivated by our desire to see our team win. Even worse, we can become blind to bad behavior when focusing on a larger goal. This was the case with steroid use in Major League Baseball in the United States, from 1998 to 2001. At the time, one had to be truly blind to not know players were dabbling in performance-enhancing drugs. From 1991 to 1994, the home-run average for the top sluggers was 44. In 1998, this average was beaten by a total of ten professional players. In 1999, eight players beat the new record. In 2000, six players came out on top; in 2001, another nine broke the record, again. This startling trend should've clearly indicated that something was amiss, but managers and coaches turned a blind eye. They were so focused on winning that they didn't care how their players were increasing their skills, even if doping was both illegal and dangerous. A key step to becoming an effective leader is learning how to avoid motivational blindness. It’s not just about self-interest; you can also be blind to risks you're taking. As we’ve seen with baseball managers, if you’re winning, it’s easy to ignore the risks that may be in plain sight around you. Motivational blindness is powerful, but you can learn to curb it. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon learned a hard lesson in 2005 when he hired Ina Drew as the company’s new chief investment officer. Drew increased company profits significantly, but did so by making enormously risky trades. Dimon knew about the risks, but ignored them as profits were so high. By the time Dimon finally looked closely at Drew’s strategy, it was too late. A series of risky trades ended up costing the company $6.2 billion in just one month. How can we learn from this? Dimon himself said the biggest lesson he learned was not to get too complacent when you've got a successful track record. In other words, don't become a victim of motivational blindness. Never stop asking questions. How is your success coming about? Is it sustainable? What are the risks? A good way to check motivational bias is to set rules for yourself, a practice that auditing firms follow. Auditing firms have a high risk of motivational blindness as the more money they help companies save, the more they earn. It could thus be in their interest to turn a blind eye to false accounting or fraud. Moreover, if they keep clients happy, they get more work. To stay on the straight and narrow, auditing firms implement some simple rules. To keep auditors and clients from getting too cozy, auditors aren’t allowed to work on the same account all the time and equally, can’t be empoyed by a company they just audited before a significant period of time has elapsed. Rules like this can help us check ourselves and ensure we’re noticing the things we should. All good leaders must constantly stay alert to avoid motivational blindness and the problems it can create. What do magicians, politicians and salespeople have in common? They are the masters of misdirection. While you might expect it of a politician or a sleight-of-hand magician, a salesperson isn’t an obvious example of someone who deliberately wants to mislead. A salesperson sells items in a shop and often, we take what they say about a product at face value. But we shouldn't. A salesperson’s job is to persuade us to spend as much as possible, and in doing so they can steer us away from what we truly want or need. To avoid being misdirected, approach a situation in logical fashion. Don't let yourself be seduced; keep your cool and maintain a calm mind. Keep these steps in mind: First, remember your objectives. Say you need to buy a television. Before you get distracted by a salesperson’s rhetoric or the deep discounts on coffee machines, remind yourself: you’re there for a TV, and nothing else. Second, identify your objective’s most important criteria. Do you want a television with extra features, such as HD or WiFi? Or do you prefer a lower-priced, basic model to save cash? This will help you avoid being talked into extra features you might not want or need. Finally, analyze your options. When the salesperson starts delivering his spiel, don't get distracted. If he shows you a computer you can watch TV on, does that fit into your criteria? No – it's not a TV. How about a television chock-full of high-tech gadgets? No, if one of your criteria was affordability. If you stick to these steps, you can easily avoid being misdirected and thus avoid making decisions you might come to regret. When we look at examples of corporate meltdowns, such as with energy company Enron, we might assume that one big mistake caused the company to collapse. Yet most of the time, massive failure is the result of many small mistakes, compounded over time. It’s easy to fail to notice small changes, even when they happen right under our noses. For example, if you put a frog into a pot of boiling water, the frog will immediately jump out to save itself. However, if you put the frog in cold water and gradually heat it to its boiling point, the frog will stay put until it is dead. When the temperature change is gradual, the frog doesn’t know it’s in danger. Overconfidence can also blind us to mistakes, or encourage us to make more. Take, for example, a successful executive with a great track record. One day she realizes she’s made an accounting error. She now has two choices: report the error honestly, or make a small change to cover it up. Making a small change, in the executive’s mind, is a minor thing and perhaps even justifiable, as she’ll simply reverse it with earnings from the next period. Yet if the executive falls short in the next accounting period, she might try to manipulate the figures again. This time the small change becomes a larger change. Soon enough, what started as a small mistake has snowballed into massive fraud. Researchers Catherine Schrand and Sarah Zechman spent seven years examining companies that had been investigated for fraud. They found that in 75 percent of cases, the fraud began with optimistic or overconfident executives who manipulated figures when their optimism wasn't confirmed by real data. Tyco International, HealthSouth and Enron were all companies that were part of the researchers’ studies, and prove that turning a blind eye to small mistakes can build up to systemic failure. It’s easy to concentrate too much on what's happening or on what you are doing. Have you ever stopped to consider what's not happening, or what you're not doing? If you start paying attention to things that haven't happened, you'll be surprised at how much you can learn. In an Arthur Conan Doyle story, the famous Sherlock Holmes investigates the alleged murder of John Straker and the theft of his horse. The police believed that the suspected murderer entered the stable without disturbing Straker’s guard dog and stole the horse. The suspect then unexpectedly ran into Straker and beat him to death, before fleeing the scene. Holmes eventually concludes that it was the horse that had actually killed Straker; there was no actual murderer. He figured this out by examining what didn't happen. Why didn’t the guard dog bark? It could only be that the dog already knew the person who took the horse. A stranger couldn't have done it – only Straker could have. Paying attention to details that are missing can also help you determine whether something that seems valuable is indeed so. When you hear about a deal that sounds too good to be true, don’t give in to your first instinct and grab it – instead, pause and think about it. What might be hiding behind the hype? Be wary and keep an eye out for the catch behind the “deal of a lifetime.” Buying a used car is a good exercise in being wary. if the price is very low, and the car seems to be in perfect condition, you need to ask yourself: Why is it on sale in the first place? Why so low a price? Behind its shiny facade, the car could rusting or falling apart. Being skeptical can help you make better decisions. Always try to notice what's missing; don't focus so much on dogs that bark – notice those that don't. You're on the way to the train station via taxi when the driver tells you that there’s a train strike. He then offers to take you to your destination himself, for what he says is a good price. Do you take the taxi? Before making any decision, think ahead to what the consequences might be. British Petroleum CEO Tony Hayward learned this lesson the hard way in 2010. That year, Deepwater Horizon, a BP oil platform, suffered an explosion that killed 11 people and leaked oil into the ocean at an alarming rate for nearly three months. Huge numbers of people lost their jobs and entire communities were devastated – in short, lives were completely shattered by the disaster. Without considering how his words would sound to the victims of the tragedy, Hayward made a grave error. When speaking of the spill, he stated, “No one else wants this thing [the spill] to end more than I do. I'd like my life back.” The backlash was so great that Hayward had to leave his job. Thinking ahead can also help you know when you should trust someone. In our taxi situation, we essentially have two choices: assume the driver is lying, or trust him and take the cab. You do take a risk if you assume the driver is lying about the strike, as you might be stranded at the station if he’s right. But the issue isn't choosing between cynicism or trust. Instead of making a blind guess about the character of the driver, think about information that might help you get ahead. Try, then, to find out if the strike is real; call the station, or ask someone else. This will guide you to make the right decision. Aim to understand other people's behavior without destroying any opportunities to build trust. Discounter Wal-Mart attracts customers through its very low prices. Yet few shoppers consider the indirect results of supporting an aggressive low-cost retailer like Wal-Mart. Companies like Wal-Mart put so much pressure on their suppliers to deliver products that can be sold at hugely discounted prices that often, as just one example, safety concerns are disregarded. In the 2000s, a gas can manufacturer called Blitz USA presented a new model to Wal-Mart that could prevent flames from flowing into the gas can. Blitz was facing a number of lawsuits for this exact problem, thus the product overhaul. Yet Wal-Mart rejected the new model on the grounds that the price was too high, so Blitz redesigned it with lower safety standards, so they could sell it through Wal-Mart. So the next time you want to choose a cheaper product, ask: what corners were cut to make this product so inexpensively? Were standards compromised? Could anyone get hurt? Good leaders especially need to identify the indirect harm certain decisions might cause. A decision by US department store chain Sears in the 1990s elucidates the need to consider indirect effects. Sears management set a quota for auto repair employees to book $147 hourly in sales. Although it seemed like a straightforward, profitable idea, the quota essentially encouraged employees to sell customers unnecessary repairs and equipment just to fill their quota. Sears should have more thoroughly considered the problem of motivation with such a quota system. Instead, management thought only of money and didn't consider how the policy might push employees to cheat the system. Sometimes we fail to predict an event even when all the evidence points to it happening. Such events are called predictable surprises. Predictable surprises happen when key people are conscious of a pending disaster and understand its risks yet still don't think action is warranted. Hurricane Katrina is a classic case of a predictable surprise. In 2001, the Houston Chronicle reported that the city of New Orleans was “sinking” and that its main hurricane buffer was eroding, leaving the city vulnerable to a large storm. in 2004, the US Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) reported that a New Orleans hurricane was one of the top three potential catastrophes facing the country. They even cited that the US government would not be prepared to deal with such an event. In 2005, Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans, a “surprise” that was utterly predictable. Airport security in the United States is another example of a situation like Katrina that also resulted in disaster. Yet you can work to prevent predictable surprises by following these steps: First, recognize the threat. In the 1990s, an increased level of security breaches should have triggered warnings that airports needed to implement more thorough security checks. Second, prioritize the threat. In tandem with a rise in security breaches, the threat of armed groups to the United States during this time had also increased. Vice President Al Gore suggested creating a concrete proposal through a commission to increase security at airports to counter the threats. Finally, mobilize action. Despite the vice president's best intentions, the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) opposed the changes suggested by the commission. What’s more, US airlines spent millions of dollars to prevent the government from addressing security issues, as they feared such measures would scare away customers. On September 11, 2001, a group of hijackers ran two planes into the World Trade Center in New York City. So how do you start developing your ability to notice? Strive to be a first-class noticer. First-class noticers are less prone to being blinded by what they want to see, and more open to what the data truly suggests. They listen for the dogs that don't bark and they avoid being misdirected. They prevent predictable surprises and are highly suspicious of things that sound too good to be true. When they approach a situation where they need to make a decision, they view it as if they were an unbiased outsider. They don’t let their own interests get in the way of making the right choice. If you are a first-class noticer, you will also be a much stronger leader to those around you. Start applying what you’ve learned to your daily life. Don’t give up if at first you don’t succeed. When a first-class noticer fails, they’ll learn from their mistakes rather than quitting. Figure out what you didn’t notice and think about how to avoid making the same error in the future. Always keep striving to improve yourself and keep learning from your experiences. Use your capacity to notice to help you become the successful leader you want to be. Remember that the people you lead might not be as good at noticing as you are, so it’s important you use your skills to help others. We’re all taught that focus is extremely important, and indeed it is, but when making critical decisions, noticing is better. The key message in this book: People place a lot of emphasis on the importance of focus, but what we really need is to learn to notice. If you train yourself to be a first-class noticer, you'll be much better equipped for making important decisions, especially those that might affect others. Noticing is a necessary skill for anyone who wants to be a strong leader. Actionable advice: Don't let your hunger for success blind you. Having high expectations for yourself is important, but don’t let your goals make you fail to notice important things around you. Stick to what the data really says, not what you want it to say. Remember that most large-scale corporate disasters, like Enron, started and continued because leaders were too self-confident and lied to themselves about what was really happening at the company.

You can bring together some of the brightest minds and still have a highly dysfunctional team. As you’ll find out in the blinks ahead, what makes a truly effective team is a mixture of different qualities, chief among them the commitment to making or achieving something that can’t be done alone. We know that great things can happen when people come together and put their minds to it. In a way, modern civilization is a testament to what human cooperation is capable of. Author Jon Gordon performs a valuable service by telling us what every team leader should know, from what qualities a perfect team should have to which pitfalls can bring down even the best teams. In these blinks, you’ll learn why culture is Apple’s secret ingredient; how a vampire motivated a football team; and why it pays to study details few people will ever see. The business world is filled with challenges, starting with trying to get new ideas, organizations and products off the ground. Of course, having a great team at your service can be a huge asset, and yet keeping that team running smoothly presents its own challenges. For starters, it’s important to keep your team motivated when times are tough or when your goal looks more like a fantasy than a real possibility. This is just one example of when staying positive is crucial to staying afloat. One of the big benefits of establishing an optimistic, positive outlook within your team is that everyone benefits, with the group as a whole, as well as each individual, experiencing an increased likelihood of success. According to a report from Duke University, optimistic individuals have a greater likelihood of succeeding in politics, business and sports. The benefits of positive thinking extend beyond the workplace as well: the pioneering psychologist John Gottman found that married couples who engaged in five positive interactions for every one negative interaction were much likelier to stay together than the couples who were closer to a one-to-one ratio. And what about team leaders? Well, they also benefit from the positive workplace environment they help create – and it starts with having devoted team members. According to the research of organizational expert Wayne Baker, leaders who exude positive energy naturally attract other people. So, if you’re a leader with a vision and you project an aura of optimism and unity, people in your workplace will naturally want to be around you. As Baker explains, positive-thinking leaders will inevitably attract talented colleagues, rather than other leaders, and these people will likely devote their time willingly to your projects. It’s also likely that they’ll share new information, opportunities and ideas with you before they share them with anyone else. To put it simply: when the team is thinking positively, everyone wins. If you want a healthy and high-functioning team, you need to have a healthy and positive team culture. This may sound like a no-brainer, but “culture” is one of those slippery concepts that can be easier to recognize than it is to define. The fact is, culture is the sum of many parts as it includes both the written and unwritten rules that dictate how a team works, communicates and acts. Therefore, you can think of culture as the team’s beating heart – the force behind everything your team stands for and does. It makes sense, then, that all of the world’s most successful organizations pay careful attention to cultivating a healthy culture. Apple, one of the most successful companies in the world, has a strong culture that can be recognized in everything they do. From day one, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak were consciously creating a culture that would not only set them apart but would also inform everything Apple did and how they did it – whether it was hiring, product design or ad campaigns. Decades later, the culture that the two Steves created has proved so strong that this influential heart is still beating fiercely within the company. Nowadays, Apple’s motto is legendary: “Culture beats strategy.” While this is a catchy phrase, it doesn’t mean you can neglect strategy. On the contrary, a smart strategy is important. But it’s your culture that will ultimately determine whether your strategy is successful or not. Now, your team will be looking to its leader to create a positive team culture, but when it comes to making that culture a reality, everyone in a team has a significant role to play. In a study by the Heart Math Institute, researchers found that people can sense another person’s feelings from as far away as ten feet. So, even when you’re not directly in front of someone, it doesn’t let you off the hook in terms of how you’re projecting your energy. There’s another study by Harvard University that suggests that everyone’s emotions are “contagious” since they affect those around them. This means that your cheerful mood – or your grumpy vibe – can spread throughout the team. Everyone and anyone in the team can create a positive or negative ripple-effect depending on their mood. In their attempts to establish a positive team culture, many organizations make a simple but critical mistake: they reward positivity and yet ignore the hints of negativity lurking just below the surface. This may sound relatively harmless, but unaddressed negativity is guaranteed to fester and grow until it eventually infects the whole team. Fortunately, there are reliable cures that can disinfect any team of its lurking negativity. For starters, every team will benefit from making a vow not to be brought down by negativity. For this decision to become a reality, bold action may need to be taken. In 2011, the author was told about one such action when he visited with the University of Georgia’s football team. That year, the team was on a multi-season slump, and the coach was adamant about keeping any subsequent negative feelings away from the team. So, after the next season got off to a rocky start, the coach took the dramatic step of having a vampire painted onto the wall of the team meeting room. This wasn’t just any old vampire, either – it was a “negative energy vampire,” and if any player or coach did anything negative, their photo was placed on the vampire wall. This sent a strong message about just how adamant the coach was about the team staying positive – no matter what. It was also a huge success, as once the vampire emerged, the team broke their losing streak and won their next ten games! Another tactic with proven results is to implement a “no complaining” rule. As the name suggests, this rule forbids any team members from complaining, unless they’re presenting a solution to their complaint. This is terrifically effective at eliminating much of the mindless yet toxic complaining while also promoting and generating solutions. The rule was invented by Dwight Cooper, the CEO of the talent management company PPR, which has been voted one of America’s best workplaces. These days, we have a vast number of ways to communicate: through email, texting and a variety of messaging apps and social media platforms. But the irony is, one of the most common reasons for a dysfunctional team is poor communication. It begs the question: Why are so many teams feeling disconnected when there are so many tools for reaching out to one another? The answer is, with so many different ways of communicating, our messages have become less meaningful. This can lead to disastrous results. Communication voids are formed within teams when members and leaders consistently choose to neglect face-to-face communication in favor of smartphones, email and social media. It’s especially damaging when leaders never communicate with team members one-on-one. When this happens, negativity can easily fill the communication void as rumors, gossip and complaints replace trust and cooperation. When faced with the void, it’s only a matter of time before team members begin to assume the worst and adopt a mind-set of fear and survival. There’s only one thing that can restore the balance and keep negativity at bay: clear communication. Therefore, a powerful and positive team must combat negativity by prioritizing regular, meaningful communication. Fortunately, there are a number of ways to promote healthy communication methods within your team. For example, the author has seen success with sales teams that schedule daily conference calls where learning opportunities, achievements and obstacles are discussed. You may think that working remotely means you have to forego normal, beneficial communication, but that’s not the case. Even if you’re not in the office, you can establish daily or weekly video conferences. Mealtimes are also great opportunities to connect team members. Leaders especially can benefit from regularly eating lunch with a different colleague each week, to strengthen bonds. It takes more than one superstar to create a winning team. Extraordinary teams require the collaboration of extraordinary members who are committed to achieving greatness. You may think Oscar-winning actors do it all by themselves, but in reality, each one has a whole crew of dedicated individuals who made their performance possible, from the writer, director and cinematographer to the set designer. Just because we don’t see them on the movie screen doesn’t mean they’re not an invaluable part of the process. For greatness to happen, it takes the care and commitment of every individual working together. Committing to a team means that me turns into we, and one of the special things that happens when a team like this comes together is that it can now achieve things that people on their own cannot. Business coach and former Navy SEAL, Nick Hays, will never forget “Hell Week,” the most brutal and dreaded part of the SEAL selection process. Part of the week involves a 200-mile run while soaking wet and on the verge of hypothermia, with each night providing less than four hours’ sleep. The recruits who were first to quit before the week was up were the ones who focused primarily on themselves. They couldn’t see beyond their own pain and discomfort. By not committing to the team, they didn’t draw strength from the other members and therefore didn’t have what was needed to complete the grueling week. The recruits who did become SEALS were more committed to their team than to themselves. They bonded, motivated each other and wouldn’t dare quit for fear of letting the team down. It takes a desire and a genuine consideration and caring to connect with and commit to your team. Once you do, great things can happen. One day, when Steve Jobs was a kid, his dad was building a fence, and young Steve asked him why he was putting so much care into painting the back of the fence, which no one would ever see. His father replied, “But you will know.” Steve Jobs’s father taught him to genuinely care about every project he took on, and he internalized that wisdom and put it to work in the products he made later. With Apple, he took so much care that those early products still inspire awe and passion among the company’s team and their millions of loyal customers. If you’ve ever been fortunate enough be part of a powerful, positive team, you’ll know that it’s not just fun and games. With a commitment to achieving greatness, there also comes a striving – a desire to improve yourself for the betterment of the team. This means that an exceptional team isn’t just a collection of individuals committed to one another, they’re also committed to self-improvement as part of the overall pursuit of excellence. Every member of a great and positive team is endlessly restless and always looking for new ways to improve, grow and learn. Knowing this can help you spot a truly exceptional team. Just look for the ones with people who are both hungry and humble. Seek out the team of people who are not afraid to be uncomfortable if it means they’ll grow and learn. The individuals in the best teams are the kind who are unwilling to settle for mediocrity. Instead, they challenge the status quo while keeping their eyes firmly locked on the prize of greatness. Another powerful tip that you can introduce for self-improvement and achieving greatness is the one percent rule. When this rule is in place, each team member agrees to show up to work and give one percent more energy, effort, focus and time than they gave yesterday. Of course, a one-percent daily improvement is practically impossible to quantify, but nevertheless, the rule gets results. The author saw it put to effective use in a women’s college lacrosse team. Each of the team’s 35 players agreed to the rule, and in the spirit of positive thinking and teamwork, they believed that the combined improvement should amount to a 35 percent increase across the whole team each day. Naturally, this is a significant amount of growth, and by being committed to seeing it happen the team did indeed experience an incredible improvement. This team of 35 lacrosse players is a perfect example of the power that can be created when positivity, commitment and selflessness come together in the pursuit of greatness. The key message in these blinks: Great teamwork is built on fostering positivity and optimism by promoting a culture that values commitment, care and clear communication between all team members. It leaves no room for negativity to seep in. A positive team is built up of individuals who are devoted to one another and to constant self-improvement, with the knowledge that their efforts can make amazing things happen.  Actionable advice: Care comes before criticism.  A functioning team requires its members to give one another constructive criticism from time to time since this is part of the process for improvement. You should be aware that people are more receptive to criticism when they believe the person providing it has their best interests at heart. No one appreciates criticism from someone who doesn’t seem to care about them. So it’s wise to learn and care about each team member while being sure to express that caring attitude on a daily basis.

There are few happy endings for British PMs. But what distinguishes these complex, vastly different politicians from one another? What were the personality traits that determined the way they governed? To understand the United Kingdom today – its ongoing argument around the European Union, its economic policies and its social attitudes – you could do worse than reflect on the leaders who have done so much to shape it. In these blinks, you’ll learn about the guile of Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson; how Margaret Thatcher ripped up the old status quo; and why David Cameron was so ill-prepared for Brexit. The British prime minister’s office has often been the stage for Shakespearian high drama – great triumph, betrayal and crushing defeat. To survive for long, prime ministers require diverse and subtle qualities that go beyond pure intellect or ideological conviction. Though some of these qualities are almost indescribable – supernatural luck, or a sixth sense for the nation’s mood – there are a few clear ones that we can pin down. First off, the ability to communicate effectively is a must. Take Margaret Thatcher. In the 1980s, she planned radical changes to the British economy. She wanted to shrink the state and cut public services – radical policies which would cause many of her own voters a considerable degree of discomfort. However, she was able to explain and justify her ideas in a way that appealed to many. She spoke of “choice” and “freedom,” words that were euphemisms for the free-market economics she wanted to implement. Who could reject “freedom” and “choice”? Second, leaders must be ready to respond fluently to changing media narratives. A leader like Tony Blair, for instance, was able to take hostile stories and subvert them to his government’s advantage. Facing opposition to policies, like market reforms in the National Health Service (NHS) or the introduction of tuition fees for university, Blair was always quick to appear before the media at one of his regular press conferences. By the end of it, he nearly always managed to disarm and reassure reporters with his sophisticated explanations. Third, most leaders have to unite very divided parties. To do this, they must be able to balance competing forces and use masterful diplomacy. Take Labour’s James Callaghan, prime minister from 1976 to 1979, who took office not long after the 1975 referendum on the UK’s membership in the European Economic Community (EEC). He led a party of passionate Europhiles and Eurosceptics, but was able to keep them united by giving the most influential figures from both sides important ministerial posts. If any of the above qualities are missing, a prime minister will certainly struggle. Some possess real intellect, for instance, but are ill-suited to the demands of leadership more broadly. Consider Labour’s Gordon Brown, who took office after Tony Blair resigned in 2007. He was one of the most thoughtful men to have been involved in British politics. But he lacked Blair’s nimbleness before the media, and Thatcher’s ability to simplify grand ideas. Consequently, his ratings fell as he took office, as the British public decided, cruelly, that he was too dour. He would lose his first election in 2010, and Labour left office after thirteen years in power. In the next blink, we’ll consider how public opinion can be unfair to British prime ministers. The rise and fall of British prime ministers are often very swift. Public opinion and the Westminster media circus are unforgiving. The ways in which prime ministers are characterized can often be deeply unfair and simplistic. Over time, the media pigeonholes prime ministers. For instance, Labour’s Harold Wilson, who governed the UK from 1964 to 1970 and 1974 to 1976, was widely reviled by the newspapers and the nominally objective public broadcaster, the BBC, who attempted to sketch him as a uniquely drab figure. Likewise, the Tory leader John Major was depicted as a weak, ineffectual man during his tenure from 1990 to 1997. Once the seeds were planted, these impressions tended to stick in the public consciousness. The truth, of course, is much more nuanced. The complexities of high office demand a much wider array of attributes than these reductive fictions would have it. Both Wilson and Major, regardless of their media stereotypes, displayed depth and variety. Rather than drabness, Wilson enacted powerful social reform, like scrapping the death penalty. Major, far from being weak, was able to turn the page on Thatcherism and adapt the Conservatives’ divisive economic policies of the 1980s. Although all PMs are assailed by the British media to a certain extent, left-wing prime ministers are especially badly misrepresented. In truth, most Labour leaders feel as if they’re impostors in an essentially right-wing country. Whether this is true or not, a majority of newspapers in the UK are aggressively right-wing, and their news agenda tends to determine what is covered by the BBC as well. Harold Wilson, as we’ve mentioned, was particularly harshly treated by the media. The author, an early follower of Wilson, describes a campaign rally he attended in 1974, in a packed town hall in north London.  As Wilson came onto the stage, he appeared aged, gray and washed-up. Then, he began to speak flatly about certain policy promises. The author began to wonder whether the newspaper clichés were correct.  But then, suddenly, a protestor threw an egg and hit Wilson in the face. This transformed the Labour leader, who quickly revived, and, brushing off the yolk, let loose a stream of elegant jokes and exciting promises about a future socialist government. The crowd left enraptured, convinced again by their old figurehead.  The truth, of course, is that none of Britain’s prime ministers has ever been the simple caricature often presented on the front pages of newspapers. Harold Wilson was a great survivor, winning three elections in 1964, 1966 and 1974. This was an astounding achievement for a Labour leader, matched only by Tony Blair.  Such an achievement required a masterful grasp of political maneuvering. Consider the way Wilson managed the 1975 referendum on Britain’s relationship with Europe. Although Wilson’s own view was that the UK should remain as part of the European Common Market (the precursor to the European Union), the Labour Party had some deep divisions on this issue. Significantly, some of Labour’s most powerful cabinet figures were on different sides. They risked looking like a hopelessly disunited party, which would have serious consequences for any future elections. So, cleverly, Wilson decided that he would allow different members of his party to campaign whichever way they liked. Thus, on one hand, anti-marketeers on the Left, like Tony Benn and Michael Foot, would campaign to leave the Common Market, while those in favor of it, like Roy Jenkins and Shirley Williams, would pitch to remain. In this fashion, Wilson managed to hold a fractured party together. By 1975, he also understood that he had become nationally unpopular. As a result, he feared that some voters might use the referendum as a chance to vote against him. So to achieve his preferred outcome – remaining in Europe – he made himself virtually invisible during the campaign. Votes would then be less likely to be used as a protest against him. Another example of his adept leadership was the way he dealt with labor unions in the 1970s. This was a decade of crisis: there were deep-rooted problems in the British economy, affecting traditional industries most of all. Against this backdrop, there were ongoing disputes with miners, organized by the National Union of Mineworkers. They had demanded a pay raise, which triggered a whole host of other industries to do the same. Rather than openly confronting the unions, which were closely connected to the Labour movement, Wilson opted for a “third way.” He declared that raises could be determined by each industry, but if they failed to adhere to sensible limits in any agreement with his government, he would use emergency measures to enforce tough guidelines. It was a clever convolution that allowed him to appear as though he backed the unions, while, in reality, he was keeping them in check. And with guile like that, he survived the bearpit of British politics. As the troubled 1970s drew to a close – a decade of strike action and high inflation – a new figure moved into view. This figure would change everything. Her rise seemed unstoppable, inevitable, as if driven by a powerful wind. This, of course, was Margaret Thatcher. To begin with, she overthrew the old Conservative Party establishment. From humble beginnings in the Midlands town of Grantham, Thatcher had been a dedicated Tory activist from an early age. She quickly rose through the party ranks, becoming an MP in 1959, then Environment Secretary under Prime Minister Ted Heath in 1970. After the Tories lost the November 1974 election, she ran for the leadership, and won as the surprise outsider. In that contest, she made a name for herself as a tax-cutting, free-market candidate of the radical right. This marked a real shift in the party’s political configuration. Ted Heath and much of the party establishment considered themselves “One Nation” Conservatives. This was a more moderate and paternalistic form of conservatism that still saw an important role for the active state. When Thatcher won the leadership contest against Ted Heath, he was heard to say, “It has all gone wrong, then.” By that he meant that his One Nation Conservatism was no more. When she won her first election, in 1979, Thatcher’s economic agenda represented just as much of an overthrow of the status quo. By presenting herself as an antidote to the chaos of the 1970s, she was able to sell her very radical reforms. Her policies centered around deregulation, low taxation and low public spending. In real terms, this meant businesses benefited from tax reduction, but many working people suffered from the erosion of the welfare state. It also meant that traditional manufacturing industries were wiped out as the deregulatory economic policies threatened their survival. Welsh mining towns and Scottish shipyards suffered terribly. Thatcher marked a sea-change in British politics. The country moved beyond post-war social democracy to a free-market economy.  And her influence was lasting. When asked what her greatest achievement was, she famously replied “Tony Blair” – meaning that the dominance of her ideas had transformed even the Labour Party. Margaret Thatcher was dramatically deposed in 1990 by MPs from her own party. Her successor couldn’t have been more different. John Major, who took the reins in November of that year, was determined to steer the party back to its moderate tradition, after Thatcher’s right-wing leadership. Indeed, Major’s time as leader marked the return of One Nation Toryism. Soon after taking over, he scrapped one of Thatcher’s most contentious policies, her so-called “Poll Tax” – a flat-rate tax on every adult. As the tax had hit the less-affluent hard, it stirred great opposition. There were large riots in London in March 1990. Major’s move to end the Poll Tax signaled a softer kind of Toryism. There were other signs of this move leftward. For instance, early in Major’s tenure, during Prime Minister’s Questions, a backbench Tory MP asked a pointed question about the BBC. The BBC – the state-funded broadcaster – was a frequent target of the political right, who believed, erroneously, that it was staffed by socialists. Instead of offering the expected anti-BBC polemic, Major turned around and gave a spirited defense of the institution. He was also conscious of how Thatcher had eroded public services with her cuts, and attempted some halfway measures to repair them. However, before he could make a real impact with domestic policy, John Major’s tenure was troubled by the seemingly never-ending European question.   Though still skeptical of European integration Major was much more moderate and pro-Europe than many of his MPs. This brought him to conflict with many in his party again and again. For example, in 1992, the UK had signed the founding document of the EU, the Maastricht Treaty. Tory hardliners, enraged by Major’s acceptance of more integration, launched crippling rebellions in parliament. In fact, the UK had won several opt-outs from the Treaty, notably avoiding in its entirety the “Social Chapter,” a set of measures designed to improve working conditions and rights for all European citizens. However, this wasn’t enough for these MPs, whose rebellions signaled to the electorate that the Tories were deeply divided. And in the UK, divided parties don’t win elections. Predictably, in 1997, they were swept away by Tony Blair’s Labour. John Major wouldn’t be the last Conservative prime minister to be destroyed by the issue of Europe. In 1994, Tony Blair became leader of the Labour Party, after a decade and a half of Tory rule. By this time,  John Major was crashing in the polls, and things looked promising for Labour.  However, Blair had been an MP during the crushing election defeats of the 1980s, and was anxious not to make the same mistakes. He had become something of a student of the political campaign, after being schooled in the crucible of defeat. He and his political ally, Labour’s Director of Communications, Peter Mandelson, had studied every mistake in every disastrous campaign against Thatcher’s election-winning juggernaut. Then, they concocted ways in which they could convince voters back to the Labour cause. They “bomb-proofed” their policies and campaign messaging – testing them with focus groups, prodding them for weaknesses – until they were sure that the Labour manifesto wouldn’t scare off potential voters. Labour manifestos in the past had been attacked as too left-wing by the media: the radical 1983 manifesto had famously been labeled the “longest suicide note in history.” Blair was intent on not making the same errors. He also made himself approachable, spoke a cheerful, colloquial language, and was often photographed in casual attire. He courted the media, too – even Rupert Murdoch’s notorious, Tory-supporting Sun. When the 1997 election finally came, Labour was polling way ahead of John Major’s worn-out Tory Party. But Blair was still cautious, scarred by defeat. He needn't have been. When the exit poll was announced at 10 p.m., the result was emphatic: a Labour landslide, wiping out the Tories across the UK.  After his victory, Blair governed much as he had campaigned, in what he called the “Third Way” or the “radical center.” In truth, it was a political offer that essentially kept the main parts of Thatcherism intact. Market forces had to be allowed to work freely, and statism would be kept in check. With this said, Blair’s Labour government increased public spending and was able to implement progressive policies that improved many working people’s lives. These were things like the minimum wage, Sure Start centers for disadvantaged children and much-needed extra funding for the NHS.  Through clever triangulation, Tony Blair had got Labour elected and cemented their place in government – something that had seemed impossible for nearly two decades. In 2005, after eight years in the wilderness, the Tories chose a new leader, the thirty-nine-year-old David Cameron. They’d lost three elections under deeply unpopular leaders, and seemed a spent force. When David Cameron first appeared, he was hailed as the fresh face on the block, but he had little experience of high office. Slick, bright and self-confident, he had come up fast through the Tory ranks, serving as a parliamentary advisor to John Major at the tail end of his premiership. However, Cameron didn’t have the formative experience of other prime ministers – those struggles that shape and temper a prospective leader. In comparison, Tony Blair had fought the long battles of the 1980s, and had developed a sophisticated ideological stance. Cameron seemed to have passed from private school through Oxford University straight to prestigious positions in the Conservative Party. This lack of experience meant that he was ill-suited to deal with the complex problems he faced when he was elected in 2010. The most notable of these was the European question, which began to plague the Tories once again when they returned to office.  Under pressure from rowdy Eurosceptic members of his party and Nigel Farage’s UK Independence Party (UKIP), Cameron called a referendum in 2016 to settle the issue once and for all. The issue was dubbed “Brexit,” – Britain’s potential exit from the European Union.  Taking up the “remain” side of the argument, he assumed that he would win the referendum easily. The polls showed reasonable leads for the remain side, and as Cameron had won a small majority in the 2015 general election, he presumed that his winning streak would continue. Unlike Harold Wilson, who acknowledged his own unpopularity, Cameron made the mistake of putting himself at the center of the campaign. When the shock “leave” result came through in June 2016, it became apparent that part of its appeal had been as a protest against his leadership. On the morning of June 24, 2016, David Cameron resigned abruptly, and left the political stage. As the “leave” result sank in, the British pound crashed and the government fell apart, it became clear that Cameron had gambled with the country’s economic future for political self-interest, and then abandoned the whole mess. The verdict on his period in office is often severe – and, notably, there is little disagreement. In the chaos following the 2016 Brexit vote, the former Home Secretary, Theresa May, quickly became leader of the Conservative Party. It was a short leadership contest, in which all the other contestants dropped out. Theresa May was left to govern a newly divided country. As she sought control of the situation, May positioned herself as someone who would solve “the burning injustices” that had contributed to the leave vote winning. Subsequently, she became very popular. To strengthen her hand, in April 2017 she called a snap general election, in which she assumed she would crush her opposition. During that campaign, in which she faced the left-wing Jeremy Corbyn as leader of the Labour Party, she made some serious missteps. The first was assuming that the electorate desired an election at all. They simply didn’t: the referendum had been a deeply divisive event and the nation was worn out. Second, her manifesto included a policy for funding social care that became known as the “dementia tax,” as it forced elderly people to pay for their own care. Third, she let slip in one interview that she was in favor of fox-hunting – something that a great majority of the nation opposed. Even so, against a genuine socialist like Corbyn, she was expected to win a big majority. The result, on June 8, was a hung parliament, with Labour taking seats from the Tories. May’s big gamble had failed. Now, with no majority, she pursued a Brexit strategy that didn’t reflect the new House of Commons. With no consideration for the demands of other parties, she negotiated a Brexit deal that simply reflected the Tories’ own priorities. For example, she was determined to stop the freedom of movement that allowed people from other EU countries to live and work in Britain, a policy that was defended by many of the other parties. Consequently, when she brought the deal to be voted on in parliament, it was defeated numerous times. Labour, Liberal Democrats, the Scottish National Party and a chunk of her own party didn’t support it. Then, ministers who desired a much harder Brexit resigned, like the former Mayor of London, Boris Johnson. With her authority shattered, she staggered on a while longer, facing a No Confidence vote by her own party. She won, but, in the eyes of the nation, had lost authority. Suffering enormous losses at the local council and European elections in 2019, May resigned, defeated by the same issue that had sunk Major and Cameron, and one that looks unlikely to subside in the future. The key message in these blinks: Over the decades, Britain has elected vastly different characters to the office of prime minister, each of them coming with his or her own distinctive personalities, ideologies and character flaws. They have all shaped the nation in their own ways – some more profoundly than others. Rather than the simple caricatures of the newspaper headlines, each prime minister has been a nuanced, complex individual. Their different premierships go a long way to explaining the current state of the UK. Got feedback? We’d sure love to hear what you think about our content!

What to read next: Why We Get the Wrong Politicians by Isabel Hardman  You’ve taken a tour through the annals of Westminster and learned about British prime ministers from Harold Wilson to Theresa May. Many of these figures had admirable qualities – whether Thatcher’s dynamism or Wilson’s quiet reforming zeal. However, we often manage to elect weak, corrupt or unrepresentative politicians. In the British electoral system in particular, there’s a model in place that means that the electorate gets some of the most ill-suited people possible representing them. This is because of a parliamentary culture of entitlement and an MP selection process that doesn’t discriminate effectively enough. To delve deeper into why some politicians aren’t always best suited for the job, get the blinks to Isabel Hardman’s Why We Get The Wrong Politicians.","headers":["What’s in it for me?

That’s the major insight of the reciprocity advantage, which shows that the companies who are willing to give something up, share something, or collaborate are the companies that have an advantage over their competitors. Whether it’s old stuff you find in your company’s symbolic “basement,” or know-how you’ve built up over the years and aren’t using to its full value, this pack will show you how to find that underutilized asset you already own and can share with others! In fact, anecdotes from major companies and organizations like the US military, TED, Google, IBM, Lego, and many more prove that in an ever-changing world, the reciprocity advantage is the best way to push your organization forward. In these blinks, you’ll find out what Lego pays people for ideas; why Google set up faster wi-fi for the whole of Kansas City; and how TEDx saved TED. Have you got a basement full of junk that you scarcely touch? Many companies have a figurative basement full of assets that go unused. But just because something isn’t used, doesn’t mean it’s useless! The stuff in the figurative basement, or unutilized assets, may hold great possibilities for creating new, mutually beneficial partnerships. IBM is an outstanding example of this. As personal computers shrank in size in the mid1980s, IBM struggled to keep its bigger computers relevant in the market. To address this challenge, the company looked at what else it could offer, and realized that over the years it had built up a lot of in-house competence in managing and analyzing data: an underutilized asset. So instead of falling behind the times, IBM used this know-how as a base for new products and services, helping companies manage and analyze large data sets. Today, IBM partners with governments, agencies and companies to create solutions that their clients wouldn’t be able to come up with otherwise, such as redistributing traffic flow for improved travel within the city of Istanbul. And their service-oriented approach is highly profitable. In 2000, IBM’s profits from software were $2.6 billion, with $3.3 billion in hardware. But by 2012, their software profits had soared to $10.8 billion, while hardware showed very little growth. What if IBM had never thought of turning to services? Learn from IBM: sometimes admitting defeat in one area can lead to a new, more productive path in your business. In this way, even enemies can become good partners. Take Microsoft’s Kinect, a gaming platform that used sensors to track body movement. Shortly after its launch in 2010, the platform was hacked. Microsoft fought back at first but after realizing it was futile, the company decided to partner with the hackers and open up the platform for anyone to modify. The technology, initially meant only for gaming, has now spawned a wide range of applications, and the software development kit for Kinect has been downloaded millions of times all over the world. Microsoft could not have gained such a wide reach without its hacker partners. Right now, all over the world communal areas where people come together to share resources and knowledge are popping up like mushrooms. These maker spaces have proved to be powerful engines for both collaboration and innovation. Companies certainly have a lot to learn from them. Maker spaces show that sometimes, the point isn’t necessarily to create profitable products. Rather, we gain far more by attempting to build and learn together. TechSpace, a maker space in Menlo Park, California, is brimming with hackers, entrepreneurs and keen experimenters. Not only do all kinds of people help each other with their projects, but successful companies are emerging from the process. One example is Square, a plug-in device for smartphones that enables credit card transactions. After making prototype upon prototype and using the TechSpace community to test them, Square quickly became a prosperous business. If companies want to stand a chance in the future, they must experiment with new ways of making money. Google is ahead of the game in this respect. In 2011 Google selected Kansas City as the first city to get the high speed internet system called Google Fiber, which increased the existing bandwidth a hundredfold. For Google, however, this wasn’t primarily about testing new technology. What Google was really doing was investigating the possibilities of a reciprocity advantage. The experiment was a success. Today, Kansas has become a haven for hackers and makers who are using the increase in bandwidth to develop new products and services. So what does Google get out of it? Well, in early 2014, Google announced it would take Google Fiber to 34 cities around the United States. The increase in bandwidth and the rapidly growing number of users made it possible for Google to collect usage data much faster, which is extremely valuable as they continue to build new platforms and services. Today, the internet allows us to scale a company in ways that would have seemed pure fantasy just 20 years ago. If you’re willing to share and co-create with others, there is no limit to how much you can grow. Sharing speeds up your growth without hurting your core business. A case in point is TED and TEDx. When architect Richard Wurman created TED in 1984, it was intended to be the world’s most elite conference. But when Chris Anderson took over TED in 2001, he wanted to maintain TED’s spirit, while also opening it up to new interaction and collaborations. So he started TEDx, allowing anyone to hold a conference. TEDx mushroomed, and the TED brand spread all over the world. TEDx partners can use the TED brand and logo, and have the freedom to run their events as they please. But TED retains control by promoting good talks and limiting the reach of bad ones. Meanwhile, TEDx works as a spawning ground for new TED speakers. Instead of hurting the core business, TEDx made the “real” TED conferences more popular than ever. Other new technologies will also allow your business to scale with ease by working with huge networks of partners. Take 3D printing. Since products will no longer be physically produced by a company, but printed at home instead, manufacturing and distribution will both be disrupted and scaled enormously. Just imagine having partners all over the world who can tweak and improve an existing product, and then uploading it to the cloud, giving the world instant access to it. Quite an extraordinary thought! So what can we learn here? Well, for one thing, it makes no sense to be afraid of the revolutionary change that collaboration can bring. Rather, you should look forward to expanding your process to include others, so you’ll open up a whole new world of possibilities, and success. You may have heard the term digital natives being thrown around in reference to people who were 18 years old or younger in 2014. This isn’t just some new buzzword – digital natives have radically different attitudes toward companies, and the way they interact with them is bound to create change. They are the key to creating partnerships for the future. Digital natives are bound to disrupt traditional methods for companies to make money. How? A good example can be found in intellectual property. The generation currently growing up will be diametrically opposed to intellectual property rights, and the companies trying to make money by selling them. So what should a company do if it wants to survive? Instead of seeking to protect their intellectual property, it’s time to explore what can be gained by sharing it. Another example of the way the younger generation is changing business is crowdfunding. Sites like Kickstarter and Indiegogo demonstrate just how powerful online communities can be in not just selling your product, but also making it possible in the first place. It’s becoming easier and easier to start companies without having to look to traditional investors for support. It’s clear these digital natives are the most important potential partners for the coming decade. So how can companies get them on their side? Future companies will have to rethink concepts like “consumer,” “advertising,” and “commercials.” In order to attract the digital natives you have to engage with them, not simply sell something to them. Relationships with digital natives will also become crucial for international corporations over the next ten years. Major reciprocity advantages will result from partnerships between these corporations and very small players in emerging markets in developing countries. Instead of having an innovation department of ten people brainstorming in a stuffy conference room, why not have 10,000 people brainstorming for you? Having access to a global community of connected users won’t just affect how and when we work. It will change the very way companies innovate. Companies today feature employees that perform certain jobs. This is all starting to change. In the future, jobs will be broken down and distributed online. Take Task Rabbit, for example. Task Rabbit is an online forum that allows individuals to perform all kinds of everyday tasks for you, such as walking your dog or picking up your groceries. One of the most common tasks that people request is putting together IKEA furniture – no surprise there! Working arrangements in which jobs traditionally performed by one person are broken down into smaller parts and distributed online will become much more common. In turn, future companies can become more flexible and agile than ever before. Companies are also changing the way they innovate by letting customers do the work. Open innovation has become a vital concept over the past few years. It works to open up your innovation process by inviting your customers to provide new ideas or solutions to a problem. Customers themselves can be attracted to the task through competitions with cash prizes or a share of the profit when an idea is taken all the way to the product stage. A notable example is Lego’s CUUSOO, an online platform where anyone can submit ideas for new Lego sets, and vote for ideas that they think are winners. The ideas with the most votes are developed further by Lego, and if they’re taken to market, the person who contributed the initial idea receives one percent of the net profit. If you think games are just entertainment, think again! They can be much more – like simulations of the future or a means to bond with others. An ever-growing number of companies around the globe are discovering how to use gaming to their advantage. Games are a proven way to engage more genuinely with customers. Economist Edward Castronova has studied players of large online games to try and grasp exactly why it is that people play. If you’d have guessed escapism, competition or entertainment, you’d better guess again. People game for the positive emotions that they experience after accomplishing a task, and for being recognized by others for their achievements. Take Minecraft, for example, an online game which isn’t about scoring or winning. It allows you to build things with others using simple building blocks, and today has over 100 million registered players. Just imagine the possibilities for companies that learn to tap into the power of people playing and building together. Not only will games bring us together in the future, they can also aid us in experiencing the future, right now. With games, we can simulate situations at low risk in order to better prepare ourselves. One of the leaders in this field is the US military, who have long used games to simulate live combat situations. At the National Training Center for the Army (NTC) in the Mojave Desert, soldiers play round-the-clock war games for up to two weeks so that they are as well-prepared as possible for the real thing. And it’s not just the soldiers that learn through playing. The military also get vital information on how to improve their operations. Companies have a lot to learn from this use of video games. Just as the railroads opened up a whole new world of commerce in the 1800s, the cloud will open up major new possibilities for reaching more customers and scaling your business. In fact, the cloud is the infrastructure of the future. And we’ve only seen the beginning. From what we’ve seen so far, it’s clear that cloud computing will speed up innovation to an astonishing rate. Cloud computing will function as a medium for those shared assets, or commons, that we can all benefit from. Not only will cloud computing make it easier to increase the commons, but also for us to access and make use of them. What’s more, improved connectivity through cloud computing will create a shift in business models, as those based on sharing, lending, borrowing and trading will be made both viable, scalable and highly profitable. Cloud computing will also allow us to connect and partner in spite of language barriers. You might think of the internet as a predominantly English language domain. But in fact, the Chinese language internet is about the same size as the English language one. Multilingual tools will make building relationships between these two domains far easier. But how? One such tool that can help us get there is machine translation, which, through cloud computing, will become much faster and more intelligent. Many modern machine translation tools have built-in self-learning mechanisms, allowing them to improve over time by analyzing millions of documents. The growth of the cloud will in turn speed up this process. The key message in this book: Sharing and working together with others in new ways will be the key to competitive advantage in the future. Actionable advice: Don’t think product, think service!  By redefining your business as a service you can locate assets you haven’t yet utilized, like know-how and experience built up over the years. The next step is to try and find ways to share this with others to create mutually beneficial partnerships.
